# Railway Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the Emreq AI Engineering Manager to Railway.

## Architecture

The deployment includes:
- **FastAPI Backend**: Serves the AI agent API with streaming responses
- **Authentication**: Supabase integration for user management
- **Profile System**: Complete user profile management with personalization
- **AI Agent**: Emreq engineering manager with memory and tools

## Prerequisites

1. **Railway Account**: Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **Supabase Project**: Your Supabase database with employee_profiles table
3. **OpenAI API Key**: For the AI agent (GPT-4)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect to Railway

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize project (from your repo root)
railway init
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables

In your Railway dashboard, add these environment variables:

#### Required Variables:
```bash
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key

# Supabase Configuration  
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key

# Frontend URL (for CORS - set after frontend deployment)
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-nextjs-app.vercel.app
```

#### Optional Variables:
```bash
# For additional API providers (if using)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-key
```

### 3. Deploy Backend

```bash
# Deploy the FastAPI backend
railway up
```

The backend will be available at: `https://your-service.railway.app`

### 4. Deploy Frontend (Vercel Recommended)

For the Next.js frontend, we recommend deploying to Vercel:

```bash
cd nextjs-app

# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
```

### 5. Update CORS Settings

After deploying the frontend, update the `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable in Railway with your Vercel URL.

## API Endpoints

Once deployed, your Railway backend will provide:

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `POST /api/chat` - Non-streaming chat
- `POST /api/chat/stream` - Streaming chat (recommended)
- `GET /agents` - List available agents

## Frontend Integration

Update your Next.js app's API calls to use the Railway backend:

```typescript
// In your API routes or client code
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
  ? 'https://your-service.railway.app'
  : 'http://localhost:8001'
```

## Testing the Deployment

1. **Health Check**: Visit `https://your-service.railway.app/health`
2. **Frontend**: Test the complete flow with authentication and profile
3. **Personalization**: Verify that Emreq uses your profile data

## Monitoring

Railway provides built-in monitoring:
- **Logs**: View real-time application logs
- **Metrics**: Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage
- **Deployments**: Track deployment history

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **CORS Errors**: Ensure `FRONTEND_URL` is set correctly
2. **Supabase Connection**: Verify all Supabase environment variables
3. **OpenAI Errors**: Check API key and quota
4. **Profile Loading**: Ensure RLS policies allow profile access

### Debug Commands:

```bash
# View logs
railway logs

# Connect to shell
railway shell

# Check environment variables
railway variables
```

## Production Considerations

1. **Security**: All API keys are properly configured as environment variables
2. **CORS**: Restricted to your frontend domain
3. **Health Checks**: Enabled for Railway monitoring
4. **Auto-scaling**: Railway handles scaling automatically
5. **SSL**: HTTPS enabled by default

## Cost Optimization

- Railway charges based on usage
- The FastAPI backend is lightweight and efficient
- Consider using Railway's sleep mode for development environments

## Next Steps

After deployment:
1. Test all functionality with real users
2. Monitor performance and logs
3. Set up custom domain if needed
4. Configure backup strategies for your Supabase data
