Today, I\u2019m joined by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ebiatawodi/\">Ebi Atawodi</a>, Director of Product Management at <strong>YouTube Studio</strong>, and a former product leader at <strong>Netflix</strong> and <strong>Uber</strong>.</p><p>Ebi was the first PM I partnered with after stepping into engineering management at Uber, and we both learned a lot together. We share lessons from our time at Uber and discuss how strong product-engineering partnerships drive better outcomes, grow teams, foster cultures of ownership, and unlock agency, innovation, and trust.</p><p>In this episode, we cover:</p><ul><li><p>Why you need to earn a new team's trust before trying to drive change</p></li><li><p>How practices like the \"business scorecard\" and \u201cState of the Union\u201d updates helped communicate business goals and impact to teams at Uber</p></li><li><p>How understanding business impact leads to more ideas and collaboration</p></li><li><p>A case for getting to know your team as people, not just employees</p></li><li><p>Why junior employees should have a conversation with a recruiter every six months</p></li><li><p>Ebi\u2019s approach to solving small problems with the bet that they\u2019ll unlock larger, more impactful solutions</p></li><li><p>Why investing time in trust and connection isn't at odds with efficiency</p></li><li><p>The qualities of the best engineers\u2014and why they\u2019re the same traits that make people successful in any role</p></li><li><p>The three-pronged definition of product: business impact, feasibility, and customer experience</p></li><li><p>Why you should treat your career as a project</p></li><li><p>And more!</p></li></ul><h2>Takeaways</h2><p>This episode is different to most podcasts in how both Ebi and myself share our learnings on how we went from a rocky engineering/product relationship to a very productive one.</p><p>My biggest learnings:</p><p><strong>Product-minded engineers get more things done: so become one </strong>\u2014 and if you are a PM or EM, help your engineers become one! One of the biggest gifts from Ebi, myself, and our engineering team was helping all of us become product-minded engineers. Ebi exposed us to how Product worked, made decisions, allocated headcount, and pitched new initiatives to be funded by the business. <em>I wrote more on <a href=\"https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/\">how to become a product-minded engineer</a>.</em></p><p><strong>Work like a startup \u2014 even inside a large company.</strong> Our organizational unit inside Uber kept growing in business impact and headcount year after year, because we worked like a startup. Teams had clear <em>business</em> goals that translated to things like revenue increase, cost decrease, incremental new Riders, net new first Riders, and other metrics that the business (Uber) cared about. Within Ebi\u2019s product organization, we prioritized the most impactful projects across teams, and teams (engineering and product teams) helped ship the most important ones, even if they were technically not part of one team\u2019s roadmap. We worked with the assumption that we must help the business reach its goals, and if we don\u2019t, our charter (and team) would potentially have no reason to exist. </p><p>Working this way is challenging when you have the resources of a large organization, but doing so helps your company \u2014 plus, it helps every engineer build a \u201cproduct-minded engineer\u201d muscle that can be very helpful if you later found a startup, or become a founding engineer at one. <em>We covered more on this topic in <a href=\"https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/thriving-as-a-founding-engineer\">Thriving as a founding engineer: lessons from the trenches</a>.</em></p><p><strong>Get to know the person behind the EM/PM/engineer/colleague. </strong>At work, roles are somewhat artificial. What is not artificial is the person behind the role. It made a massive difference when I got to know the \u201creal Ebi\u201d behind \u201cEbi, the product manager\u201d \u2014 and the other way around, about \u201cGergely, the engineering manager.\u201d It\u2019s a lot easier to trust a partner when you know more about them than \u201cjust\u201d their role at work.</p><p><strong>Focus on doing great work as an engineer \u2014 first and foremost. </strong>As tempting as it is to \u201cgame the system\u201d of performance reviews or promotions: both Ebi and I agree that you absolutely can game whatever system your company has in place to fast-track that next promotion, or try to get better performance reviews. But the people who do this, others around them notice \u2014 especially engineers! What speeds them up in the short term often slows them down in the long term. This is because more senior positions often need strong referrals: and someone who was visibly focused on their own advancement only can struggle to get these.</p><p>Do standout work, help others when you can, and be kind to others around you, and years later, other standout colleagues could well tap your shoulder, wanting to recruit you to the companies they are currently at. <em>This is how Ebi often got recruited for increasingly senior roles.</em></p><h2><strong>The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode</strong></h2><ul><li><p><a

The team introduced a new tech stack called the \u201cCore Stack\u201d \u2013 all the while users remained largely unaware of the changes. What drove this overhaul, and how did the team pull it off?</p><p>In this episode of The Pragmatic Engineer, I\u2019m joined by three engineers from Reddit\u2019s mobile platform team who led this work: Lauren Darcey (Head of Mobile Platform), Brandon Kobilansky (iOS Platform Lead), and Eric Kuck (Principal Android Engineer). We discuss how the team transitioned to a modern architecture, revamped their testing strategy, improved developer experience \u2013 while they also greatly improved the app\u2019s user experience.</p><p>We also get into:</p><ul><li><p>How Reddit structures its mobile teams\u2014and why iOS and Android remain intentionally separate</p></li><li><p>The scale of Reddit\u2019s mobile codebase and how it affects compile time</p></li><li><p>The shift from MVP to MVVM architecture</p></li><li><p>Why Reddit took a bet on Jetpack Compose (a declarative UI framework for Android, built in Kotlin), but decided (initially) against using SwiftUI (a declarative UI framework for iOS, built in Swift)</p></li><li><p>How automated testing evolved at Reddit</p></li><li><p>Reddit\u2019s approach to server-driven-mobile-UI</p></li><li><p>What the mobile platforms team looks for in a new engineering hire</p></li><li><p>Reddit\u2019s platform team\u2019s culture of experimentation and embracing failure</p></li><li><p>And much more!</p></li></ul><p>If you are interested in large-scale rewrites or native mobile engineering challenges: this episode is for you.</p><div id=\"youtube2-qDTW3EGnrkw\" class=\"youtube-wrap\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;qDTW3EGnrkw&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"Youtube2ToDOM\"><div class=\"youtube-inner\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qDTW3EGnrkw?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowautoplay=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"728\" height=\"409\"></iframe></div></div><h2>Takeaways</h2><p>My biggest takeaways from this episode:</p><p><strong>1.

The Reddit app is a lot more complex than one would assume. </strong>With around 200 native mobile engineers, Reddit has one of the largest mobile teams working on a single mobile codebase \u2013 I\u2019d be surprised if there were more than a dozen similarly large mobile teams focusing on a single, standalone app.</p><p>The app has about 20 feature teams working on different parts of it, and to give a taste of the complexity, the Android app has ~800 modules and 580 screens. <em>The complexity of mobile apps is rarely obvious at first glance \u2013 a few years ago, I did an explainer on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmeCYiD0hnE\">why the Uber app was hundreds of megabytes in size</a>.</em></p><p><strong>3. Poor developer experience can slow down a company \u2013 so pay attention! </strong>One of the reasons Reddit started investing heavily in modernizing its mobile stack was that the \u201cold stack\u201d was slowing down developers. Reddit\u2019s platform team got proof of this simply by asking native engineers about the biggest development-related challenges they face:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a9c68b9-7509-4f0e-b2a4-e451a4cd924d_1600x894.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a9c68b9-7509-4f0e-b2a4-e451a4cd924d_1600x894.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a9c68b9-7509-4f0e-b2a4-e451a4cd924d_1600x894.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a9c68b9-7509-4f0e-b2a4-e451a4cd924d_1600x894.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a9c68b9-7509-4f0e-b2a4-e451a4cd924d_1600x894.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a9c68b9-7509-4f0e-b2a4-e451a4cd924d_1600x894.png\" width=\"1456\" height=\"814\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2a9c68b9-7509-4f0e-b2a4-e451a4cd924d_1600x894.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:814,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a9c68b9-7509-4f0e-b2a4-e451a4cd924d_1600x894.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a9c68b9-7509-4f0e-b2a4-e451a4cd924d_1600x894.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a9c68b9-7509-4f0e-b2a4-e451a4cd924d_1600x894.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a9c68b9-7509-4f0e-b2a4-e451a4cd924d_1600x894.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">The most frequent challenges Reddit\u2019s mobile engineers used to have, as surveyed by their mobile platform team</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>4. GenAI coding tools feel like they are not \u201cthere\u201d yet with native mobile. </strong>LLMs integrated into IDEs seem to be increasingly helpful with backend, fullstack, web and even cross-platform (React Native / Expo) projects. However, Reddit\u2019s mobile team shared that they get a moderate boost from the Apple and Android Studio LLM additions.</p><p>Native mobile development is distinctively different from web, fullstack and backend coding \u2013 and it seems that these IDEs with AI functionality have not done much to optimize for the expereince of native mobile engineers. Over time, this will likely change \u2013 but it\u2019s a reminder that there are differences between fullstack, backend and native mobile development! (I wrote a book reflecting on more of the challenges unique to native mobile titled <a href=\"https://www.mobileatscale.com/\">Building Mobile Apps at Scale</a>)</p><h4><strong>An interesting quote from the episode</strong></h4><p>From <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qDTW3EGnrkw?si=J-KGZGW30b_ocNE-&amp;t=4151\">this part</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Gergely:</strong> \u201cWhat does it take for an iOS or Android engineer to work at a platform team like this? When you're hiring, what are the traits that you're looking for?\u201d</p><p><strong>Brandon</strong>: \u201cMy joke answer is that I don't know why someone would choose to do this [working on a platform team]. I just stumbled into it. It's very stressful and it's very hard. Having said that, I would not choose any other position.</p><p><strong>The most important thing for an IC who wants to get a job on a platform team: you need to sit in the consequences of your decisions.</strong> You should try to work at a tech company for a year or two and actually see what happens after you ship a system \u2014 and then the assumptions change! You then have to figure out how to keep this thing going. </p><p>Most things that I've had to write at Reddit are still in the code base (after 5+ years!). I wish they weren't, but you have to understand them.</p><p>You get a bunch of software design intuition because you have to like re-evaluate your assumptions for an incredibly long time. If you can do that, you're probably ready for platform stuff. </p><p>But take your time! Don\u2019t burn you out before you're ready. Cause this is hard.\u201d</p><p><strong>Lauren</strong>: \u201cBefriending your platform team is the best way to become a platform engineer someday. </p><p><strong>If you have a platform team, befriend them during hackathon weeks or get some mentorship within projects.</strong> Almost everyone has done something like that before they end up joining our team. But also we really like having really good partners on the feature teams themselves because they are very honest with us about what their real problems are and they are the best source of that.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Jump <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qDTW3EGnrkw?si=J-KGZGW30b_ocNE-&amp;t=4151\">this part of the episode.</a></p><h2><strong>The Pragmatic Engineer deepdives relevant for this episode</strong></h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/program-platform-split-uber\">The platform and program split at Uber</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/notion-going-native-on-ios-and-android\">Why and how Notion went native on iOS and Android</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/paying-down-tech-debt\">Paying down tech debt</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/cross-platform-mobile-development\">Cross-platform mobile development</a></p></li></ul><h2><strong>Timestamps</strong></h2><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw\">00:00</a>) Intro</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw&amp;t=124s\">02:04</a>) The scale of the Android code base</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw&amp;t=162s\">02:42</a>) The scale of the iOS code base</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw&amp;t=206s\">03:26</a>) What the compile time is for both Android and iOS</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw&amp;t=333s\">05:33</a>) The size of the mobile platform teams</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw&amp;t=540s\">09:00</a>) Why Reddit has so many mobile engineers</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw&amp;t=688s\">11:28</a>) The different types of testing done in the mobile platform</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw&amp;t=800s\">13:20</a>) The benefits and drawbacks of testing</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw&amp;t=1020s\">17:00</a>) How Eric, Brandon, and Lauren use AI in their workflows</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw&amp;t=1250s\">20:50</a>) Why Reddit grew its mobile teams in 2021</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw&amp;t=1610s\">26:50</a>) Reddit\u2019s modern tech stack, Corestack</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw&amp;t=1728s\">28:48</a>) Why Reddit shifted from MVP architecture to MVVM</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw&amp;t=1822s\">30:22</a>) The architecture on the iOS side</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw&amp;t=1928s\">32:08</a>) The new design system</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw&amp;t=1855s\">30:55</a>) The impact of migrating from REST to GraphQL</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw&amp;t=2300s\">38:20</a>) How the backend drove the GraphQL migration and why it was worth the pain</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw&amp;t=2597s\">43:17</a>) Why the iOS team is replacing SliceKit with SwiftUI</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw&amp;t=2888s\">48:08</a>) Why the Android team took a bet on Compose</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw&amp;t=3085s\">51:25</a>) How teams experiment with server-driven UI\u2014when it worked, and when it did not</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw&amp;t=3270s\">54:30</a>) Why server-driven UI isn\u2019t taking off, and why Lauren still thinks it could work</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw&amp;t=3565s\">59:25</a>) The ways that Reddit\u2019s modernization has paid off, both in DevX and UX</p><p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTW3EGnrkw&amp;t=4035s\">1:07:15</a>) The overall modernization philosophy;

        "body_html": "<p>Leaders can often find it hard to build deep trust and alignment with their teams, especially if those teams are quite big, or if the leader in question is quite senior. Doing regular skip-skip-skip levels is out of the question, attending every meeting is impossible, and the power dynamics of the org can make it hard for staff to really get to know you one-on-one.</p><p>You need a solution that works for you and your team, and allows the most efficient use of everyone's time, and is also archival, searchable, and shareable. The good news is that this solution already exists, and it predates slideshows, videos, and, come to think of it, even the internet.

I think about it as a <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mind_meld#:~:text=Noun,or%20plans%20between%20two%20people.\">mind meld</a>, which has the Wiktionary definition of:</p><blockquote><p>From the Star Trek franchise, where the term was first used in 1966 for a telepathic ability possessed by the alien race of Vulcans to share thoughts and feelings with another individual.</p></blockquote><p>It's how I continually open up my thoughts to the team with a long-term goal to reduce any mental alignment gap between us. I like to think that the more I share, the more they can understand what I believe is important and why, and the more that my style of working and thinking can propagate through the team.</p><p>There are a few rules and guidelines I follow when writing these mind melds. They should:</p><ul><li><p>Take no longer than 60 minutes to write.</p></li><li><p>Be no longer than 1,500 words.</p></li><li><p>Be sent out on a Friday afternoon as a way to close the week.</p></li><li><p>Have a conversational tone and high ease of reading, similar to how I write this newsletter.</p></li><li><p>Mix general updates with praise and feedback on things we can do better.</p></li><li><p>Be sent to the entire team in a way that anyone in the company can also read it.</p></li></ul><p>I will call out that because I have done a <a href=\"https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/book/\">ton of writing</a> and that English is my first language, I can write fairly quickly compared to other people who don't write as often. However, <a href=\"https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/qa/how-do-i-get-better-at-writing/\">writing is a skill that can be learned and improved over time</a>, so don't let that stop you from trying.</p><p>I'll spend the rest of the article going over my process for collecting the information I want to share, how I structure it, and then give you some hypothetical examples.</p><h2><strong>Collecting information</strong></h2><p>The first step is to continually collect information throughout the week. I wrote back in January about <a href=\"https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/growth/gather-decide-execute-reflecting-on-my-daily-system/\">my daily system</a> for how I capture notes and tasks using Logseq, but everyone uses something different.</p><p>The key is that you engage with your daily activities mindfully in a way that keeps your weekly update in mind. What I mean by this is that you are always on the lookout for:</p><ul><li><p>Direct experiences that you have had that would be valuable to share with the team. This could be anything from conversations with customers to shareable summaries of closed-door meetings such as executive reviews.</p></li><li><p>Events that can be celebrated, such as a big project shipping, a long-standing bug being resolved, or performance improvements that have been rolled out.</p></li><li><p>Things that could be improved, such as an incident that happened, an inefficient process that is causing friction, or data that highlights a problem that needs to be fixed (e.g. a drop in performance or an unexpected increase in infrastructure costs).</p></li><li><p>Events that are happening in the near future that you want to remind people about.</p></li></ul><p>For me, as I go about my week, I'll tag things in my notes with a <code>weekly-update</code> tag. This allows me to quickly search for them all later and use that as a starting point for my writing. I spend most of my week hammering out notes, so adding a tag is a super simple way to aggregate a week's worth of information on a Friday.</p><h2><strong>Structuring the mind meld</strong></h2><p>So, we get to Friday, and I've blocked out some time to write my update. I've got my tagged notes that I can use as a starting point, but we need some structure to the update.</p><p>Here's the rough structure that I hang my updates on:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Intro</strong>: A short paragraph that sets the tone for the update. Assuming nothing big and serious has happened, I keep it light and observational. For example, the other week I was in Helsinki for our exec committee meeting, so a paragraph about the trip and the meme around the Finnish weather was a good way to start.</p></li><li><p><strong>General updates</strong>: I batch together any general one-line updates that I want to share. This covers anything from welcome new hires, to upcoming events, to general company and engineering news. It's important stuff that doesn't need its own section.</p></li><li><p><strong>The main event</strong>: I'll pick one topic that I think is the most important thing to share. For example, if we are making a major change of some kind, this is where I'll go into detail about it. Similarly, if I've had a key observation that I think is worth exploring more deeply, this is it. In the following section, I'll cover some examples of what I mean by this. Typically I'll try to hang this on any key principles or values that I want to reinforce. The main event usually takes up the most space, maybe between 300-500 words.</p></li><li><p><strong>The sideshows</strong>: This is where I cover the other less important topics that I want to share, maybe a few hundred words each. This could be a summary of a recent incident, a shout out to a team or individual, or discussion around a process that we are trying to improve.</p></li><li><p><strong>The wrap up</strong>: I finish with a short paragraph that wraps up the update. This is usually a call to action such as asking for feedback or to share thoughts via comments or on Slack. If the tone of the update is light, I might share some interesting articles or podcasts that I found interesting during the week.</p></li></ul><p>As outlined before, I try to keep the entire update to around 1,500 words. This is a good length for people to read in one sitting, and I can hammer it out in one pass in around an hour.</p><p>Once I'm done and before I send it I'll also do a quick proof read to check for typos and grammar. I'll also then get an LLM to scrutinize it to see if there are ways that I can improve the content.</p><p>Here's an example of a prompt I might use:</p><pre><code><code>You are an expert editor. Please analyze the following draft of my weekly update that I sent as CTO to my department.\n\nFirst, conduct a thorough proofread for grammar, spelling, and clarity. Then, evaluate the content for completeness, conciseness, and strategic alignment with our company's goals.  Suggest specific revisions to improve the update's impact, including:\n\n- Identifying any missing information that should be included.\n- Rephrasing sentences for better clarity and flow.\n- Ensuring the update is concise and avoids unnecessary jargon.\n- Highlighting key achievements and their impact on the company's objectives.\n- Suggesting ways to make the update more engaging for the intended audience (e.g., using visuals, summarizing key takeaways).\n- Applying 'Chain of Thought' prompting, break down complex updates into step-by-step reasoning for clarity.\n- If applicable, use 'Tree of Thoughts' to explore alternative ways to frame certain updates for maximum impact.\n\nHere is the draft of my weekly update:\n\n[insert draft here]\n</code></code></pre><p>If you're looking for help with generating prompts for you that are this detailed, then a neat trick that you can use is to take the PDF whitepaper on <a href=\"https://www.gptaiflow.tech/assets/files/2025-01-18-pdf-1-TechAI-Goolge-whitepaper_Prompt%20Engineering_v4-af36dcc7a49bb7269a58b1c9b89a8ae1.pdf\">Prompt Engineering</a> as input to your own GPT or Gemini Gem, and then create a reusable tool that utilizes it to improve the input prompt that you give it.</p><p>For example, the prompt text for your reusable tool using the whitepaper to generate prompts could be:</p><pre><code><code>You are a tool to generate excellent prompts that will greatly improve output compared to what is given as input. You will use the attached book on Prompt Engineering to formulate these prompts and you will return the improved prompt along with your reasoning for why it is better.\n\nYou are always helping a CTO do their job, so frame the prompts as such.\n</code></code></pre><p>I find myself using this trick all the time now, and it works really well. I don't copy the output verbatim because I like to keep my own writing style and voice, but it does help me make a number of edits and improvements to the text.</p><h2><strong>An example mind meld</strong></h2><p>Instructions aside, it's probably best to just show you an example of a weekly mind meld. Here's a hypothetical one following the structure above. I've made it up, but it should give you a good idea of what I mean.</p><h3><strong>The April 2025 mind meld</strong></h3><p>Hey team,</p><p>I'm back home after spending a week visiting our London office. It was nice to spend a few days away from the screen and get to spend time with many of you who I don't get to see as often. I even managed to get out for a couple of evening walks in the unusually warm weather.</p><p>There are a few short updates that are worth sharing before we go any further:</p><ul><li><p>A huge welcome to our five (!) new starters this week: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave, and Eve. It's great to have you here with us, and as you get your dev environments set up, please DM me if you have any issues: we've put a lot of effort into improving cold starts recently, but I know there can still be some hiccups which we will continue to work on.</p></li><li><p>Congratulations to the infrastructure team for completing the migration of our final legacy database. We are now 100% on our new database platform which is not only faster, but also so much cheaper and scalable.</p></li><li><p>A reminder that we have our quarterly all hands next week. The invite is in your calendar and you can submit Q&amp;A via the link in the invite.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Speed of decision making</strong></h4><p>There is an important topic that I wanted to cover this week: speed of decision making. We've been growing a lot recently and as we do, we need to be hyper-aware about our rate of progress.</p><p>As I talked to many of you in person, the main complaint that I heard was that we are moving too slowly. This wasn't just in one area, but across all teams and projects. I think this is a symptom of our growth, and it's something that we need to address as a team.</p><p>Here's something that I would like us all to try: if you are blocked on progress in any way, shape or form, and it has been more than 24 hours, please escalate it to me. I will then work with you to unblock it. This could be anything from a decision that needs to be made, to a resource that you need, or even just a conversation that you need to have with someone.</p><p>This might seem like an unscalable solution, but I want to make it super clear that we cannot afford to slow down at this stage of our growth. The longer we take to make decisions, the more ground that our competitors will gain on us. As such, I will be prioritizing any escalation that I receive, and I will work with you to get it resolved as quickly as possible.</p><p>Honestly, nothing is too small. Just DM me and we will fix it. Trust me.</p><h4><strong>Incident response</strong></h4><p>I wanted to bring attention to the new process that we are starting around incident response. We've been working hard to improve our incident response process, and I think we are finally getting to a place where we can start to see some real improvements.</p><p>We have implemented new rotas, new tools, and new processes to help us respond to incidents faster and more effectively. I know that this is a big change for many of you since we have dramatically expanded our on-call rota, but I think it is a necessary step to take. For far too long we have been relying on a small number of people to respond to incidents, and this has led to burnout and frustration.</p><p>I want to thank everyone who was involved in turning around the incident that happened earlier this week. I was scrolling through the Slack messages and I was impressed by the organization, communication, and speed of response from many of you who hadn't done this before. The RCA that was done the following day was also very insightful, and we're already getting to work on the action items that were raised.</p><p>Let's keep at this and build our muscles in this area.</p><h4><strong>Thoughts for the weekend</strong></h4><p>I'm aware that there is a public holiday coming up in the UK, so a number of us have an extra day off. If you get a bit of free time, here are some cool things to check out:</p><ul><li><p>Have a play with the latest Gemini model, 2.5 Flash. I've been very impressed by Google's latest models, and if you've only been using ChatGPT for a while, you might be surprised by how Gemini compares.</p></li><li><p>I really enjoyed the latest Acquired podcast on <a href=\"https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/epic-systems-mychart\">Epic Systems</a>. If you're outside of the US, you might not have heard of them, but they are an impressive and <em>curious</em> company \u2014 just search for pictures of their campus in Wisconsin.</p></li><li><p>And lastly, if you really just want to get away from the screen and do nothing for three days, that is totally fine too.</p></li></ul><p>Have a great weekend.</p><h2><strong>And that's a wrap</strong></h2><p>I've been enjoying writing weekly to my team so far. Even though writing isn't video or audio, I still think it's the most scalable way to communicate with a large team, and one that allows me to keep pushing forward on the things that I believe are important, whilst keeping the team aligned and informed.</p><p>I hope this article has given you some ideas on how to do the same. I'd love to hear how you communicate with your own teams.</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://theengineeringmanager.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication.

AI is the new data is the new cloud.</p></li><li><p>Echoes in the industry that we are all now overstaffed as a result of productivity gains: that everyone should do more with less, and that AI is the answer to that.</p></li></ul><p>Note: this article is not a technical overview of how to <em>build products</em> with LLMs. Instead, the intent is to touch upon what leadership should do from the perspective of the productivity of teams and organizations, and consequently how we should think about spending our budgets to make that happen. There are plenty of hot takes out there on AI. This is not intended to be one of them.</p><p>What we'll cover related to LLMs is:</p><ul><li><p>The (real) rising floor of developer productivity.</p></li><li><p>The changing size of organizations.</p></li><li><p>The increasing importance of code reviews.</p></li><li><p>The changing nature of interviews and identifying talent in short spaces of time.</p></li></ul><p>The intent is that this should provoke thought and discussion, and will hopefully help you think about how to allocate your budget and focus in the coming months and years.</p><h2><strong>The floor is rising</strong></h2><p>With <a href=\"https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/jnCFrNexNQnngZkAGBvzv\">Copilot</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cursor.com/\">Cursor</a>, <a href=\"https://cline.bot/\">Cline</a> and other LLM-based developer tools, the floor of developer productivity is rising.</p><p>At the time of writing in 2025, I believe even the most AI-skeptical developers are now seeing the <em>insane </em>productivity gains that LLMs can provide. Yes, it was true that, several years ago, the promise and the hype <em>far</em> outweighed the consistent proof of benefits, but in a post <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gpt-4/\">GPT-4</a> world, LLMs have become an integral part of the developer's toolkit, even if it is just for fast research or rubber ducking rather than agentic pair programming.</p><p>I don't know many developers that would give them up now, myself included. I go too fast with them to go back to the old way of doing things.</p><p>If for some reason (!) you haven't fully leaned into LLM-assisted coding yet, the benefits are plentiful:</p><ul><li><p>LLMs are <em>fantastic</em> for getting over the cold start problem of a new idea. You can go from nothing to a throwaway prototype in no time at all, starting with a vague prompt of what you want and iterating on it. There are numerous \"vibe coding\" projects that are generating some <a href=\"https://x.com/levelsio/status/1897081230467686810?s=46\">serious revenue</a>.</p></li><li><p>You can use a prompt to sketch out whole architecture ideas with back of the envelope calculations and tradeoffs.</p></li><li><p>Copilot-style autocompletion is now <em>very</em> good unlocks the next step in your thought process.</p></li><li><p>Agent-based tools like Cursor or Copilot Chat, when kept under control, can be a great way to get a lot of boilerplate code written quickly.</p></li><li><p>Writing tests, and therefore driving up code coverage, is now much easier. LLMs can write tests for you, and agent-based tools can execute the red-green cycle for you as you go.</p></li></ul><p>If you haven't yet spent an afternoon or evening with Cursor, then please, please, please make time and see how fast you can go from a blank page to a fully functioning hobby project. It is <em>incredible</em> how fast you can go from nothing to something.</p><p>So in terms of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle\">Gartner hype cycle J-curve</a>, we are clearly on the upward slope towards enlightenment. The tools are getting better, and they are getting better <em>fast</em>. It is unclear as to how far the <a href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\">Bitter Lesson</a> will take us, and predictions currently range from being on the cusp of hitting a plateau of productivity to full-blown AGI, but it <em>is</em> clear that an organization that does not embrace LLMs will be left behind by their competitors.</p><p>As an operator, up-skilling your team to use these tools is now <em>essential</em>. Securing the necessary budget to give everyone access to the Pro tiers of ChatGPT, Cursor, or whatever tools represent the best fit for your team is a table stakes activity. And yes, this does mean that your budget will increase, but the productivity gains from an existing team will more than make up for it. Trade the cost of hiring new people for the cost of acquiring tooling.</p><p>You should also take the <em>adoption</em> of this tooling seriously. It is not just a case of giving everyone subscriptions and hoping for the best. You need to invest time and effort into training your team on how to use these tools effectively.</p><ul><li><p>Run a survey to see what tools your team is already using and how they are using them. As part of the survey, identify which of your engineers are already fully ingrained in the new LLM workflows and which are not.</p></li><li><p>Identify champions based on the previous point and have them run training sessions and also overindex on pair programming with those who are less familiar (or more skeptical) of the tools.</p></li><li><p>Promote a culture of sharing best practices and tips for using LLMs. Get your champions to lean in and share their workflows and processes with the rest of the team. Videos work wonders here.</p></li><li><p>Track the usage of AI tools over time as you adopt them. For example, Cursor offers team analytics, and you can see how many lines of code are being generated and accepted. Use this as part of the feedback loop to see how your team is progressing. Is usage increasing or decreasing? Why?</p></li><li><p>Cross-reference the usage data with other metrics you are collecting. For example, how is the average number of commits to the codebase changing as tool usage increases? What about the number of incidents or reported bugs? What's happening with your DORA metrics as a result?</p></li></ul><p>Focus on showing that the tools are making a real difference, and this too can be motivation to bring the most skeptical engineers on board.</p><h2><strong>Organization sizes are changing</strong></h2><p>Given that the way that we create software has changed, there is another operator's consideration: the <em>size</em> of your organization.</p><p>Layoffs have been rife since the end of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_interest-rate_policy\">ZIRP</a>. Overlapping this period has been the rise of LLMs, and in some cases, the two have been conflated: organizations haven't <em>just</em> shrunk because of AI efficiency gains, but they also haven't <em>just</em> shrunk because of the macroeconomic environment either; the two are becoming somewhat intertwined, if you believe what these companies are saying.</p><p>However, it is true that from a company-operator's perspective, the hard-to-exactly-quantify, but definitely <em>real</em>, productivity gains from LLMs allow you the ability to do more with less.</p><p>And amongst a tricky economic environment, instead of staying same-sized and increasing output, there has been a trend in many organizations to reduce headcount and combine this with AI tooling to (sort of) <em>maintain</em> the same level of output.</p><p>If you think about it, many of the world's largest companies are (or <em>were</em>) staffed to pre-LLM productivity levels off of the back of ZIRP, and you could argue that there consequently has been an exchange of a large chunk of money that used to pay salaries for a smaller chunk of money that pays for tokens and subscriptions.</p><p>One could even argue, especially at large companies, that if all developers could go, let's say, twice as fast with the new tooling, then other bottlenecks would appear that would limit the speed of progress anyway, so less really is more.</p><p>These bottlenecks may already exist: the sometimes glacial speed of making decisions, the amount of change and new features that your users can stomach at once, the time it takes to go through cycles of shipping and <em>learning</em> and iterating and so on.</p><p>Many companies are already at the point where they effectively block the speed of their own progress in other ways than just the number of developers they have. Making those developers faster may not actually help them ship more features, and in fact, it may make things worse.</p><p>Maybe you work for a company like this.</p><p>Going back to the operator's perspective, if you currently work for a <em>small</em> or <em>medium</em>-sized company, a good idea would be to focus your attention on giving everyone access to the right tools and training to become more productive <em>before</em> you go on another hiring spree. Get everyone coding like they should be coding in 2025 first, assess and prove the productivity gains, get your tooling in place, and <em>then</em> look at hiring more people.</p><p>And remember that tooling goes beyond developers: we're talking about <em>all</em> employees. A pro subscription to ChatGPT is just as useful for a marketer's efficiency as it is for a developer. Giving each employee in a 50-person company a ChatGPT Pro subscription is still cheaper than hiring a senior developer or two. Think about macro efficiency gains across the whole organization, not just in engineering.</p><h2><strong>Reviews are more important than ever</strong></h2><p>The flip side of the productivity gains is that more code is being written, and, most importantly, not all of it has been as carefully thought through as handcrafted code.</p><p>If you've used Cursor without specifically asking the prompt to slow down, go step-by-step and ask for your input frequently, you've likely seen it go off and blast out hundreds of lines of code that is hard to keep track of.</p><p>Now, this is <em>great</em> for getting a prototype up and running, but it is not so great for production code: the code generation starts to go faster than you can meaningfully comprehend it as a human, and bugs can be introduced that are hard to spot. In the best case, the code can be messy or unoptimized. In the worst case, it can be full of security holes that could seriously compromise your organization.</p><p>As such, with the faster production of code, as an operator it is more important than <em>ever</em> to ensure you have a strong review process in place: if your most senior engineers were getting a half-arsed rubber stamp thumbs up from their peers (not advised, but it happens), now you need to ensure that <em>all</em> code is being scrutinized as the origins of it are less clear.</p><p>You could:</p><ul><li><p>Make it clear to your organization that even though LLMs can generate lots of code almost instantly, human reviewers can only digest <em>so</em> much. Keep PRs small, commits clear, and code easy to read.</p></li><li><p>Increase the number of required reviewers on your PRs. For example, go from one reviewer to two. You could also have engineers flag their own PRs that have heavy LLM usage to call out that they need extra scrutiny.</p></li><li><p>Give people a refresher on security best practices (shock horror!) so they can be better aware of when LLMs are generating code that is insecure.</p></li><li><p>Make improvements in your incident postmortem process to ensure that you are learning from your mistakes. Share any production issues that stemmed from overlooked generated code widely across the organization so that everyone can learn from them.</p></li><li><p>Investigate AI tools such as <a href=\"https://snyk.io/platform/deepcode-ai/\">DeepCode by Snyk</a> or <a href=\"https://diamond.graphite.dev/\">Graphite's Diamond</a> that could help detect issues in code before it is even reviewed by a human.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Am I even interviewing you? Or your LLM?</strong></h2><p>The typical tech interview process for individual contributors, which involves some combination of coding challenges, white boarding, and system design, has had another curve ball thrown at it by LLMs.</p><p>When interviewing remotely, we may have previously been concerned about candidates using a search engine to look up answers, but now we have to consider that they might be side-channeling all of the questions to an LLM.</p><p>If you are an interviewer, how can you tell that off to the side of the Google Meet window is another browser window with a prompt open? By the time you have described the system design specification, the candidate could have easily typed it into the prompt and have gotten an incredibly detailed and plausible answer back.</p><p>And hey, don't just take my word for it, try it: open Grok and type \"I am doing a system design interview. Help me with it. I have to design Instagram from scratch. Give me back of the envelope calculations and follow the structure of the ByteByteGo book.\"</p><p>Scary, huh?</p><p>If your candidates are good at placing their windows on the screen in the right places and keeping their eye movement under control, you might not even notice that they are doing it. How are we meant to get good signal from candidates now that we can't figure out if we're talking to them or a prompt?</p><p>If you want to test a candidate completely without LLM assistance, you could ask them to share their entire screen so you can see what is going on. However, this feels invasive. Alternatively, a lighter touch version is to have the interviewer share <em>their</em> screen and problems are tackled together via pair programming and high bandwidth conversation where it would be hard for the candidate to be typing away into a prompt and then trying to pass off the answer as their own.</p><p>Alternatively, you could go in the complete opposite direction: <em>accept</em> that LLMs are now part of the job, and like the rest of the article, <em>embrace them</em>.</p><p>For example, if you want to hire people that can tackle large and ambiguous problems quickly with LLMs, get them to demonstrate these skills in the interview. This is similar to exams at school that are open book: you can use whatever resources you want, but you have to demonstrate that you know how to use them and that you can think critically about the answers that they give you.</p><p>The choice is yours as an interviewer: either allow LLMs or don't, but <em>be explicit about it ahead of the interview so that the candidate knows what to expect</em>. If you do allow LLMs, you should also be clear about the rules of conduct in the interview: are they allowed to use them for everything? Are they allowed to use them for some things? What are the boundaries? Don't make them guess.</p><p>Regardless of which way you go, you'll need to adapt your interview process to ensure that you are getting the right signal.</p><ul><li><p>Having candidates seek solutions to leetcode problems is <em>not</em> going to work. LLMs can easily dump code for doubly linked lists and binary trees, and annotate the answers with all of the big-O complexities attached.</p></li><li><p>Instead, questions that you ask should be sufficiently ambiguous that part of the interview is figuring out the specific <em>requirements</em> of the problem and what the code or system should do. Doing this in a conversational manner is a great way to see how the candidate thinks, and if you've not allowed LLMs to be used, it should be obvious through long periods of silence if they're trying to bend the rules.</p></li><li><p>Spot-test their knowledge: the interviewer should be able to interrogate components of the candidate's solution as they go along, asking questions about the design and implementation that highlight whether the candidate <em>actually</em> has knowledge here, or at least is able to think about their solution critically and from first principles. For example, if they think a cache should be implemented, ask them why, and what the tradeoffs are. Ask for some examples of caches they have used before and how they worked. Pick a point in the solution and go fully down the rabbit hole with them. Think latency, throughput, and failure modes. Answers should be fairly instantaneous if they know their stuff.</p></li><li><p>If candidates come to a solution quickly, see if there are alternative ways in which they could have approached the problem. For experienced engineers, it should be possible to have a conversation about the tradeoffs of different approaches to the one they have taken. If they've used a batch processing system, ask about how a streaming system could look. If they've written code that is synchronous, ask them how they would make it asynchronous, and so on. Probe deeper.</p></li><li><p>Use methods of collaboration that LLMs are <em>not</em> good at. For example, a shared whiteboard is a great way to think about problems together, interactively, proving that you are really working together with the candidate in the same way that you would if they were a new hire.</p></li></ul><p>Design your interview process to find the kinds of candidates that you really want to work with. If you're looking for people that are great at using LLMs, then have your interview process find these people. Be open about it.</p><p>If instead you value candidates that are great at coding or design solutions unassisted despite the tools we all now have available, that's also fine, but be open about that too. Let them know way ahead of time that this is how it's going to be. You can't have it both ways, and you need to design your process accordingly to get the right signal.</p><h2><strong>And that's a wrap</strong></h2><p>If you haven't already, you need to start bringing your team(s) into the present day. Software development isn't just changing, it <em>has</em> changed, and if you haven't been adapting already, you're getting left behind. This isn't just important for your company, but it's also incredibly important for your employees: you owe them access to the best tools available to do their jobs.</p><p>Happy prompting.</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://theengineeringmanager.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication.

I skim PRs but don\u2019t critically review them and don\u2019t write code. Should EMs write code in their day job?</p><p>Thanks!</p></blockquote><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://theengineeringmanager.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.</p></div><form class=\"subscription-widget-subscribe\"><input type=\"email\" class=\"email-input\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Type your email\u2026\" tabindex=\"-1\"><input type=\"submit\" class=\"button primary\" value=\"Subscribe\"><div class=\"fake-input-wrapper\"><div class=\"fake-input\"></div><div class=\"fake-button\"></div></div></form></div></div><p>It's a great question, and given the higher scrutiny we've seen on the role of engineering managers in the past few years, it's worth spending some time on it.</p><p>Before we go any deeper, the short answer is that it depends exactly on what you mean by coding. I think that there is a big difference between being <em>in</em> the code and <em>writing</em> code. All managers should be in the code, but not all managers should be writing code.</p><p>But spending some time digging into the nuances of the question can, I think, highlight both the practical aspects of ensuring that managers are sufficiently <em>in</em> the code, and, more importantly, identify the existential worry that many engineering managers may have about their role, and what they can do about it.</p><p>Let's get going.</p><h2><strong>Refresher: measuring your impact</strong></h2><p>We'll begin by revisiting Andy Grove's equation for measuring a manager's impact, which states that <em>the output of a manager is the output of their team, plus the output of the neighboring teams under their influence</em>. This is always useful to refer to when thinking about how to spend your time. I contemplate it a lot.</p><p>There are, of course, a multitude of ways to increase your output as a manager. These range from, and are not limited to:</p><ul><li><p>Hiring and retaining great people.</p></li><li><p>Owning the team's strategy and roadmap, and ensuring efficient execution.</p></li><li><p>Making decisions to ensure that the team is working on the right things and saying no to the things that don't matter.</p></li><li><p>Dealing with fires, escalations, and other crises that pop up all of the time.</p></li><li><p>Building a strong culture within the team so that people are engaged, challenged, and motivated.</p></li><li><p>Mentoring and coaching your reports so they get better and can have more work delegated to them, thus increasing output further.</p></li><li><p>Managing the team's stakeholders so they can offer their steer to the team early and often.</p></li><li><p>Actively performance managing the team so that superstars can continue to shine and underperformers can be coached or exited.</p></li><li><p>Building close working relationships with other teams so that smooth collaboration happens across the organization, leading to a better and more cohesive product.</p></li></ul><p>And so on.</p><p>Now, it isn't a stretch to say that engineering managers, who typically get to a senior individual contributor level before transitioning to management, are <em>also</em> often very good at writing code.</p><p>However, there's a whole <em>team</em> of people working for them who are <em>also</em> very good at writing code, and typically they won't be spending as much time on the items listed above, which means they can be more productive at writing code than the manager can.</p><p>So, therefore, surely it makes sense for managers to focus on the things that <em>only they can do</em>, and leave the coding to the people who have more time for it and are better at it as a result?</p><p>Right?</p><p>Or is there something else at play here?</p><h2><strong>2025 cultural backdrop</strong></h2><p>The last few years have created somewhat of an existential crisis for engineering managers.</p><p>Since the tail end of the Covid-19 pandemic, where the <a href=\"https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/growth/2024-year-in-review/\">zero-percent interest rate environment ended</a>, leading to high inflation and interest rates, the end of cheap debt and plentiful investment, and the consequential slowdown in growth and corrective layoffs at many technology companies, managers have <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/middle-manager-hiring-white-collar-recession-layoffs-jobs-efficiency-2024-12\">felt the brunt of the \"great flattening\"</a>, where the number of managers has been reduced in favor of more individual contributors.</p><p>This has typically meant that the average number of direct reports per manager has increased, the amount of scope per manager has increased too, and the number of total layers in the org chart has shrunk.</p><p>This, therefore, feeds into a narrative that managers worth their salt need to be more productive, more impactful, and more efficient than before.</p><p>Depending on where you read your opinions on the internet, It can also build a more toxic picture: that managers are just unnecessary overhead for having some number of individual contributors; that it is a non-technical job for those that aren't as good as others at actually building the product.</p><p>Hmm.</p><p>For those that made a conscious decision to move into management and learn this new role, and especially for those who take their craft <em>seriously</em> as managers, it can feel like the tide has turned against them.</p><p>As such, engineering managers, and the organizations that they work for, are pushing for ways for managers to differentiate themselves, typically by being more technical, more hands-on, and more in the details than they may have been before.</p><p>This isn't a bad thing. When done right, it can be extremely beneficial. I wrote extensively about <a href=\"https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/being-in-the-details/\">being in the details</a> from a senior leadership perspective.</p><p>I would argue that being in the details is the key tenet of not just being a great manager in the climate that we find ourselves in, but also being a great manager <em>full stop</em>.</p><p>For senior leaders such as Directors and VPs, being in the details covers ideas such as having ICs report to you, as well as managers; doing regular, hands-on deep dives into the architecture and codebases your team owns; mixing up 1:1s with pair programming sessions, code reviews, and other technical activities, and more.</p><p>But what does this mean for frontline engineering managers? Is the new normal just about writing more code and doing less of the other things that peacetime managers would normally do?</p><h2><strong>Writing code versus being in the code</strong></h2><p>It's more nuanced than that.</p><p>Here is a list of statements that represent how I would want my engineering managers to be in terms of their relationship with the codebase:</p><ul><li><p>Should they be <em>able</em> to write code? Yes.</p></li><li><p>Should they understand how the codebase and their features and services are built? Yes.</p></li><li><p>Should they be able to do code reviews? Yes.</p></li><li><p>Should they review all design documents and architecture proposals from their team? Yes.</p></li><li><p>Should they be able to debug and triage production issues? Yes.</p></li><li><p>Should they be able to pair program with their reports? Yes.</p></li><li><p>Should they be accountable for the quality of the code that their team produces? Yes.</p></li><li><p>Should they write code themselves? <em>Maybe.</em></p></li></ul><p>Why maybe?</p><p>It depends on the manager, the team, and the organization. As a senior leader, I would rather my managers be <em>in</em> the code as per the above list, but not necessarily putting themselves in the critical path by <em>writing</em> code, given that they are likely to be interrupted more often, have more meetings, and be pulled in more directions than their reports.</p><p>I expect you to know how everything works, insofar that if I asked you to show me how a feature works by tracing through the code, you could do it. However, I would also know that there are other people on the team that are better placed to be the primary implementers of features in the area that you understand really well.</p><p>But, if you are a manager that is absolutely <em>itching</em> to write code and stay close to the details, then so be it and more power to you.</p><p>Here's some approaches that might work for you:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Explicitly set aside uninterrupted time for coding.</strong> This could be a day a week, or a few hours a day, or whatever works for your team. Make sure that your team knows that you are doing this, to keep interruptions to a minimum. Block it out in your calendar, and set your statuses accordingly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pair program with your reports.</strong> This is a great way to get into the code, and also to mentor your reports at the same time. It's a win-win. Sure, you're not taking the lead on the coding yourself, but you're in the details by proxy of collaborating with others. I love doing this myself.</p></li><li><p><strong>Do code reviews.</strong> Don't just skim PRs (sorry, reader!), but really dig into them: run the branch locally, test it, think critically about the design and the implementation, and provide feedback. Record a video of your review to highlight things that could be better.</p></li><li><p><strong>Increase your coding involvement during specific occasions.</strong> Depending on how you and your team work, you may find that prototyping phases are where you can get your hands dirty effectively. That code isn't going into production, so go to town! Alternatively, you might be great at digging in during incidents or times of high stress. Find the times that work for you and your team, and lean into them. This approach isn't about spending a consistent amount of time coding every week; it's about finding the <em>right</em> times to be in the code where you can be most effective.</p></li><li><p><strong>Find time for exploratory coding that expands the knowledge of your team.</strong> Block out some regular time to stay on top of the latest technologies in a way that is fun and engaging for you, sharpens your skills, but also brings back learnings to your team. For example, if your team uses Apache Flink and the latest version has new aggregation functionality that could make your pipelines simpler, spend a couple of hours doing a prototype with it for a team-specific use case and then share it back.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>And finally...</strong></h2><p>Going back to the original question: should managers write code? I think it's best to rephrase that.</p><p>Should managers be <em>in</em> the code? Yes, absolutely.</p><p>Should managers <em>write</em> code? Maybe, but it also depends on what you mean by writing code.</p><p>If you mean being the primary implementer of features, then probably not. If you mean being an integral part of how your team produces code, then yes, absolutely. I recommend it highly.</p><p>So there we are.</p><p>I enjoyed doing this month's article as a mailbag question. If you ever have a question that you think would make a good article, please send it in! I'd love to hear from you, and I'll try my best to answer it.</p><p>Happy coding (in some form), managers.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://theengineeringmanager.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://theengineeringmanager.substack.com/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>",

        "body_html": "<p>Since my November article on <a href=\"https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/being-in-the-details/\">being in the details</a>, I've had a few people ask me about the system that I use in order to do so. In my <a href=\"https://pragprog.com/titles/jsengman/become-an-effective-software-engineering-manager/\">first book</a> I went into great detail about how I manage information and stay organized. On reflection, my approach has evolved since then, so I thought it would be a good time to revisit the topic.</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://theengineeringmanager.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication.

Therefore it should reflect how you work and how your company works, and produce the outputs that you need to be effective in your role.</p><p>This, of course, means that what works for me might not work for you, and vice versa, and that's OK. The key is to have a system that you trust and that you use consistently to get the outcomes that you need.</p><p>At the time of writing, I'm in an engineering leadership position at Shopify, which is a fully remote company with a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-02-14/how-shopify-cut-320-000-hours-of-unnecessary-meetings\">culture of minimal meetings and a preference for asynchronous communication</a>. This clearly has an impact on how I work and how I manage information, especially when compared to my previous roles at companies with an office-based culture.</p><p>For example, I now no longer need to keep a notepad handy to jot down things as I'm walking around the office (I'm at home), nor do I get to exercise my preference of using wonderful, searchable, archivable email as my primary communication tool (everyone uses Slack instead; you can't win them all).</p><p>Although my approach has evolved over the last few years, the fundamentals remain the same:</p><ul><li><p>Management of large organizations can quickly become overwhelming and messy if you don't have some way of managing the information that you need to keep track of.</p></li><li><p>Your memory does not have a large enough working set to reliably keep track of all the information that you should have close to hand. If you think it is, you're likely unaware of the things that you're forgetting.</p></li><li><p>No matter how good the tools are that your company provides, having your <em>own</em> system that you trust and have complete ownership of is essential: it won't disappear one day because the company decided to switch to a different tool.</p></li><li><p>The system that you use should be simple and easy to use, otherwise you won't use it.</p></li><li><p>The system should also be flexible enough to adapt to your needs as they change. If one busy day blows your system out of the water and you become ineffective, then it's not a good system in the first place.</p></li></ul><p>This article will be about more than just the software tool that I use, even though it is central to it. Instead, I'll focus on the way using this tool allows me to categorize the way that I work into tight loops of <em>gathering, deciding, and executing</em>. This is a mental model that I've found to be very effective in managing my day-to-day work, and enables me to keep the pace high for myself and my team.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e3dd794-a5ba-4578-b316-52b70d6ac69c_2000x1942.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e3dd794-a5ba-4578-b316-52b70d6ac69c_2000x1942.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e3dd794-a5ba-4578-b316-52b70d6ac69c_2000x1942.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e3dd794-a5ba-4578-b316-52b70d6ac69c_2000x1942.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e3dd794-a5ba-4578-b316-52b70d6ac69c_2000x1942.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e3dd794-a5ba-4578-b316-52b70d6ac69c_2000x1942.jpeg\" width=\"1456\" height=\"1414\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0e3dd794-a5ba-4578-b316-52b70d6ac69c_2000x1942.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1414,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2012213,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e3dd794-a5ba-4578-b316-52b70d6ac69c_2000x1942.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e3dd794-a5ba-4578-b316-52b70d6ac69c_2000x1942.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e3dd794-a5ba-4578-b316-52b70d6ac69c_2000x1942.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e3dd794-a5ba-4578-b316-52b70d6ac69c_2000x1942.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">A gather-decide-execute loop.</figcaption></figure></div><p>This gather-decide-execute loop that I run has some similarities to other loops that exist in the world of strategy, such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop\">OODA loop</a>. Similarly, good technology companies are ones that move through the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup#Build%E2%80%93Measure%E2%80%93Learn\">build-measure-learn</a> loop faster than their competitors. I'm trying to do the same thing, but with the information that I need to run my organization effectively.</p><h2><strong>Gathering: the inputs to your system</strong></h2><p>We'll begin with the always-on process of gathering information. There's a couple of maxims I find useful here:</p><ul><li><p>There's a difference between <em>information</em> and <em>knowledge</em>. Information is raw data, while knowledge is information that has been processed and <em>understood</em>. I aim to build up a store of knowledge that I can use to make decisions, and this is done through active note-taking.</p></li><li><p>Gathering information is an active and ongoing process. It's not about letting things come to you, but instead, it's about <a href=\"https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/being-in-the-details/\">being in the details</a> and <em>actively seeking out</em> the information that you need to do be effective. I pull on threads and I ask questions to learn more about the things that I need to know.</p></li></ul><p>The main change in my approach in recent years is that I am now a heavy user of <a href=\"https://logseq.com/\">Logseq</a> as my primary tool for both note-taking and task management. If you've not used second-brain software like Logseq, <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> or <a href=\"https://roamresearch.com/\">Roam Research</a> before, it's a bit like having a personal wiki that you can use to store all of your notes and tasks in a way that is easily searchable and linkable.</p><p>For example, you can reference pages in your notes like <code>[[this]] </code>and Logseq will automatically create a link to that page (and create it if it doesn't exist), generating a network of information that you can navigate. Each page shows backlinks, so you can see all the other pages that reference it, and you can also see a graph view of all the pages and how they link together.</p><p>If you've not tried one of these tools, give them a go. They're free.</p><p>I consider myself to be in gather mode all of the time. My job, like many others, involves being subject to a firehose of information via email, Slack, project management software, and (minimal) meetings. </p><p>The way that I approach this is that I always have my Logseq window open on the right-hand side of my screen (by typing <code>last fourth</code> in <a href=\"https://www.raycast.com/\">Raycast</a>), and I try to capture anything important that comes my way as soon as I see it. Similar to revising for an exam, the act of summarizing what I'm seeing and writing it down helps me to remember it better, even without searching for it.</p><p>I have a few key flows that I use to organize my notes:</p><ul><li><p>Logseq defaults to a daily journal page, which results in a new page being created for each day. I use this for freeform notes that I may never read again, but that I want to capture in the moment. This is more about the habit of note-taking for memorization than it is about creating a useful artifact.</p></li><li><p>For things that I need to do, the neat thing about Logseq is that you can create <code>TODO</code> items that render with a checkbox. You can search for all of your <code>TODO</code> items across all of your notes for an adhoc task list, or even better, you can schedule them to appear later on a specific day (try <code>/schedule</code> to bring up the date picker, where you can also create repeating tasks).</p></li><li><p>For more permanent notes, I have a page for my team and sub-teams, where I keep long-lived references to key dashboards, links to key documents like roadmaps, sub-pages for notable projects, and so on. This is the kind of information that I want to be able to find quickly, and that I want to be able to link to from other notes.</p></li><li><p>I also use hashtags to categorize some of my notes for summarization later. A great use case for this was shown to me by my colleague <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/victorv-software/\">Victor</a> who uses a <code>#highlight</code> tag to generate weekly <a href=\"https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/\">brag docs</a> for his manager. You could use tagging for specific notes about particular projects (e.g. <code>#widgetupgrade</code>), or links to articles or papers you may want to browse later without saturating your to-do list (e.g. <code>#toread</code>), or making it easy to send out a weekly update to your team with things you've observed.</p></li></ul><p>Aside from tools, I also have a few habits and behaviors that help me to gather information effectively:</p><ul><li><p>When interacting with others about a new or complex topic, I tend to summarize what I've heard back to them in my own words to make sure that I've understood it correctly. For example, \"So what you're saying is that we need to do X, Y, and Z in order to achieve A, B, and C?\" Not only does this help me to understand the topic better, but it also can highlight where there are misunderstandings or gaps in what is being communicated. I'll then capture this summary in my notes.</p></li><li><p>I try to fight against a natural reduction in skepticism over time. When you're new to a topic or a team you're more likely to ask questions and challenge assumptions, but over time you can become more complacent. I've learned that not only does a healthy dose of skepticism help to keep you sharp, but it also helps to keep your team sharp too. If you're always asking questions, then your team will be more likely to do the same. You can even ask these questions of yourself in your notes to keep exercising that muscle.</p></li><li><p>I heavily use LLMs to expand my knowledge of topics as I read about them, and to act as a managerial rubber duck when I'm trying to work through a problem on my own. For example, when reviewing a project proposal or a design document, describing it in my notes helps me to understand it better, and then those notes can be used to have an LLM help me to refine my understanding further by generating questions or challenges to that approach. For example, GPT-4o is very good at reminding me of potential security concerns with ideas. I can then use this to inspire more critique. And don't worry, Shopify provides us with internal LLMs that are safe to use with our data.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Deciding: gathering becomes actionable</strong></h2><p>The next step in the main activity loop is deciding what to do with the information that has been gathered. Being an effective manager is not just about having a lot of information, but using it to bring about greater change. Fundamentally, this is where you can add a ton of value.</p><p>As I write notes in my gathering phase throughout the day, I try to periodically review them to decide what to do with them. For each part of my notes, I ask myself:</p><ul><li><p>Is this purely a note that I've made to help me understand and remember? If so, I can probably leave it where it is.</p></li><li><p>Is this information part of a larger project or initiative that I have distinct pages for? If so, I move it to that page.</p></li><li><p>Is this information incomplete in some way, or do I not actually fully understand it? If so, I need to ask more questions or do more research. I'll tag that note with a <code>#question</code> tag to remind myself to come back to it later. I also have a <code>#research</code> tag for things that I need to look up and read in more detail.</p></li><li><p>Is this information something that I need to act on? If so, I'll consider what needs to be done, and then convert it into a <code>TODO</code> item with a scheduled due date.</p></li></ul><p>That's all fine and well for formulating my own decisions explicitly about what to do next with my own work, but there is also the ability to make implicit decisions that improve the work of others.</p><p>How do you do that?</p><p>Well, a skill that I've been practicing is trying not to accept any information that I have entirely on face value, and instead see if I can insert myself as a critical thinker that can find improvements. What I mean by this is that I try to ask myself if there are any assumptions in the information that I've gathered that I can challenge, or if there are any questions that I can ask that might lead to a better outcome.</p><p>A good rule of thumb to judge your progress in a system like this is by measuring what proportion of your gathering turns into decisions and actions that you then take. If you act on a lot of information that you're gathering, then you'll find that you are tuned into the right things and that you're adding value. </p><p>If you're not acting on much of what you're gathering, then you're probably not gathering the right things, or you're not being critical enough in your decision-making.</p><p>Maybe this is best explained by example.</p><p>Let's say that I am reading through a project proposal and making notes while I do so. This proposal is for a new feature that we want to build, which is a new widget that will be displayed on our website. It outlines a technical approach that the team wants to take, and the expected impact that it will have on our users.</p><p>There are two ways that I could approach this:</p><ul><li><p>I could treat this as purely a gathering exercise, and just note what this team is going to do and what they expect to happen. I could then move on to the next thing.</p></li><li><p>I could proactively <em>engage</em> with the proposal, and see it as an opportunity to further my understanding of the project, be more sure that we are making the right decisions, and therefore add value for myself and the team. I could press on alternative design choices, ask for more detail on how this scales during peak traffic load, or I could go back to first principles in order to question anything that I consider to be an assumption.</p></li></ul><p>The second approach is the one that should be aimed for. It's actually something I do with my direct reports: when reviewing project proposals I list out my thinking process and questions in my notes, and try to challenge assumptions where I can. This almost always generates dialogue that leads to a better project outcome.</p><p>Even if you aren't making an explicit decision, using your gathering phase as an opportunity to engage with the information, attempting to raise the bar for quality, brevity, and clarity makes you a more effective manager, and quite frankly, just makes work far more <em>fun</em>.</p><p>Implicitly, this increase in engagement will lead to better decisions from those that you are interacting with since you know you are holding them accountable to a higher standard.</p><h2><strong>Executing: getting things done</strong></h2><p>The final part of the loop is executing on the decisions that you've made. Effectively this breaks down into two parts:</p><ul><li><p>Executing on the decisions and tasks that you've made for <em>yourself</em>.</p></li><li><p>Ensuring that everything that you are accountable for via <em>others</em> is making progress.</p></li></ul><p>The first part is fairly simple. If I have a discrete task that I need to do, then I'll have made a <code>TODO</code> item for it in my notes, and I'll have scheduled it for a specific day. Then it's just a case of working through my to-do list, which is straightforward and doesn't need much explanation.</p><p>The second part is more nuanced and less solvable with todos. As a senior manager, there are tons of conversations, decisions, and actions that are in flight at any one time that I need to be aware of. These can't be captured as discrete Boolean tasks.</p><p>What I've been doing to ensure that I don't drop the ball here is utilizing the tagging that we covered in the gathering phase. I have a <code>#chase</code> tag that I use to flag anything that needs to be kept in my working memory on a given day. </p><p>This means that I can then search Logseq for all of the <code>#chase</code> items that I have, forming a different kind of to-do list that is more about keeping track of the things that I need to follow up on or monitor, rather than the things that I actually need to <em>complete</em>.</p><p>Examples of things that end up on my <code>#chase</code> list are:</p><ul><li><p>Actions that I've asked others to take, such as finding out information, having conversations, or getting consensus.</p></li><li><p>Reminders to go and check on data each day to see how something in progressing, such as metrics after a new feature ships, or ongoing incidents.</p></li><li><p>Escalations that we are waiting on a response for, such as a priority decision for another team, or a decision from a stakeholder.</p></li></ul><p>These are all non-Boolean tasks; effectively it's me periodically refreshing my mental cache. The chase list never really gets to zero, and nor should it. It grows and shrinks fairly organically.</p><p>By separating out discrete <code>TODO</code> items from <code>#chase</code> items, I can aim for inbox zero on my to-dos but I can also keep a continual eye on the more complex and nuanced things that I need to be aware of.</p><p>I hope that this article has given you some insight into how I manage my day-to-day work, and how I use the gather-decide-execute loop to keep on top of things. If you run your day differently, I'd love to hear about it in the comments.</p><p>If you're more interested in what a senior management role looks like in technology, then my latest book will be of interest to you. <a href=\"https://pragprog.com/titles/jsenglb/become-a-great-engineering-leader/\">Become a Great Engineering Leader</a> is available as a DRM-free eBook or in print from your favorite online bookstore.</p><p>And if you enjoy my writing every month, then a <a href=\"https://theengineeringmanager.substack.com/\">paid subscription via Substack</a> is a way of supporting me to keep the caffeine flowing.</p><p>Until next time, happy note-taking!</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://theengineeringmanager.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication.

We've seen the culture and growth of our companies changing due to the macroeconomic climate, a proliferation of LLM-based tools and technologies, and, fundamentally, as leaders, we've had to change how we think about our roles and our output.</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://theengineeringmanager.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication.

Let's take a look at each of these areas in turn.</p><h2><strong>Efficiency is key</strong></h2><p>Let's start with culture. If there is one theme to highlight as we head into next year, it would be <em>efficiency</em>.</p><p>I have written before about <a href=\"https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/being-in-the-details/\">the increasing need for managers to be in the details</a> as we ride out this current macroeconomic period.</p><p>The economy is presently characterized by less cheap debt and investment being available, and the knock-on effect is that there is less growth and a more challenging environment for startups.</p><p>If you work for a bigger company, you will likely see headcount staying stable so that the balance sheet can be kept under control. People who leave may not get backfilled. Asking for more people to get things done is no longer a viable strategy.</p><p>For those who are in the initial half of their careers, this is a new experience. For over a decade we have been able to raise, borrow, and grow our way out of problems. Now, we need to be <em>efficient</em> as a primary goal.</p><p>But how long will this last?</p><p>Looking at the charts on <a href=\"https://layoffs.fyi/\">layoffs.fyi</a>, we can see that an increase in layoffs began in 2022 as we exited the COVID <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_interest-rate_policy\">Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP)</a> period. The magnitude of these layoffs peaked in 2023, and they have been on a downward trend since.</p><p>It looks, dare I say, like we are back to \"normal\" levels of layoffs, and thus some level of stability seems to have been reached. Whatever large corrections that were needed to unwind the excesses of the ZIRP period have now seemingly been made.</p><p>However, this period of stability doesn't mean that all of our books are balanced and we're clear to start growing again. It is combined with an increase in interest rates and inflation, which means that the cost of capital is high. This means it is expensive to borrow, and institutional investors are investing less, <em><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-cloud-funding-us-europe-israel-hit-79-bln-2024-accel-says-2024-10-16/\">unless</a></em><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-cloud-funding-us-europe-israel-hit-79-bln-2024-accel-says-2024-10-16/\"> you are in the red-hot AI space.</a></p><p>As such, many non-AI companies are entering a period of <em>efficiency</em>, where they are looking to optimize towards profitability. This involves seeing which levers they can pull (e.g., reprioritize, do less, or work smarter and/or harder) to make the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenueperemployee.asp\">revenue per employee</a> go up, the costs go down, and cash reserves increase in order to give more runway to weather any further economic uncertainty.</p><p>For people who currently find themselves out of work, this is a <em>tough</em> time. It is especially tough for engineers that are at the start of their careers, as companies are tending to hire more experienced engineers who can hit the ground running and be more productive. Some companies are bucking the trend here, and I must <a href=\"https://internships.shopify.com/\">make a shout-out to my employer for their excellent intern program</a>. However, the trend is clear: companies are looking to hire fewer and more senior people in general.</p><p>For ambitious managers, especially those that had 5-year plans to become newly minted VPs, unfortunately, the game has changed. Whereas a few years back the play was to be at the right company at the right time in order to ride the wave of growth and take charge of increasingly large teams, being a successful manager now means being able to <em><a href=\"https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/growth/parkinsons-law-its-real-so-use-it/\">do more with less</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/performance-management-the-rising-tide/\">keep talent density high</a></em> by hiring the best and exiting the worst, and to <em><a href=\"https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/being-in-the-details/\">provably be in the details</a></em> whilst shipping fast and often.</p><p>In the current climate, which I see continuing into 2025, the best managers will be the ones that <em>don't</em> need more people to get the job done. They are running small, highly focused orgs that are able to ship quickly and efficiently. Managers that are unable to prioritize and focus their teams will find themselves in a tough spot. Every engineer counts, and reinforcements are not coming.</p><p>This, of course, is both common sensical and a return to the roots of what it means to be a great software engineer: to turn ideas into code and then to use that code as the lever that moves the world. Expect a return of tropes around <a href=\"https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-10x-engineer-evolution/\">10x engineers</a>, <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html\">founder mode</a>, and a desire for a Musk-like mindset. Depending on your perspective, this may or may not be your cup of tea.</p><p>As the years go by, whatever is happening in the economy may change again, meaning we may see a return to growth and expansion. But for now, we need to leave peacetime leadership behind and put our wartime hats on: we need to be <em>efficient</em>. And we also need to ensure that we incentivize our teams to be efficient, too.</p><p>We need to enter 2025 thinking about:</p><ul><li><p>How can we ruthlessly deprioritize anything that isn't essential, and how can we instill this mindset into every engineer on our teams? For example, does that refactor <em>really</em> have to happen now? What does it measurably improve? Also, is that feature <em>really</em> necessary? Can we sunset that service that no one uses so we have more time to focus on the things that matter instead?</p></li><li><p>How can we ensure that we <a href=\"https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/performance-management-the-rising-tide/\">keep raising the performance bar</a> so that our best people get better, and those that aren't up to scratch are either coached up or out? Does our organization have a culture of high performance, or are we letting underperformance slide? And how much is that down to <em>you</em> as a leader? Are you avoiding the hard conversations?</p></li><li><p>How can we put a key focus on productivity? Are we able to understand what the productivity of our teams is? Can we find ways to isolate bottlenecks in getting shit done and remove them? Questions you can ask include: What's the average cycle time of a task? How long does it take to deploy to production? How long does it take to review a pull request? What is the average number of commits per week per engineer? Why is it like that?</p></li><li><p>How can we ensure that we are using the best tools available to us right now? How many of our engineers are using AI to help them write code? If it's hardly any, then <em>why</em>? Seems mad not to, right? And how much pair programming are we doing, especially remotely? What's the average skill level of the team, and is it going upwards?</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Not letting skepticism turn into cynicism</strong></h2><p>If efficiency has been the <em>cultural</em> trend, then AI has been the <em>technological</em> trend of 2024. LLMs have become so ubiquitous so quickly that it almost feels clich\u00e9d to be writing about them, but then again, that ubiquity is <em>exactly</em> why I am writing about them.</p><p>LLMs have gone through the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle\">Gartner Hype Cycle</a> so fast that I am unsure where we are on it anymore. If you're not familiar with that model, it's a plot of visibility against time that suggests that new technologies go through a cycle of hype, disillusionment, and then a gradual slope towards enlightenment and, finally, productivity.</p><p>If I had to place my own stance on LLMs on the Hype Cycle graph, it would be <em>productivity</em>. I have fully embraced them in my day-to-day life. My usage spans across:</p><ul><li><p>Using ChatGPT for general research and idea generation (e.g., last night I re-taught myself how derivatives work by having a conversation with it)</p></li><li><p>Using <a href=\"https://www.cursor.com/\">Cursor</a> to reignite my love of writing code by making it so easy to throw out ideas and see what sticks. With a new baby at home, my spare time is limited, but in 30 minutes I can get a <em>lot</em> done with Cursor by letting it handle common boilerplate and remembering syntax for me: I can focus on the <em>interesting</em> parts of the problem.</p></li><li><p>Spending an increasing amount of time with <a href=\"https://perplexity.ai/\">Perplexity</a> to search the web. I tend to use it over Google now. I love the conversational interface, how it cites its sources, and how I have the ability to continually ask more follow-on questions to broaden or narrow what I am searching for.</p></li></ul><p>LLMs are a new layer of abstraction that talk directly to my inner geek teenager: they are cool, fun, feel like magic, and remind me of the near-unlimited promise of computing in the 90s.</p><p>They, of course, are not perfect. Or even deterministic!</p><p>But I am familiar enough with LLM models that I understand their limitations and can work <em>with</em> them: they may hallucinate, they may be biased, and I definitely need to cross-reference and double-check anything that I want to present elsewhere as a fact. However, I am far, far beyond the point where I would feel comfortable with them not being a part of my daily workflow. They are just too useful.</p><p>However, the same cannot be said for everyone in our industry. There is something about LLMs that has sparked a deep cycle of cynicism about AI in many people. Especially engineers.</p><p>Yes, training these models is insanely expensive. Yes, there are questions to ask about how the data used to train them was sourced. Yes, it may mean that the core of our jobs as software engineers is changing. And of course, I can understand that it can feel threatening to have models that can do things that we have spent our entire lives learning to do.</p><p>However, being deeply cynical about new technology is not a healthy place to be for you, your teams, or your company. Cynical people are just awful to work with. We are surrounded by an embarrassment of riches.</p><p>This is not the first time that a breakthrough has come along and flipped everything on its head. It also will not be the last time. The best engineers are the ones that are able to <em>adapt</em> to new technologies and use them to their advantage, whether that be increasing their productivity, finding new ways to solve problems, or even just having some fun with it.</p><p>We need to rekindle an excitement and optimism about the future of technology. Ideas need to represent play and possibility, not something to turn our noses up at because we don't yet see the possibilities. Nothing is ever perfect when it first comes out, but that doesn't mean that it won't get better. And any idea that has potential <em>will</em> get better if it brings value to people.</p><p>I remember when the iPhone first came out, and I signed up for early access to the developer program, sometime in late 2007. After getting access in 2008 and signing an NDA, I was given access to some of the worst documentation I have ever used, and building my first apps in XCode and Objective-C was nothing short of <em>insanely</em> frustrating. I would lose days dealing with bugs that were not my fault.</p><p>And it wasn't just struggling through poor documentation and occasionally broken build tooling: getting listed on the App Store included the need to spend several hours on an expensive transatlantic phone call with the IRS in Philadelphia to get a tax ID number even though I was a UK citizen. As a student, that phone bill was <em>not</em> fun.</p><p>But sticking with it despite the frustrations was also immensely rewarding: not only did I get to be on the frontier of a new technology and new set of skills, I got the chance to connect to a whole new community of developers and users that I would never have met otherwise. I made back that phone bill pretty quickly too.</p><p>And guess what? All of those issues we faced at the frontier are now ironed out and nonexistent. Today's jank will be tomorrow's polish. Humans make everything better with time. LLMs will be no different, and neither will the umpteen other technologies that will come along in the future. Stick with them, and we will be rewarded.</p><p>Be skeptical, but don't be cynical. It has never been as good as it has been now to be a software engineer. And it's only going to get better.</p><h2><strong>The generational divide</strong></h2><p>If you spent time with your family over the holidays, you may have noticed how the older folks amongst you may or may not have had technology leave them behind. You may have parents in their eighties who are just as comfortable with a smartphone as you are, or have relatives in their sixties who don't even have an email address.</p><p>Getting left behind isn't just something that happens to our parents. It can happen to us and our companies too. Take a look at yourself and your team and think about any growing divide in your skills, knowledge, and comfort with new technologies. Are you and your team building the frontier, keeping up with new developments, or are you being left behind?</p><p>The pace of change in technology is only going to increase. Are you working somewhere that moves fast enough to keep up with it?</p><p>Sure, you may have an engineer who considers themselves a software <em>craftsperson</em> and refuses to use AI to help them write code. But how much more productive could they be if they opened their mind a little and did? Have they even tried?</p><p>And, more importantly, which new competitor full of young engineers using Cursor will come along and blow you out of the water before next year is even over?</p><p>This divide doesn't just apply to writing code either. If you are a manager, are you measuring yourself correctly against your <em>output</em> or incorrectly against your <em>busyness</em>?</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><p>Is that manual process that you're doing every week to crunch staff allocations through various spreadsheets actually something that software could do for you, or are you performing that manual process because it makes you <em>feel</em> useful? I see you...</p></li><li><p>Have you experimented with using LLMs to help write first drafts of your documentation using your code as input?</p></li><li><p>Have you thought of trying something like <a href=\"https://graphite.dev/\">Graphite</a> to do initial pull request reviews for your team? How much time could that save you?</p></li><li><p>Are all of your engineers using <a href=\"https://www.cursor.com/\">Cursor</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot\">Copilot</a> or similar? Have you measured the impact of them using these tools on their output, such as commits merged per week or cycle time? And is that a taboo subject in your organization? Why?</p></li></ul><p>We opened this article talking about <em>efficiency</em>: we need to do more with less in 2025. We need to drive up the productivity of our teams, and we need to measure ourselves as managers on the <em>impact per engineer</em> that we have.</p><p>It just so happens that through AI we have a glut of new tools that can drive that number upwards. But we need to be willing to embrace these tools, even if they are not perfect, and even if it means that we need to continually rethink what it means to be a software engineer. Let go of the past.</p><p>We become better engineers by building, embracing, and furthering technology, moving ourselves up the stack of abstraction, allowing us to become far more productive than we <em>ever</em> thought possible. We need to be <em>optimistic</em> about the future of technology, not <em>cynical</em>. There is no better time to be alive.</p><p>What's coming next is exciting. I am excited. If you are not, you might just find your company being left behind.</p><p>Onward. Happy new year.</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://theengineeringmanager.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">The Engineering Manager is a reader-supported publication.

When technical leaders can't get initiatives approved or implemented, they typically blame process, prioritization, or technical disagreements. However, the real blockers usually lie in human psychology and organizational dynamics.<br><br>Business people don't have the same conception of the long-term health of a system as engineers do. They use the same words (flashback to every time you've heard someone in a suit say 'agile', 'tech debt' or 'estimate'), but they mean entirely different things in their consciousness.</p><p>When they push back, they're often not pushing back against your proposal but against the narrative in their heads.</p><h2>The Power of Narrative and Identity</h2><p>One of the most powerful tools for organizational influence is <a href=\"https://www.engineeringorg.com/narratives-part-1/\">narrative</a> - the stories people tell about you and your initiatives. Every interaction contributes to this narrative. Every time you pop your head into your boss's door, you add one more data point to their perception of you. And their reaction will be the reaction that causes least cognitive dissonance - ie one that perpetuates their narrative about you. To gain influence is to consciously shape this narrative.</p><blockquote><p>A CTO needed budget for a principal engineer and was asked to write a detailed document justifying the hire. \"What should I put in the document?\" he asked.<br><br>While the document mattered, the real issue was more fundamental: I asked - \"Why do you want to be in a situation where you have to write a document when you want to do something?\"</p></blockquote><p>The reason he had to write a document when he wanted something was because when he popped his head into his boss's cabin, the reaction was one of tension - of having to deal with a person who made no sense. To get to a point where the answer is always yes, he would have to change this fundamental reality of the relationship.</p><p>Without this he is \u2013 and you are \u2013 fighting an uphill battle.</p><p>In the rest of this article, I will show you some techniques for upping your influence game.</p><h2>Building Influence: A Strategic Approach</h2><p>Here's a practical framework for building and exercising influence:<br><br><strong>1. Start with What Others Want</strong></p><p>The fundamental shift that many technical leaders need to make is from pushing their own agenda to understanding and aligning with others' needs. If you're having trouble getting buy-in, it might be time to stop pushing and rather getting people in the habit of saying yes to you (The Socratic Method of Organisational Influence, if you will).</p><p>Trust, or goodwill, is the currency of politics. Some call it 'social capital'. People don't want to think. Help them out by being on their side. For one quarter, focus exclusively on asking people what they want and helping them achieve it. This builds trust and creates social capital you can later spend on your initiatives. Humans are very simple creatures. If they've said yes to your ideas before, they will continue to say yes. As I said - they don't want to think.</p><p>A crucial part of this approach is understanding and articulating Return on Investment (ROI) in terms that matter to others.</p><p>Consider a common scenario: an engineer wants to update dependencies or optimize code. Instead of focusing on technical elegance (\"we should use only the specific AWS SDK modules we need instead of the whole package\"), frame it in terms of business value (\"let me help you understand how this investment of QA time now will pay off in terms of deployment speed and reliability\").</p><p>If you can't articulate why someone should invest organizational resources in your initiative, you need to rethink your approach.</p><p>Remember: what seems like an obvious technical improvement to an engineer isn't always worth the organizational overhead. Learn to evaluate and present your initiatives not just in terms of technical merit, but in terms of concrete business benefits: time saved, risks mitigated, or opportunities enabled.</p><ol start=\"2\"><li><p><strong>Be them</strong></p></li></ol><p>In order to start with others want, you will have to 'be them' for a while.</p><blockquote><p>At rBus, we sold employee transportation services to corporates and as such we often had to pitch to corporate admins. Our head of sales had a fascinating technique. <br><br>During client meetings, he'd start by sitting across the table from the prospect, laptop open, discussing pricing and features - a typical sales setup with clear \"seller\" and \"buyer\" sides. But then, at a crucial moment, he'd do something subtle yet powerful: he'd pick up his laptop, walk around to the client's side of the table, and sit next to them.<br><br>As they worked through the details together, he'd use language like \"when you and I do this\" and \"we will tell them that this is not acceptable\" \u2013 who is the them? his own company! \u2013 subtly shifting the dynamic from a transactional sales pitch to a collaborative planning session. The prospect was no longer being sold to - they were now part of the solution design.</p></blockquote><p>This same principle applies to driving change within organizations. It's not just about what you're proposing - it's about who people think you are when you're proposing it.</p><p>Talking to another CTO about getting buy in he said 'I go with a spreadsheet of the RoI on any measure I'm proposing. I told him my technique</p><blockquote><p>\"When I have a big ask from business leadership, I make sure they see me in the office when they come in. I make sure they see me in the office when they leave. I dress like them, and I only talk about business.\"</p></blockquote><p>This isn't about superficial mimicry - it's about identity. Business leaders need to identify you as one of them before they'll truly hear your ideas. Technical leaders often think they can win purely through logic and data, but these are identity issues. When the esteemed stakeholders look at you, they need to see someone who thinks like them, who understands their concerns, who shares their priorities.</p><p>Also, and I say this with utmost seriousness \u2013 nothing changed the trajectory of my career as much as taking the needs of business leadership seriously and only then trying to convince them of a middle-ground that worked for both the short and long terms.</p><p><strong>3. Create Witnesses Through Regular Cadence</strong></p><p>ie Document.</p><p>Documentation isn't just about technical knowledge - it's about power and influence (muahahahah - He who keeps the notes has the power!). But seriously, when you maintain clear records of decisions, commitments, and progress, you create a shared reality that others must acknowledge. The 'must acknowledge' bit is important. People will always reach for a version of events that makes them a hero. An impartial, historical record of everything forces people to acknowledge the past correctly.</p><p>The way to collect this record is through boring-ass, regular cadence meetings. Regular meetings aren't just about status updates - they're about creating shared understanding and witnesses to decisions and commitments. These meetings provide a platform to:<br>- Document decisions and commitments<br>- Build consensus<br>- Create accountability<br>- Maintain momentum on initiatives<br>and most importanly <br>- it creates a permanent record that people can't wiggle out of. The first time they try to wiggle out, let them, but make it uncomfortable. This should make them more aware of their accountability. Only drive the knife in the second time ;-). Basic iron-fist-velvet-glove stuff.</p><p>Any organisation that doesn't have <a href=\"https://www.engineeringorg.com/how-to-not-be-a-micro-manager-part/\">regular cadences</a> is not a serious organisation.<br><br><strong>4. The \"Help Me Understand\" Technique</strong><br><br>One powerful tool is what I call the \"help me understand\" technique. Instead of confronting or challenging, phrase your concerns as requests for clarification:<br><br>\"Help me understand - the document says this, but our spec says that. Can you help me understand why the two are different?\"<br><br>This approach has to be used sparingly though. Use it too much and they'll go for drinks without you and say 'help me understand' to the waiter and burst out laughing. When used well though, it defuses a number of emotional booby-traps. It places you in a subordinate posture rather than a confrontational one. It makes others feel respected and heard and allows them to recognize and frame issues in a way that is less threatening to them and so avoids triggering defensive reactions</p><h2>To be continued...</h2><p>In the next edition, I will talk about more advanced methods of influence building - the art of giving credit and managing up, amongst others. That will be a paid post as that knowledge could be dangerous in the wrong hands.

The key is recognizing that technical excellence alone isn't enough - you need to master the human elements of organizational change. Start by building trust, understanding others' motivations, and creating allies rather than adversaries. Remember, the goal isn't to win arguments, but to create an environment where your good ideas can naturally flourish and take root.<br><br>Remember the sales lesson: success often comes not from pushing harder from across the table, but from finding ways to get on the same side as those you're trying to influence. Whether you're dealing with business leadership, product managers, or other teams, the key is to shift from being seen as an outsider pushing change to an insider working towards shared success.<br><br>The most successful technical leaders aren't necessarily the most technically brilliant - they're the ones who understand how to work with human nature rather than against it. As you develop these skills, you'll find that your ability to drive meaningful change grows exponentially.</p><h2>One last word</h2><p>If you've tried everything and your organisation is too toxic for you, it might be time for a change.

And I can think only of one thing that can do this - mastery.</p><h2>The office as the master's workshop</h2><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4197c395-dc8f-4a92-bcc5-3bb840ab818d_1100x750.webp\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4197c395-dc8f-4a92-bcc5-3bb840ab818d_1100x750.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4197c395-dc8f-4a92-bcc5-3bb840ab818d_1100x750.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4197c395-dc8f-4a92-bcc5-3bb840ab818d_1100x750.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4197c395-dc8f-4a92-bcc5-3bb840ab818d_1100x750.webp 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4197c395-dc8f-4a92-bcc5-3bb840ab818d_1100x750.webp\" width=\"1100\" height=\"750\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4197c395-dc8f-4a92-bcc5-3bb840ab818d_1100x750.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:750,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;A Rare Glimpse into the World of Katana Sword-Making with Matsunaga |  Kyushu Tourism Organization | Visit Kyushu&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"A Rare Glimpse into the World of Katana Sword-Making with Matsunaga |  Kyushu Tourism Organization | Visit Kyushu\" title=\"A Rare Glimpse into the World of Katana Sword-Making with Matsunaga |  Kyushu Tourism Organization | Visit Kyushu\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4197c395-dc8f-4a92-bcc5-3bb840ab818d_1100x750.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4197c395-dc8f-4a92-bcc5-3bb840ab818d_1100x750.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4197c395-dc8f-4a92-bcc5-3bb840ab818d_1100x750.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4197c395-dc8f-4a92-bcc5-3bb840ab818d_1100x750.webp 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Would you drag yourself through traffic to work here?</figcaption></figure></div><p>I see your offices and, dear engineering leader, I see your flinching from the responsibilities of mastery.

They are too shy to ask for this themselves.</p><h2>The WeWork pandemic</h2><p>I blame the pandemic. The WeWork pandemic. The temporary offices that no one can change, shape and mould to the shape of their own work. An office is a space where work happens, and the work that happens is shaped by the environment that encloses it. If it is not in the correct shape, the work will also be awkward, lopsided, mis-shapen. It will come from a wrong mindset. It will arrive diluted and spent already in this world.</p><p>No sir, the shape of your office should fit the work. Your people are bringing their energy, skill and intellect to this space and the space is making it dull, diffuse and impotent. <em><strong>An office is like a lens, refracting and reflecting the energy of its occupants</strong></em>. Use the mirrors wisely and you can get a concentration of attention focussed on your work. Use them poorly and watch those photons of attention disperse into space, achieving nothing.</p><p>And you cannot just take some plan that was designed for a 3000 person corporation \u2013 for interchangeable cogs in a corporate machine \u2013 and expect it to work for your bespoke group of talented and creative developers.</p><p>Open plan offices are, in reality, isolating. They force people to keep one eye on the work and one eye out for interruptions. They are neither designed for serendipity not for focus. They drain the introvert nerd.</p><p>Meeting rooms are contentious resources. Everyone needs them, and they are never enough.</p><p>Is it really that hard to build a space where people can focus when they need to and work together when they need to? It's not. You just need to want it. You need to realise just how critical this shape of the office is to getting good work done.</p><h2>My dream office.</h2><p>At the heart of the dream office is the library. It always shocks me how few technology companies have a library, and don't even get me started on librarians. The presence of books and a quiet place to read them is, in my opinion, catnip for the kind of developers you want. What kind of master programmer does not have a library. Books read over and over again, thumbed through, with notes, carrying with them the scars of the intellectual endeavours of those who came before.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35709c33-de6a-49ee-a436-dbf9ceb626e2_1024x1024.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35709c33-de6a-49ee-a436-dbf9ceb626e2_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35709c33-de6a-49ee-a436-dbf9ceb626e2_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35709c33-de6a-49ee-a436-dbf9ceb626e2_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35709c33-de6a-49ee-a436-dbf9ceb626e2_1024x1024.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35709c33-de6a-49ee-a436-dbf9ceb626e2_1024x1024.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/35709c33-de6a-49ee-a436-dbf9ceb626e2_1024x1024.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35709c33-de6a-49ee-a436-dbf9ceb626e2_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35709c33-de6a-49ee-a436-dbf9ceb626e2_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35709c33-de6a-49ee-a436-dbf9ceb626e2_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35709c33-de6a-49ee-a436-dbf9ceb626e2_1024x1024.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Artists impression of a viable library setup.

Not meeting rooms that teams use when they need them but actual rooms to fit 4-6 people and their tools and whiteboards. This is where the mess of creation happens.

Add some table lamps and some thoughtful lighting, for which the options are incredible right now.</p><p>It just needs the love and attention of the Master.</p><h2>The office as social space</h2><p>It's ok for everyone to not be in the office every day. But it's not ok to have any office where no one wants to come to. And one of the draws of the office are the people in it. The Master chooses his apprentices well, and so they all have no problem getting along. And as they work together, they will also do other things together. Eat. Study. Play sports. Find each other.</p><p>There are so many people complaining about loneliness, and you're having trouble getting people out of their homes and to the most social space they have at their disposal. A space designed for spending time together, working together and growing together. How is it that your people don't want this?</p><p>Is it because you're making this all about you? How about maybe taking a smaller space and just designing it better? How about bringing on board a real office admin - someone who sees the office as a space to be nurtured. How about giving your employees some autonomy, a small budget to spend as they deem fit on their working conditions.</p><h2>The office as a vessel of culture</h2><blockquote><p>While we were building rBus, our designer and frontend developer would print out one funny, edgy, designy page every day and put them up. Over time the office became this smorgasbord of quotes and Ryan Gosling posters and so on and it really gave the whole space a sense of character. rBus didn't last long enough but I like to think that if it had, his work and love for the space would have reverberated through it for everyone that followed.</p></blockquote><p>Physical spaces get scarred, they get spilt on, written on, singed, broken, fixed -</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea145b8b-8ba2-4b93-89dd-7ae90eb88145_1200x800.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea145b8b-8ba2-4b93-89dd-7ae90eb88145_1200x800.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea145b8b-8ba2-4b93-89dd-7ae90eb88145_1200x800.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea145b8b-8ba2-4b93-89dd-7ae90eb88145_1200x800.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea145b8b-8ba2-4b93-89dd-7ae90eb88145_1200x800.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea145b8b-8ba2-4b93-89dd-7ae90eb88145_1200x800.jpeg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ea145b8b-8ba2-4b93-89dd-7ae90eb88145_1200x800.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:800,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Life hacks: wabi-sabi&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"Life hacks: wabi-sabi\" title=\"Life hacks: wabi-sabi\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea145b8b-8ba2-4b93-89dd-7ae90eb88145_1200x800.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea145b8b-8ba2-4b93-89dd-7ae90eb88145_1200x800.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea145b8b-8ba2-4b93-89dd-7ae90eb88145_1200x800.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea145b8b-8ba2-4b93-89dd-7ae90eb88145_1200x800.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>All of these events in the life of things give them 'character', which is nothing but a record of the things that happened.

A sense, one might even say, of history.</p><p>And it is this seasoned vibe \u2013 you can feel it in temples and churches and opera halls and dive bars of considerable vintage \u2013 that makes a place irresistible. Something subliminal tells us that this place is 'lindy', that it survives, it abides and it is worth preserving.</p><p>This excitement of the emotions is not possible in a WeWork, where you cannot even put a nail in the wall.
