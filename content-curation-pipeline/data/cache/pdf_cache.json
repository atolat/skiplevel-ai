We propose AutoLibra\n , a framework\nfor agent evaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback e.g.\u201cIf\nyou find that the button is disabled, don\u2019t click it again \u201d, or \u201cThis agent\nhas too much autonomy to decide what to do on its own \u201d into metrics for\nevaluating fine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories. AutoLibra accom-\nplishes this by grounding feedback to an agent\u2019s behavior, clustering similar\npositive and negative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear\ndefinitions and concrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-\nas-a-Judge as evaluators. We further propose two meta-metrics to evaluate\nthe alignment of a set of (induced) metrics with open feedback: \u201ccoverage\u201d\nand \u201credundancy\u201d. Through optimizing these meta-metrics, we experi-\nmentally demonstrate AutoLibra\u2019s ability to induce more concrete agent\nevaluation metrics than the ones proposed in previous agent evaluation\nbenchmarks and discover new metrics to analyze agents. We also present\ntwo applications of AutoLibra in agent improvement : First, we show that\nAutoLibra-induced metrics serve as better prompt-engineering targets than\nthe task success rate on a wide range of text game tasks, improving agent\nperformance over baseline by a mean of 20%. Second, we show that AutoLi-\nbra can iteratively select high-quality fine-tuning data for web navigation\nagents. Our results suggest that AutoLibra is a powerful task-agnostic tool\nfor evaluating and improving language agents.\n1 Introduction\nHumans readily acquire skills from open-ended instructions and feedback from others\n(Tomasello et al., 1993). These instructions and feedback are internalized for self-regulated\nlearning (Pintrich & Zusho, 2002; Nicol & Macfarlane-Dick, 2006), providing internal sig-\nnals for continuous improvement. Drawing inspiration from this process, we investigate\nhow well AI agents can benefit from open-ended human feedback through induction of\ngeneralizable metrics.\nWe can characterize existing evaluations and rewards for AI agents into two main classes:\n(1) goal-oriented evaluation \u2013 whether the agents have fulfilled the given task ,e.g.benchmarks\n(Zhou et al., 2024a; Jimenez et al., 2024; Chan et al., 2024; Paglieri et al., 2024) and reward\nmodeling approaches (Pan et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2025b; Choudhury, 2025) and (2) behavior\nevaluation \u2013 the manner the agents perform the task ,e.g. social agent and human-agent\ninteraction benchmarks (Zhou et al., 2024b; Shao et al., 2024) and agent failure mode\nanalysis (Pan et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023).1Goal-oriented evaluation\n1Note that the difference between the two classes is not whether the evaluation is based on the\noutcome or the process. Both evaluations can be performed at every step or in the final step.\n1arXiv:2505.02820v1  [cs.AI]  5 May 2025\n\nPreprint.

Here we show real examples of agent trajectories, human\nfeedback, aspects, induced metrics, evaluation results on WebVoyager (He et al., 2024).\n2\n\nPreprint. Under review.\nis often designed to be verifiable, but is not sufficiently fine-grained or comprehensive to\ndiagnose agents\u2019 behavior problems or locate improvement bottlenecks (Yehudai et al., 2025).\nAlthough the above can be complemented with behavior evaluation, it requires manual\ndesign of metrics based on top-down heuristics (Zhou et al., 2024b), or thematic analysis of\nthe agent\u2019s behavior (Shao et al., 2024; Pan et al., 2025). This manual design process requires\nthe labor of experts in annotations and classification, which limits its scalability.\nIn this paper, we introduce AutoLibra\n , a metric induction method, as a novel agent evalu-\nation framework that mitigates the limitations of current evaluation paradigms. AutoLibra\nis an evaluation tool that induces interpretable metrics for AI agents from open-ended\nhuman feedback, which can be collected from end users of AI agents or experts. This offers\ntwo key advantages: (1) It is much easier to provide concrete feedback for trajectories than\ncreating metrics, and (2) AutoLibra allows us to evaluate agents from the perspective of\nthe users. AutoLibra-induced metrics provide concrete definitions of behaviors that the\nmodel-based evaluation method should look for when evaluating AI agents, which could\nbe used to understand agent behavior, as well as optimization targets to improve agents.\nInspired by the code-theme steps of thematic analysis conducted by experts in social sciences\n(Braun & Clarke, 2006), we design the AutoLibra induction process (\u00a72.2) as two steps: (1)\nfeedback grounding : where we ground every aspect of human feedback on some behavior\nin the entire agent trajectory, and (2) behavior clustering : where we cluster the aspects into\nmultiple clusters of similar behaviors to summarize into metrics. As illustrated in Fig. 1,\nthe user gives a web agent feedback \u201cthe agent did not choose iPhone 14/15\u201d which is\ngrounded to the agent\u2019s behavior, choosing \u201ciPhone 16 Pro\u201d from the drop-down menu.\nSimilar behaviors are clustered into a common cluster, summarized as Element Interaction\nAccuracy .\nThe AutoLibra evaluation process is designed to provide a closed-loop feedback signal for\nthe induction process. The agent trajectories used in the induction process are scored by\nLLM-as-a-Judge (Zheng et al., 2023) on the induced metrics. The evaluation process (\u00a72.3)\nthen tries to match the feedback aspects, e.g.\u201crecipe does not contain quinoa\u201d, with the\ntraits, e.g.task-requirement-achievement . In this way, we can meta-evaluate the quality\nof the metrics: (i) coverage (what proportion of feedback aspects can be matched with an\nagent trait), and (ii) redundancy of the metrics (what proportion of the detected traits are\nnot mentioned by humans). These two metrics provide an overall statistical picture of the\nquality of the induced metrics. Based on these two metrics, we can search for the set of\nmetrics with the lowest redundancy within those with the highest coverage. As shown in\n\u00a73.1, we find that as the number of metrics increases, the redundancy increases, and the\ncoverage ultimately converges to the maximum coverage.\nWith AutoLibra, our aim is to answer the following research questions:\nRQ1: How aligned are the results from AutoLibra for each step with human judgment?\nRQ2: Can AutoLibra provide more insight into agent behavior that were not provided by\nexpert designed metrics?\nRQ3: Can AutoLibra provide optimization signals for human agent engineers and agent\nlearning algorithms to improve agents\u2019 performance?\nKey findings: Experiments within multiple agent domains, including collaborative agents\n(Shao et al., 2024), social agents (Zhou et al., 2024b), web agents (Zhou et al., 2024a; He\net al., 2024), and text game agents (Paglieri et al., 2024; Cloos et al., 2024), demonstrate that\nAutoLibra is able to induce fine-grained and interpretable metrics with high coverage and\nlow redundancy in unseen human feedback with 80 trajectories annotated with one feedback\nfor each trajectory per dataset. These metrics are more concrete, and some of them were\neven overlooked in expert designed metrics or error analysis (\u00a74). The fact that AutoLibra\ncan iteratively discover new, emergent metrics (\u00a73.2) throughout the agent optimization\nprocess, and provide salient and human-interpretable optimization signals helps improve\nthe performance in Baba-Is-AI by over 20% (\u00a75.1), and web-browsing task WebVoyager\nby 5% on top of previous model-based rejection fine-tuning methods (\u00a75.2) with only 18\ntrajectories annotated with one feedback for each trajectory in each improvement iteration.\n3\n\nPreprint. Under review.\n2 AutoLibra\nTo address the limitations of existing evaluation paradigms, AutoLibra\n is designed to\nmeet the following desiderata: (1) induced from agent behavior : This ensures that metrics are\ngrounded in agent trajectories rather than predefined by human experts, (2) self-validating :\nAllows choosing minimal set of metrics that cover unseen human feedback with sufficient\nabstraction to be useful across different tasks, and (3) generalizable : Applicable to various\nagent environments, independent of domain-specific design.\nBased on feedback data collected from humans (\u00a72.1), AutoLibra achieves these desiderata\nthrough a closed-loop pipeline consisting of two processes: Induction Process that converts\nagent behaviors and corresponding feedback into metrics, (\u00a72.2) and Evaluation Process\nthat predicts ratings and quality of new agent behaviors on the induced metrics (\u00a72.3).\n2.1 Collecting human feedback\nIn this paper, we use human feedback from two groups: (1) End-users \u2013 for agents that\ninteract directly with humans, we use the feedback from the users who interact and converse\nwith the agents. CoGym (Shao et al., 2024) is the environment that belongs to this category,\nand we use the user comments collected in their study, resulting in 197 trajectories with\nfeedback. (2) Experts \u2013 for agents that do not directly interact with humans, we use the\nfeedback from human annotators (five authors in this paper) who observe agent trajectories.\nAll other environments belong to this category, these being Sotopia (Zhou et al., 2024b),\nWebArena (Zhou et al., 2024a), WebVoyager (He et al., 2024), Baba-is-ai (Cloos et al., 2024),\nand MiniHack (Samvelyan et al., 2021). For each trajectory, we collect only one element of\nfeedback; feedback is given based on the complete agent trajectories.2\nINDUCTION\nSTEP 1\nFeedback Grounding\nConverting a pair of agent trajectory and \nhuman feedback into a set of aspects . An \naspect is a triple of agent behavior, feedback \naspect, and whether the aspect is postive.\nAgent  \nTrajectoryHuman \nFeedback Aspectssome behavior in \nthe trajectory\ncorresponding \nfeedback aspectLLM\nFigure 2: Feedback GroundingAnnotators are instructed to explicitly indicate the\naspects of agent behavior that they classify as good\nor bad, and to avoid general comments such as \"The\nagent is good at solving the task\" . The annotators can\nalso choose from a TTY (TeleTYpewriter) or a web\ninterface; in both cases the annotator is provided\nwith the agent\u2019s task and then view the agent\u2019s ob-\nservation and actions step by step, in text form.3For\nmulti-agent tasks, we annotate each agent\u2019s trajectory\nin a given interaction separately. For Sotopia (Zhou\net al., 2024b), WebArena (Zhou et al., 2024a), and\nWebVoyager (He et al., 2024), we annotate 100 trajec-\ntories of agents based on GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023)\nwith feedback for each dataset. For experiments in\n\u00a75 we annotate 18 trajectories for each dataset in\neach iteration. The annotation process is fast: Hu-\nman annotators spend less than 5 minutes to provide\nfeedback for each trajectory; \u00a74, we randomly hold out 20% of the trajectories for validation.\n2.2 Induction Process: agent trajectories and human feedback \u2192evaluation metrics\nFeedback Grounding The feedback of human annotators can contain multiple aspects;\ne.g.\u201cAI agent was pretty good at giving me a consistent itinerary and vacation plan, although\nit froze on the last couple of minutes.\u201d , collected from human annotators in CoGym (Shao\net al., 2024), contains a positive aspect about the agent\u2019s ability to generate a consistent\nitinerary, and a negative aspect about the agent freezing at the end. Here we define an aspect\nas a triple (behavior ,feedback ,sign ). In the positive aspect of the previous example, the\n2While in theory we can leverage feedback on specific steps to achieve better feedback grounding\nand multiple feedback for single trajectory, we leave it as future work.\n3While viewing screenshots is standard for web navigation tasks, we keep the observation format\nconsistent across agents and humans to encourage more grounded feedback.\n4\n\nPreprint. Under review.\nbehavior is the agent\u2019s actions to create a 20-day itinerary for the Maldives, the feedback is\nthat the created itinerary is consistent and the sign is positive. This grounding procedure is\nsimilar to the coding procedure in thematic analysis by humans.\nIllustrated in Fig. 2, in this step, we feed the trajectory and the feedback into the LLM (we\nuse GPT-4o (OpenAI et al., 2024) as it yields good results in our pilot experiments) and\nprompt the LLM with the following instructions: (1) break down the feedback into bullet\npoints; (2) for each bullet point, find the corresponding part of the trajectory to which the\nfeedback refers. Finally, we use constrained decoding to force GPT-4o to output the aspects\nin the previous format. In our experiments, we find that on most datasets, for each trajectory,\nthe LLM can generate one to five aspects, with a mean of one to two aspects.\nBehavior Clustering\nAggregate the aspects from M (trajectory, \nfeedback) pairs, and cluster them into N \nbehavior clusters with common concepts. \nThese concepts are the induced metrics . \nAutoLibra \nMetricsxN\nAspects from M \ntrajectoriesMetric \nDescriptionGood \nBehaviorsBad \nBehaviorsINDUCTION\nSTEP 2\nLLM\nFigure 3: Behavior ClusteringBehavior Clustering The second step of the extrac-\ntion process is to group the aspects into Nmetrics.\nTo illustrate this step, we consider another exam-\nple in the same dataset \u201cThe AI responds quickly to\nwrite and run the Python script\u201c where the behavior\nis the agent\u2019s action to quickly write and run a\nPython script, the feedback is that the agent responds\nquickly, and the sign is positive. Although this as-\npect is a positive aspect, it reflects the same dimen-\nsion of the agent\u2019s behavior as the previous nega-\ntive aspect, with an opposite value. Each metric is\na cluster of aspects, with a definition summarizing\nthe criteria of positive behaviors, a list of positive\nbehavior examples, and a list of negative behavior\nexamples. This clustering procedure is similar to the\ntheme induction step in thematic analysis.\nHowever, clustering similar agent behaviors together is challenging for statistical clustering\nmethods.4Inspired by LLM-based semantic clustering and concept induction methods\nViswanathan et al. (2024); Lam et al. (2024), we prompt an LLM (o3-mini high5, as it produces\nthe most accurate coverage and redundancy scores as evaluated later) to cluster the aspects\ninto metrics. As illustrated in Fig. 3, we gather all the aspects of Mtrajectories and cluster\ninto Nmetrics, where Nis a parameter set through the optimization process (\u00a73.1). We\nprovide the LLM with the following instructions: The granularity of the grouping should\nbe minimal; only very similar behaviors are grouped together; but don\u2019t limit to one particular\nwebsite or one particular character , which empirically makes the metrics more concrete but\nstill applicable across different tasks.\n2.3 Evaluation Process: evaluating agents and the quality of the induced metrics\nEvaluating agents with induced metrics LLM-as-a-Judge (Zheng et al., 2023), or more\nbroadly, model-based evaluation (Zhang et al., 2019; Celikyilmaz et al., 2021) is a method\nto use machine learning models to evaluate the output of other machine learning models.\nThe success of LLM-as-a-Judge depends on the gap between the difficulty of evaluation\nor verification and that of generation and action. In agentic tasks, this gap is often large,\nas the policy model must perform multiple steps in decision-making, while the evaluation\nmodel must only classify the trajectories, which make LLM-as-a-Judge widely used (Zhou\net al., 2024a; He et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024b). In AutoLibra, we employ LLM-as-a-Judge\nto evaluate the agent trajectories configured with the induced metrics. However, LLM-as-a-\nJudge can be replaced by any other evaluation methods implementing the induced metrics;\ne.g.aninteract-valid-element metric could be evaluated by a rule-based evaluator that\nchecks if the agent interacts with valid elements on the webpage. We note that AutoLibra\ncould be used with other evaluation methods, such as programmatic evaluation (Ma et al.,\n2024); we leave generating programs for the induced metrics for future work.\n4In preliminary experiments, we tried to use K-means clustering on the aspect vectors generated\nbytext-embedding-3-large , but the clusters are mostly based on tasks and not on the behaviors.\n5https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/\n5\n\nPreprint. Under review.\nEVALUATION\nSTEP 1\nEvaluate Agents\nThe extacted metrics can be used for \nprompting LLMs to produce ratings (+/-/NA) \nfor each metric. Positive metrics -> positive \ntraits , negative metrics -> negative traits .\nMetric DescriptionGood BehaviorsBad BehaviorsxN xN\nTraitsEvaluate each trajectory \nwith induced metricsLLM\nFigure 4: Evaluating agents with\ninduced metricsAs illustrated in Fig. 4, taking the induced metrics\nas input, an LLM (we use o3-mini medium, as it pro-\nvides similar results in this step to o3-mini high) is\nprompted to rate the agent trajectories to {+ 1, -1,\nN/A} for each metric. For an agent trajectory, the\nmetrics labeled +1 are the positive traits , and the ones\nlabeled -1 are the negative traits . When we calculate\nthe scores of the metrics, we use the ratio of agent\ntrajectories rated as positive to the ones that are rated\nas positive or negative, ignoring those rated as N/A,\nsince not all metrics are applicable to all trajectories\n(some metrics like valid-search-terms are only ap-\nplicable when the task involves searching).\nMeta evaluation The last component of the loop is\nthe meta-evaluation, i.e. evaluating the evaluation\nmetrics induced by AutoLibra. This step matches the\ntraits detected by the LLM-as-a-Judge with aspects grounded from the human feedback. The\ngoal is to verify whether (1) the induced metrics cover the behaviors the human annotators\ncare about, and (2) LLM-as-a-Judge can produce accurate evaluation results based on the\ninduced metrics. In the previous example, if the respond-promptly is extracted as a metric,\nand the LLM-as-a-Judge has the same opinion as the human annotators, then this aspect\nis considered as successfully covered. If either a similar metric was not extracted, or the\nLLM-as-a-Judge assigns a different score, then this aspect is considered as not covered.\nxMEVALUATION\nSTEP 2\nMeta Evaluation\nEvaluate how much the detected traits from \nLLM-as-a-Judge could cover the human \nfeedback aspects. A high coverage indicates \nthe completeness of the induced metrics.\nTraits AspectsMatch\nCoverage\nRedundancy\nCoverage is the overall ratio of aspects matched with traits; \nredundancy is the ratio of traits not matched any aspects.LLM\naggregation\nFigure 5: Meta evaluationAs illustrated in Fig. 5, we perform meta-evaluation\nfor each trajectory-feedback pair by classifying the\naspects into positive and negative aspects, classify-\ning traits into positive and negative traits based on\nrating, then matching the positive aspects with pos-\nitive traits and the negative aspects with negative\ntraits. We prompt an LLM (we use GPT-4o (OpenAI\net al., 2024)) with a list of aspects and another list of\ntraits and ask the LLM to find the best matching trait\nfor each aspect or decide that there is no matching\ntrait. The coverage of the whole dataset is calculated\nas the proportion of aspects of all instances that have\na matching trait, and the redundancy is calculated as\nthe proportion of traits of all instances that have not\nbeen matched with any aspect.\n3 Optimizing and validating AutoLibra\nAutoLibra is designed to be self-validating through the evaluation process, which allows\nus to search the optimal set of metrics that cover the human opinion the best (\u00a73.1). This\noptimization process can also be applied iteratively throughout the agent improvement\nprocess. As the agent is optimized, new metrics can be added to existing metrics (\u00a73.2),\nwhich is similar to how unit tests are kept throughout software development to prevent\nnew features from interfere with existing features. In the last part of this section, we study\nthe alignment between each step of AutoLibra and human judgment.\n3.1 Metric Optimization\nAs illustrated in Fig. 6, we optimize the metric induction process to maximize coverage\nand minimize redundancy . Among the two, we prioritize coverage of the metrics to\nprovide a comprehensive evaluation of the agent behavior, while minimizing overlap\nwithin the metrics to avoid redundancy, thus maximizing the utility of induced metrics.\n6\n\nPreprint.

Fig. 7 shows the\nhighest coverages of the metrics\nof size N, which converge around\nN=6to10depending on the\ndatasets. The best coverage on So-\ntopia (Zhou et al., 2024b) is the\nlowest among all four datasets,\n60%, likely due to the diversity of\nthe tasks in the dataset, while cov-\nerage on WebArena (Zhou et al.,\n2024a) and WebVoyager (He et al.,\n2024) are the highest, 88%. We also find that the coverage of the held-out trajectories is only\nslightly worse ( <5%) than the trajectories we use to induce the metrics, which is expected\nsince we use the exact examples extracted from the latter. Lastly, we show that the good and\nbad behaviors are crucial in the metrics, dropping which resulting in up to 30% coverage\ndecrease (on CoGym (Shao et al., 2024)).\n3.2 Iterative Metric Induction\nWhen applying AutoLibra to agent optimization, we can iteratively induce new metrics, as\nagents develop new failure modes or new behaviors as they improve, which is useful for\ntracking agents\u2019 progress across different iterations.6\nTo do this, we modify the behavior clustering step, by providing the LLM with the existing\nmetrics and their definitions, and ask the LLM not to change the definitions of the existing\n6Alternatively, a new set of metrics can be induced from scratch for each iteration - in practice, we\ndo not find that this results in any coverage loss, but we choose the former method for consistency\n7\n\nPreprint.

To measure the alignment of AutoLibra metric induction\nwith human judgment, we validate the feedback grounding, agent evaluation, and meta\nevaluation steps by having human experts manually review each step (with exception of\nthe behavior clustering step, as it is prohibitively time-intensive for human annotators to\nprocess and cluster more than 400 aspects), scoring (1/0) based on whether they agree with\nthe outcomes of each iteration. The coverage and redundancy scores, in combination with\nthe validation results of the other steps in the loop, thus serve as an indirect validation\nfor the behavior clustering step. Table 1 shows the agreement rate of human annotators\nin AutoLibra steps. It should be noted that these tasks are significantly different; e.g.,\ngrounding for WebVoyager (He et al., 2024) is challenging due to the length and wide action\nspace of the trajectory, and LLM-as-a-Judge for Sotopia (Zhou et al., 2024b) is difficult due\nto the complexity of the evaluation of social interactions. Our results show that the majority\n(significantly over 85%) of results in AutoLibra are reliable according to human validation.\n4 AutoLibra as a lens\n : agent evaluation with AutoLibra\nIn this section, we use AutoLibra as a lens to provide grounded, behavior-salient insights\ninto agent trajectories. In three data sets, CoGym (Shao et al., 2024), Sotopia (Zhou et al.,\n2024b), and WebVoyager (He et al., 2024), we compare induced metrics with heuristically\nproposed evaluation dimensions and failure modes summarized by the authors. We find\nthat AutoLibra can discover more concrete metrics than heuristically defined categories, and\nnovel metrics that are overlooked by experts. Tab. 2 summarizes the comparison between\nAutoLibra-induced metrics and evaluation criteria across the three aforementioned datasets.\nCoGym For CoGym (Shao et al., 2024), AutoLibra induces 9 metrics from feedback from\nend users , which can correspond to the five failure categories proposed by the authors.\nThe failure rate (frequency of a metric score of -1) measured by AutoLibra also roughly\nmatches the failure rate of the manually labeled CoGym categories by the authors. This\nshows that AutoLibra induces metrics that reflect human-expert categorization and provide\nan automated measurement of agent failures.\nSotopia In Sotopia, the authors (Zhou et al., 2024b) proposed 7 dimensions for evaluating\nsocial intelligence in AI agents. With AutoLibra, we recover the exact dimension Goal\nCompletion , and 3 metrics as the subdimensions of Believability , indicating that Believability\ncould be too high-level, while AutoLibra provides more concrete breakdown metrics. The\nfailure rate (frequency of a score of -1 metric rating, indicating the agent performs poorly on\nthat metric) measured by AutoLibra in these two categories roughly matches the score of\nthe Sotopia dimensions of the agent we studied. AutoLibra induces another four metrics\n8\n\nPreprint.

We note that\nthe other five dimensions in Sotopia are still valuable evaluation dimensions for social\nintelligence. However, behaviors captured by dimensions Financial and Material Benefits ,\nKnowledge , and Secret are often also captured by Goal Completion and Believability . As a result,\nAutoLibra produces the single Goal Achievement and Outcome Effectiveness by minimizing\nredundancy. Whereas, Relationship and Social Rules captures long-tailed behaviors not\ncaptured by AutoLibra.\n9\n\nPreprint. Under review.\nWebVoyager Similarly, for web navigation tasks, AutoLibra also discovers metrics such as\nAccess Barrier Handling ,Error Recovery and Adjustment ,Step Efficiency and Action Redundancy ,\nand Navigation Accuracy , which much more closely reflect concrete agent behavior than the\nfailure analysis categories proposed in previous work (He et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024c),\nwhere they are often simply classified as \u201cnavigation stuck\u201d. We also find additional metrics\nthat are not mentioned in the failure analysis, such as Query and Search Strategy Efficiency\nand Final Output and Summarization Quality , which are frequent issues (with frequencies\nof 7% and 18%). Since AutoLibra only observes the behavior of the agents, it cannot\ninterpret the neural representation, not able to capture the visual grounding issues, which\nare mentioned in the WebVoyager paper. This further demonstrates AutoLibra\u2019s utility\nin extracting behavior-salient metrics, and particularly demonstrates its ability to obtain\nfine-grained metrics that expert design would not have been able to extract.\n5 AutoLibra as a ladder\n : Agent improvement with AutoLibra\nBaba-Is-AI (5.1) WebVoyager (5.2)\nAvg.

We investigate two\nmethods for optimizing agents: prompt engineering and fine-tuning, across two domains:\ntext game and web browsing. Across all tested methods and domains, AutoLibra induces\nnew metrics in each iteration to cover emergent agent behaviors, and enables continuous\nimprovements on both induced metrics and task success. Fig. 8 illustrates the results.\n5.1 Can AutoLibra induce good optimization targets for prompt engineering?\nTo answer this question, we use Baba-Is-AI (Cloos et al., 2024; Paglieri et al., 2024) as a\ncase study, since it is not yet saturated by state-of-the-art LLM agents. This game requires\nmetacognitive skills, such as breaking and building new rules and planning ordered sub-\ntasks; a full list of game rules is listed in App. C. We use the top model on the leaderboard7\n(which when we started the experiments, was GPT-4o) (OpenAI et al., 2024) for the agent\npolicy, while we observe similar improvements in Claude-3.5-Sonnet8as well.\nTo avoid overfitting to the tasks used in optimization, we fine-tune on 6 of 40 tasks in Baba-\nIs-AI (Paglieri et al., 2024), but report performance on all 40 tasks. In one Iteration , the human\nprompt engineers (two of the authors) generate 18 agent trajectories (3 trajectories / task),\nuse AutoLibra to induce metrics, then optimize the prompt to achieve higher performance\non the induced metrics without considering the task success rate, and start a new iteration\nwhen one or more metrics improved significantly (over 30%). The procedure and experiment\nsetup are detailed in App. Alg. A and App. B.\nResults As shown in Fig. 8 and Tab. 3, the performance on Babaisai task increased from\n25% to 55% between Iteration 0 and Iteration 3 , with each iteration resulting in greater\n7https://balrogai.com\n8https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet\n10\n\nPreprint.

Among induced metrics (App.\nTab. 4), agent performance increases correspondingly to prompt changes targeting those\nmetrics, an example being Win Condition Recognition\n , which increases from 28% to\n50% from Iterations 0-1 after few-shot prompting (prompt in App. G) is introduced to teach\nthe identification of a win condition rule.

Under review.\nGeneralization to other models When replacing GPT-4o with Claude-3.5 as the LLM used\nin the agent (Appendix D), performance was found to be similar across all iterations, with\nheld-out task performance increasing by 20% to 55% between Iteration 0 and Iteration 3 and\nqualitatively similar trajectory performance and agent behaviors observed between the two\nLLMs. This demonstrates that the improvements realized by AutoLibra are generalizable to\nother LLMs, and that the induced metrics are robust to changes in the underlying LLM.\nGeneralization to other tasks To evaluate whether this pipeline can be generalized to\nother domains, we conduct the same pipeline to MiniHack (Samvelyan et al., 2021), an\nenvironment whose tasks and action space are more complex than Baba-Is-AI. Similarly to\nBaba-Is-AI, in three iterations, the task completion rate was observed to increase to 25%, an\nimprovement of 15% versus the baseline of 10%, validating AutoLibra\u2019s general utility in\nimproving agent performance; full results are available in the Appendices I-N.\n5.2 Can AutoLibra induce good optimization targets for agent fine-tuning?\nTo answer this question, we use web browsing (via the WebVoyager (He et al., 2024)\nbenchmark) to compare the effectiveness of AutoLibra with existing goal-oriented LLM-\nas-a-Judge methods in rejection behavior cloning methods for agent fine-tuning. We use a\ndiverse dataset (NNetNav-live) composed of agent trajectories of open-end exploration on\n20 live websites (Murty et al., 2025). NNetNav-live tasks are assigned a task label post-hoc,\nto ensure they have no overlap with and are more complex than the WebVoyager evaluation\ndatasets used in this subsection. Using the state-of-the-art agent Llama-8b-nnetnav-live,\nwhich was finetuned with trajectories selected with LLM-as-a-Judge instructed to evaluate\ntrajectories based on goal completion, and following a similar pipeline to \u00a75.1, we improve\nthe agents for 3 iterations, obtaining feedback on 18 trajectories in each iteration. Instead of\nprompt engineering, we use the induced metrics to choose the sampled trajectories with\ntop 10% sum scores of all metrics for fine-tuning the agent policy. Throughout the training\nprocedure, we use the tasks in NNetNav-live (Murty et al., 2025) for metric induction\nand agent finetuning. This process yields a 4.9% task completion rate improvement on\nWebVoyager, shown in Fig. 8 and Tab. 3, while using naive LLM-as-a-Judge instructed to\nevaluate goal completion does not yield significant improvement in metrics or success rate.\nThis shows that AutoLibra-induced metrics serve as better optimization targets than the\ngoal-oriented evaluation metric alone; theseinduced metrics are shown in App. Tab. 10.\n6 Related Work\nAutoLibra unifies three areas of research: it draws inspiration from thematic analysis to create\nnautral language-derived evaluation metrics to evaluate and reward AI agents .\nEvaluating AI agents Much of the work in AI agent evaluation focuses around benchmarks\nwhich contains both task suites and evaluation metrics. In addition to the datasets we used\nin this paper, SWE-Bench (Jimenez et al., 2024) uses human-written unit tests as evaluation\nmetrics; Embodied Agent Interface (Li et al., 2024) provides fine-grained evaluation for LLM-\nbased embodied agents; \u03c4-Bench (Yao et al., 2024) compares database states for evaluation;\nconcurrent work AgentRewardBench (L\u00f9 et al., 2025) builds a benchmark for reward models\nfor web agents. Recently, there are observatory tools including Galileo (Galileo, 2025), Vertex\nAI Gen AI (Cloud, 2025), and Docent (Meng et al., 2025) which provide user interfaces\nto visualize agent failure modes. Generating intrinsic rewards have also been studied in\nthe reinforcement learning community (Du et al., 2019; Pathak et al., 2017; Laskin et al.,\n2022) to encourage exploration, sub-task completion, or skill discovery. In contrast to these,\nAutoLibra is a pure data-driven task-agnostic method without predefined failure taxonomy\nfor generating interpretable metrics for agents.\nLearning from natural language and human feedback Researchers have been studying\nreinforcement learning with language feedback to provide a dense reward to agents (Goyal\net al., 2019). Since LLM agents are even harder to train with sparse reward, there is sub-\nstantial interest in training LLM agents from natural language feedback. Chen et al. (2024)\n12\n\nPreprint. Under review.\npropose an imitation learning method for learning from human feedback; Text2Reward\n(Xie et al., 2024) uses code generation to generate robot reward functions from open-ended\nhuman feedback; our work (Chen et al., 2025a) uses feedback to the improvement agent\npolicy with prompting and then align the unprompted agent policy with the prompted\none; Shi et al. (2024) propose a new model architecture to incorporate human feedback into\npolicy learning. On the other hand, human non-open-ended feedback is also incorporated\nin training agents, including rating feedback (Nguyen et al., 2017), preference feedback\n(Christiano et al., 2017), demonstrative feedback (Shaikh et al., 2025). Unlike these papers,\nAutoLibra induces metrics from feedback from all annotated instances and generates metrics\nthat are generalizable to different tasks and useful for both evaluation and agent fine-tuning.\nAutomatic thematic analysis Thematic analysis is a powerful tool for qualitative study\nthrough coding and iterative creation of themes. Gauthier & Wallace (2022) provide compu-\ntational tools to aid this process; Hong et al. (2022) and Gebreegziabher et al. (2023) explore\nhuman-AI collaboration in thematic analysis; LLooM (Lam et al., 2024), is an automatic\nmethod for concept induction, is closest to and influences our approach. This paper com-\npletes the loop of concept induction by using the meta-evaluation step to optimize the\ninduced metrics, and apply this social science technique to agent evaluation.\n7 Conclusion and Future Work\nIn this paper, we propose AutoLibra, a new paradigm for agent evaluation, one of the first\nworks to explore adaptable trajectory-derived evaluation heuristics, offering substantial\nadvantages in agent training over traditional end-to-end evaluation. We find that this\nframework is generalizable to a diverse range of agent tasks, provides new insights into\nagent behaviors, and identifies strong optimization targets for agent improvement. There\nare a few directions for further extending and applying this framework.\nBehavior-centric evaluation AutoLibra leads a paradigm shift from end-to-end agent evalua-\ntion (analogous to \u201cintegration tests\u201d in software development) to evaluation with granular\nmetrics that measure agents\u2019 concrete behaviors (analogous to \u201cunit tests\u201d). Future work\ncan study whether this process can be improved through better human-AI collaboration.\nSub-trajectory feedback from humans In AutoLibra, we label each trajectory with one piece\nof feedback, and ground it into the agents\u2019 concrete behavior which is at the sub-trajectory\nlevel. In the future, researchers can let users directly give feedback for one or multiple steps\nin the trajectory, which should lead to better feedback grounding results. Similarly, user\nfeedback can be collected during the interaction instead of after the agent has completed the\ntasks, which is a more user-friendly way to gather high quality feedback data.\nWider exploration of agent improvement methods In this paper, we only explored two\nmethods for agent improvement to show the utility of AutoLibra. In the future, researchers\ncan use AutoLibra to provide dense rewards for individual steps, and use reinforcement\nlearning to train LLM agents with these dense rewards.\nLimitation and Ethics Statement\nThe scope of this paper is text-based agents, which does not include agents with multimodal\nobservation or action spaces. Within human-aided experiments, we are also limited by\nthe diversity of human annotators. The annotation of the data in this paper, except for the\nfeedback collected by Shao et al. (2024), is done by the authors, who are experts in AI agents.\nWe do not address the effect of the experience of the annotators on the induced metrics.\nFinally, induced metrics should be used with caution, these could reflect the internal biases\nof the LLMs used to extract them.\n13\n\nPreprint.

Six representative\ntasks for baba-is-ai are used in to induce metrics within the AutoLibra pipeline, with the\nremaining 34 tasks held out for evaluation. The AutoLibra Ladder pipeline is evaluated on\nthe baba-is-ai and MiniHack environments; any changes to the agent code, the environment\nscore, trajectory performance, and other metrics are recorded at the end of each iteration.\nGPT-4o-241120 OpenAI et al. (2024) is used as the agent model in all experiments; the\nhuman-in-the-loop configuration of the AutoLibra pipeline is used.\nC Baba-is-ai Rules and Environment Configuration\nThis section discusses the rules and implementation details of Baba is AI, the task environ-\nment used in experiments in Section 4. Baba is AI is derived from Baba is You, a grid-based\npuzzle video game, and was originally implemented as part of the BALROG Paglieri et al.\n(2024) agent benchmark.\nBaba Is You is a puzzle game where the player controls a character that can navigate and\nmodify the rules of the game by pushing blocks containing words such as \u2019you\u2019, \u2019is\u2019 \u2019key\u2019,\nthat, when combined, define the game\u2019s rules.\nThe game field consists of a rectangular 4-connected grid with a number of objects, rules\nblocks, and obstacles present.\nWords (represented as rule blocks) can be combined to form sentences that define the\nproperties of objects, rules, and obstacles in the game, with rules becoming active when a\nfull sequence of rule blocks are joined in a 3-block line horizontally or vertically.\nActive rules are built in the form [<subject> <verb> <object>], where the subject and object\nare the names of objects in the game, and the verb is one of the following: \"is\", \"has\", \"can\",\nor \"not\".\nThe goal of the game is to reach a win condition, by manipulating the rules of the game\nto create new win conditions, modify the properties of objects, or change the behavior or\nidentity of the player character.\n20\n\nPreprint. Under review.\nFigure 9: Example of the baba-is-ai environment. In this task ( two_room-break_stop-make_win-\ndistr_obj-irrelevant_rule ), the agent has to break the \"wall is stop\" rule by pushing either\n\u2019wall\u2019, \u2019is\u2019, or \u2019stop\u2019 out of alignment with the other blocks, and must then push the \"key\"\nrule block next to \"is win\" at (9, 1) to assemble the win rule, then touch the key at (7, 7) to\nwin. Pushing the \"door\" rule block would be a mistake, as no door object is present.\nThe testing implementation we use is the baba-is-ai environment, a simplified version of\nBaba is You originally implemented within the BALROG agent benchmark Cloos et al.\n(2024); Paglieri et al. (2024). This implementation has several simplifications compared to\nthe original game, including a smaller grid size, fewer objects, and a limited set of rules.\nThe environment is designed to be easy to use and understand, while still providing a\nchallenging testbed for evaluating the performance of reinforcement learning agents on\nagentic reasoning tasks.\nA single baba-is-ai task is defined by an arbitrary rectangular grid where an exit condition\nmust be reached, with several possible obstacles and rules preventing the player from\nreaching the exit. Intermediate goals to achieving the exit condition can be defined by\nthe user, and the environment will generate a task that requires the agent to learn how to\nmanipulate the rules of the game in order to reach the exit. These intermediate goals are\nreferred to as \"subtasks\" within our paper, and include:\n\u2022Goto-Win : The agent must reach a specific location on the grid.\n\u2022Make-Win : The agent must create a new win condition by manipulating the rules\nof the game.\n\u2022Break-Stop : The agent must break or bypass a wall or obstacle in order to reach the\nexit.\n\u2022Change-You : The agent must change the identity of the player character in order to\nreach the exit, by modifying the \"baba is you\" rule.\nThese subtasks can be arbitrarily combined with distractor objects or rules, immovable game\nfield walls, and each other to generate tasks of varying complexity and length; baba-is-ai\nimplements 40 total unique tasks of gradually increasing difficulty.\nThe agent is provided observations in a text form, which includes the current state of the\ngame field, the currently active rules, and relative locations of obstacles to the active player\ncharacter in terms of shortest Manhattan distance. This is done to make the environment\ncompatible with purely text-based language models.\n21\n\nPreprint. Under review.\nThe agent is provided the space of possible actions it can take, which consist moving\none space in one of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), but is not given\ninformation about whether a given move will result in movement; it is thus free to move\ninto immovable walls without effect, to push rule blocks into corners where they cannot be\nmoved, or to make the task unsolvable by breaking the active \"baba is you\" rule without\ntaking control of a new object; in this last instance, the environment automatically resets the\ntask to a randomized beginning state for that task.\nThe environment is limited to 100 steps per task episode to avoid tasks being solved by\nrandom walks.\nD Baba-is-ai Experiment Results\nIteration 0 1 2 3 Baseline\nBabaisai Score GPT-4o 30% 40% 43% 55% 33%\nBabaisai Score GPT-4o (Only\nHeld-Out)33% 40% 44% 53% 33%\nBabaisai Score Claude 3.5 Sonnet 35% 40% 45% 55% 37%\nBabaisai Score Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n(Only Held-Out)38% 42% 47 % 58% 33%\nAverage Env.

Under review.\nF Baba-is-ai Metric Examples\nIteration 0: Context-Sensitive Decision Making\nExplanation:\nThis metric assesses the agent\u2019s capacity for context-sensitive decision making. It eval-\nuates whether the agent tailors its actions according to the immediate game condi-\ntions\u2014balancing between direct navigation and rule modification. Positive behaviors in\nnew environments will demonstrate an ability to determine when obstacles require inter-\nvention and when direct movement is sufficient, thereby optimizing overall efficiency.\nGood Behaviors:\n\u2022Accurately gauges the game context by recognizing when obstacles are not an\nissue\u2014such as when the win condition is already accessible\u2014and refrains from\nunnecessary rule modifications.\n\u2022Selects focused, goal-oriented actions that align with observed win conditions,\navoiding extraneous exploration.\n\u2022Adapts its strategy based on spatial layout and current rules, ensuring that its\nactions are timely and appropriate for the situation.\nBad Behaviors:\n\u2022Engages in excessive exploratory actions that do not contribute to reaching the\nwin condition.\n\u2022Repeatedly takes ineffective actions (for example, persistently moving into walls)\nbefore finally switching strategy, indicating delayed context-sensitive decisions.\n\u2022Alters irrelevant rules or diverts attention from the active win condition when\nthe situation does not demand it.\n\u2022Fails to adjust decision-making based on contextual cues, leading to uncoordi-\nnated or delayed progression toward the goal.\nIteration 1: Rule Modification for Obstacle Management\nExplanation:\nThis metric measures the agent\u2019s competence in managing obstacles through rule modifi-\ncations. It focuses on the agent\u2019s ability to detect when a game rule (such as a blocking\nwall or an unchangeable character assignment) is hindering progress and to successfully\nalter that rule to create a viable path to victory. In novel scenarios, agents displaying\npositive behavior will apply targeted rule changes that directly open the path toward the\nwin condition.\nGood Behaviors:\n\u2022Proactively breaks the \u2019wall is stop\u2019 rule when an obstacle blocks access to\nthe win condition.\n\u2022Effectively modifies rules\u2014such as replacing \u2019baba is you\u2019 with \u2019key\u2019 \u2014to\nremove or bypass obstacles.\nBad Behaviors:\n\u2022Fails to modify critical rule blocks (for instance, not altering \u2019baba is you\u2019 when\nrequired) that prevent access to the win condition.\n\u2022Does not interact with immovable obstacles like the \u2019wall is stop\u2019 rule, ne-\nglecting available mechanisms to bypass them.\n\u2022Neglects to rearrange rule blocks to create or build necessary win conditions\n(e.g., \u2019door is win\u2019 ), leaving obstacles unaddressed.\n23\n\nPreprint. Under review.\nIteration 2: Subtask Coordination and Overall Task Planning\nExplanation:\nThis metric assesses how well the agent coordinates multiple sub-tasks and plans its\noverall strategy. It rewards behaviors that demonstrate clear sequencing \u2013 from recog-\nnizing obstacles and manipulating rules to directly advancing toward the final objective.\nFailures in subtask coordination result in repetitive loops, ineffective transitions between\nactions, and an inability to achieve a meaningful win condition.\nGood Behaviors:\n\u2022 Final movement and approach towards \u2019ball\u2019 after removing the obstacle.\n\u2022 Direct movement between objectives as opposed to unrelated exploration.\n\u2022Throughout the trajectory, the agent repeatedly chooses actions that reduce the\ndistance to the door: moving left and down as needed.\n\u2022The trajectory demonstrates efficient movement towards the goal without un-\nnecessary actions.\n\u2022The trajectory shows direct movement to the door without redundant backtrack-\ning or circular movement.\n\u2022Throughout the trajectory, the agent follows a direct and purposeful path to-\nwards its goal.\nBad Behaviors:\n\u2022The trajectory shows multiple iterations of upwards movement resulting in no\nsignificant progress.\n\u2022In the trajectory, actions such as repeated \u2019left\u2019 moves where no significant\nprogress towards the goal is made.\n\u2022In over multiple steps, the agent moves unsuccessfully against immovable\nboundaries and objects.\n\u2022There are periods in the trajectory where the agent exhibits loops or repetitive\nmovements without advancing its position strategically.\n\u2022Ultimately, the agent\u2019s efforts to form victory conditions do not result in a\nmeaningful or achievable goal given the map\u2019s configuration.\n24\n\nPreprint. Under review.\nIteration 3: Interaction with Immovable Obstacles\nExplanation:\nThis metric measures how the agent handles immovable obstacles.

Under review.\nH Qualitative Observations of baba-is-ai Agent Performance\nThe metrics induced by AutoLibra (Table 4) capture the behavior of the agent effectively, with\ncoverage increasing from 65% at Iteration 0 to 92% at Iteration 3 and a low mean redundancy of\n56%. Notably, earlier metrics were found to describe higher-level behaviors than later metrics,\nreflective of the more complex behaviors that the agent demonstrated in later iterations, as\nwell as the compositionality of induced metrics. Code changes were selected to specifically\ntarget given metrics, and as seen in Figure 8, the agent\u2019s performance on the targeted metric\nimproved significantly in the iteration following the code change. This demonstrates the utility\nof AutoLibra for fine-grained agent improvement, as well as the human interpretability of the\ninduced metrics.\nThe section below discusses iteration-by-iteration induced metrics, code changes directed by the\nmetrics, and the results of these code changes on agent environment and trajectory performance.\nIteration 0 The agent behavior is stochastic and inconsistent, with no clear strategy or goal. Any\nprogress in the environment is the consequence of a random walk. Win Condition Recognition\nwas identified as a prerequisite to all other metrics induced in this iteration, as progress\nin the environment is impossible without recognizing the win condition, and was therefore\ntargeted for improvement. Improvements took the form of few-shot prompting, by supplying an\nexample of observations and the corresponding win condition and subtasks, and guidance on\nsubtask-level planning, by mapping specific environmental observations to actions that would\nprogress the agent towards the win condition. Iteration 1 An increase in\n performance\nof 22% was observed between Iteration 0 and Iteration 1 , indicating that the code changes were\neffective in improving the agent\u2019s ability to recognize the win condition. A slight but statistically\ninsignificant increase was observed for the other metrics induced in Iteration 0 , but the agent\u2019s\noverall baba-is-ai environment score increased by 10%, indicating that\n was correctly\nidentified by AutoLibra as a key bottleneck to the agent\u2019s performance in the environment.\nThe agent now targets specific blocks and objects instead of moving randomly, but gets stuck in\nloops and on immovable objects, and is unable to consistently complete multi-step tasks.\nBased on the metrics induced in Iteration 1 , several changes to the agent code were implemented:\n\u2022Augmentation of existing subtask-level planning guidance with low-level position\ninstructions, targeting improvement of Rule Modification for Obstacle Management\nand Direct Navigation Efficiency\n\u2022Meta-prompting Suzgun & Kalai (2024) by providing subtask identification heuristic,\ntargeting improvement of Selective Interaction with Relevant Objects\n and\nContext-Sensitive Decision Making\n\u2022Augmentation of single-shot example with movement instructions, targeting improve-\nment of Rule Manipulation and Execution\nIteration 2 Substantial improvements in\n were observed due to more detailed single-shot\nexamples and reasoning templates, and the corresponding increase in other metrics supports\nidea that\n is a key bottleneck to the agent\u2019s performance. We further observed a significant\nincrease in\n and\n , indicating that the changes targeting these metrics were effective in\nimproving the agent\u2019s reasoning performance and consequent avoidance of irrelevant objects.\nSubtask Identification\n saw no significant improvement, as the agent still misunderstands\nmap directions and confuses rule blocks with objects.\nQualitatively, the agent now recognizes when wall rules need to be broken and breaks them, but\nstill cannot assemble rules to win, as it gets stuck on immovable blocks and walls and does not\nunderstand where rule blocks need to be placed to form a win condition.\nBased on the metrics induced in Iteration 2 , several changes to the agent code were implemented:\n34\n\nPreprint.

The agent understands how to assemble win rules but still struggles with\nchanging block direction and understanding that blocks get stuck against walls.\n35\n\nPreprint. Under review.\nI MiniHack Rules and Environment Configuration\nFigure 10: Overview of representative tasks used in MiniHack agent optimization process\nwith AutoLibra. From left to right, up to down: (1) Boxoban , (2) MazeWalk , (3) Corridor Fight ,\nand (4) Quest .\nThis section discusses the rules and implementation details of MiniHack, another task envi-\nronment used in experiments in Section 4. Similarly to Baba is AI, MiniHack is derived from\na grid-based puzzle video game (NetHack), and was originally implemented as part of the\nBALROG Paglieri et al. (2024) agent benchmark.\nMiniHack is a grid navigation game expressed in text similar to baba-is-ai, consisting of a\nprocedurally generated environment that requires the agent to navigate a space consisting of\nvarious agent roles, creatures, items, and tasks to reach a goal Samvelyan et al. (2021). Given\nits plasticity and abundant elements, MiniHack is more complex, challenging, and diversified\nthan baba-is-ai; this is reflected in a lower success rate for agents on MiniHack versus Baba is\nAI, with a baseline agent task completion rate of 10% on MiniHack vs 33% on baba-is-ai Paglieri\net al. (2024).\nSimilar to our experiments with baba-is-ai, the Ladder improvement process for MiniHack\nalso follows the algorithm detailed in Appendix A. Two full iterations of agent improvement\nwith AutoLibra were performed on MiniHack. Four representative tasks for MiniHack are\nused in iterative metric improvement, with the remainder held out for evaluation. The agent is\nevaluated on the MiniHack environment and any changes to the agent code at the beginning\nof each iteration, and the environment score, trajectory performance, and other metrics are\nrecorded at the end of each iteration. GPT-4o-241120 is used as the agent model.\nThe four selected representative tasks each contain a unique subset of subtasks evaluating an\nagent\u2019s capability. Figure 10 shows an example for each task, and from left to right, up to down,\nthese maps respectively represent Boxoban, MazeWalk, Corridor Fight, and Quest.\nBoxoban is a box-pushing puzzle game inspired by Sokoban, rendered within the MiniHack\nenvironment. To succeed in Boxoban, the agent needs to push the four boulders (orange balls)\nonto the four fountains (blue icons), and partial credit will be awarded for pushing some of\nthe boulders onto the fountains. Boxoban tests the agent\u2019s capability in strategic planning and\nrule-following.\nMazeWalk is a game that requires the agent to explore unknown dark spaces to find\nthe target exit staircase (the icon with a downward arrow). Two challenges for MazeWalk are fog\nof war \u2013 the agent initially lacks information about areas of the map it hasn\u2019t visited, and must\nexplore to discover the map and maze layout, and darkness \u2013 even if the agent has visited a\nblock, the block will become \u2019dark\u2019 as the agent walks away and it passes out of view, retaining\ninformation about its layout but not any enemies or items present. Thus, MazeWalk tests the\nagent\u2019s capability in map memory and strategic searching.\nCorridor Fight is a game that requires the agent to explore an unknown dark corridor\nmap to find the target exit staircase while engaging or avoiding giant rat enemies. Corridor Fight\ntests the agent\u2019s capability in memory, space awareness, hazard awareness, and strategic combat.\n36\n\nPreprint. Under review.\nQuest requires the agent to use a tool to help itself cross an otherwise impassable wall\nof lava, survive randomly generated monsters, and search for the target exit staircase. As the\nmost subtask-rich and randomized game, it tests the agent\u2019s abilities to recognize and utilize\ntools, understand its role and special power, and strategically survive from monsters.\nIn all tasks, the agent is provided observations in a text form, which includes the current state\nof the game field, the currently active rules, and relative locations of obstacles to the active\nplayer character in terms of shortest Manhattan distance. This is done to make the environment\ncompatible with purely text-based language models.\nThe environment is limited to 100 steps per task episode to avoid tasks being solved by random\nwalks.\nJ MiniHack Experiment Results\nT urn 0 1 2 Baseline\nMiniHack Score GPT-4o 0% 12.5% 25% 10%\nAverage Env.

A substantial improvement in the agent\u2019s task completion performance is observed from\nIteration 1 toIteration 2 , with the agent achieving both a higher environment score and trajectory\nperformance on the held-out tasks compared to the baseline agent. Specifically, the agent\u2019s\nperformance on metrics increased correspondingly to code changes, like\n improving from 16.67%\nto 41.67%, demonstrating the utility of AutoLibra for fine-grained agent improvement. This is\ndiscussed in more detail in the following sections.\nN.1 Extracted Metrics and Improvements\nThe metrics induced by AutoLibra (Table 9) capture the behavior of the agent through all iterations,\nwith coverage of 83% at Iteration 0 to 88% at Iteration 2 . Due to the diversity of tasks, metrics pertain to\none or two tasks, matching the expectation that AutoLibra should generate fine-grained metrics.\nNotably, the metrics generated at Iteration 0 are nearly comprehensive as they demonstrate good\ncoverage of all four MiniHack tasks, while the later metrics were found to specifically describe\ndetailed behaviors for targeting one task each. Code changes were selected to specifically target\nimprovements in given metrics, and as seen in Table 8, the agent\u2019s performance on the targeted metric\nimproved significantly in the iteration following the code change. This demonstrates the utility of\nAutoLibra for fine-grained agent improvement, as well as the human interpretability of the induced\nmetrics. On the other hand, some metrics remain unchanged over iterations. The unchanged metrics\nare\n ,\n ,\n , and\n . These metrics are all tightly related to Boxoban or Quest environments.\nAs these two environments contain high level of randomness, interactions with system, and\nsophisticated planning, our prompt and example based guidance do not provide obvious\nimprovements. This result also indicates that simply coding might not be sufficient if the gap between\nthe agent\u2019s capability and the task\u2019s complexity is too significant.\nIteration 0 The agent\u2019s behavior is stochastic and repetitive, with no utilization of memory, planning,\nand goal awareness. Although the agent has reasoning before taking action, the decided action shows\nno correlation with the goal or the environment. Target Navigation Effectiveness\n was\nidentified as the core metric that evaluates the performance of all tasks except Boxoban. As all three\nother tasks require the agent to explore the target exit stairs,\n serves as the fundamental test of the\nagent\u2019s goal awareness for these tasks. Since Boxoban has a different winning condition, Boulder\nManipulation Strategy\n induced in this iteration targets describing the overall goal awareness for\n56\n\nPreprint. Under review.\nthe agent in Boxoban environment. The remaining four metrics each cover two to three tasks on a\nmore detailed level.\nBased on the metrics induced in Iteration 0 , several changes to the agent code were implemented:\n\u2022Augmentation of subtask-level behavioral restriction guidance with the single-shot example,\ntargeting improvement of Boulder Manipulation Strategy\n ,Combat Engagement and\nSurvival\n , and Hazard Awareness and Equipment Utilization\n .\n\u2022Meta-prompting by providing subtask instructions targeting improvement of Role-Specific\nAbility Utilization\n .\n\u2022 Augmentation of subtask-level winning strategy with few-shot example, targeting\nimprovement of Target Navigation Effectiveness\n and Efficient Exploration and\nMap Memory Utilization\n .\nIteration 1 The changes made after Iteration 0 did not yield substantial improvements in agent task\ncompletion performance, but behavior changes matching the metrics were observed and insights on\nprompt improvements were obtained. A decrease in\n performance of 8.3% was observed between\nIteration 0 and Iteration 1 , indicating that the code changes confuse the agent which reduces their\ncapability of goal recognition, and the same reduction is also observed for\n . Three causes of these\nreductions are recognized. Firstly, the overly simplified strategy for MazeWalk provides no positive\nintuitions for the agent when loops exist in the map. Secondly, the seemingly straightforward\nbehavioral restrictions with examples do not appear sufficient enough for the agent to avoid false\naction as the agent failed to comprehend the map thorough enough. Thirdly, the randomness of Quest\nis so high that existing guidance fails to cover new randomly generated situations. Based on Iteration\n1\u2019sresult, MazeWalk and Corridor Fight both appear solvable given a more optimal strategy, and\nQuest and Boxoban, given their high randomness and complexity, do not appear easily solvable, so\nproviding more examples seem to be the only direction of improvement. Moreover, two new metrics\nare induced, one focusing on Corridor Fight and the other focusing on Quest.\nBased on the metrics induced in Iteration 1 , new changes are listed below:\n\u2022 Augmentation of existing subtask-level advanced strategy with step-by-step\ndecision-making instructions and few-shot examples, targeting improvement of Target\nNavigation Effectiveness\n and Efficient Exploration and Map Memory Utilization\n.\n\u2022 Augmentation of existing subtask-level strategy with corner cases handling guidance and\nfew-shot examples, targeting improvement of Combat Engagement and Survival\n ,Hazard\nAwareness and Equipment Utilization\n , and Spatial Awareness and Interpretation\n.\n\u2022 Augmentation of existing few-shot examples with a full trajectory of the complete winning\ntask, targeting improvement of Boulder Manipulation Strategy\n .\n\u2022Meta-prompting by providing more in-depth subtask instructions, targeting improvement of\nRole-Specific Ability Utilization\n and Object Pickup Efficiency\n .\nIteration 2 We observe a significant increase in\n and\n indicating the code changes successfully\nimprove agent\u2019s ability in goal awareness and goal reaching efficiency. Based on task-level\nobservation, the agent succeeded in most MazeWalk and Corridor Fight tasks. The large increase in\nand\n shows the agent\u2019s strong performance in the Corridor Fight task. More specifically, the\nagent now demonstrates both the capability of choosing optimal action based on its current location\nand the capability of strategically handling dangerous enemies\u2014giant rats\u2014in an emergency. The\nnew induced metric also further proves the agent\u2019s rat-handling ability. For instance, when the agent\nencounters multiple rats at the same time, it will immediately retreat to the middle of the single-way\ncorridor to engage rats in combat individually. By doing so, the agent can easily beat rats one by one\nand navigate to the goal without danger. However, as all the remaining metrics show no\nimprovements, we also observe the agent\u2019s poor performance on Boxoban and Quest. This result\nshows that our current targeting improvement strategy of adding abundant few-shot examples does\nnot seem effective given the gap between the agent\u2019s reasoning ability and the high randomness and\ncomplexity of Boxoban and Quest. For example, despite more than ten examples of pushing a boulder\nto a dead corner, a prohibited behavior has been presented, the agent will still randomly push a\nboulder to the L-shaped dead corner formed by two walls which causes this boulder to become\nimmovable.\n57\n\nPreprint. Under review.\nN.2 Held-Out Task Performance\nFor the held-out tasks, the agent task completion rate improved from Iteration 0 toIteration 2 , with\nscores from 0% to 25%. This result further proves that the improvements realized by AutoLibra are\ngeneralizable to unseen tasks. However, some failed cases also provide valuable insights into\nprospective future iterations. For instance, the complete set of Corridor tasks consists of scenarios\nwhere the target downstairs may be located west of the agent\u2019s starting point, unlike Corridor Fight,\nwhere the target always lies to the east. Consequently, an instruction that rigidly directs the agent to\nexplore only eastward fails to generalize to the broader Corridor tasks. This outcome underscores the\nimportance of crafting instructions that are specific yet flexible: they should provide sufficiently\ndetailed, high-level strategies without relying on overly prescriptive, task-specific steps. By focusing\non generalizable principles rather than rigid directions, the agent is better equipped to adapt to a\nwider range of scenarios while still benefiting from structured guidance. The agent\u2019s performance on\nthe held-out tasks is shown in Table 7.\nO NNetNav-Live Induced Metrics\nIt.

One of the major challenges in RAG is the need for\nstrong self-awareness of its knowledge boundaries. In a closed-\nbook reasoning setting, all knowledge is embedded inside the LLM\nand remains inherently static, regardless of how the problem is\ndecomposed or how a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is structured. In\ncontrast, RAG involves external augmented information accessed\nthrough retrieval, potentially shifting the system\u2019s internal knowl-\nedge boundary. Furthermore, retrieval adds additional complexity\nand uncertainty, which may accumulate over extended reasoning\nsequences in multi-round RAG systems.\nHuman intelligence addresses this issue through meta-cognition\n(i.e., knowing when you don\u2019t know) [ 4,21]. Humans can contin-\nuously assess their knowledge boundaries and adapt their search\nbehaviors as needed in dynamic information environments, such\nas when using a search engine. After reviewing retrieved results\nat each time point, humans assess whether sufficient information\nhas been gathered, decide whether further search is necessary, and\nissue new queries to better address the current information needs.\nMeta-cognition is challenging for LLMs due to their noise sensi-\ntivity and limited self-awareness of knowledge boundaries [ 10,21].\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, systems that rely on an LLM to decidearXiv:2505.02811v1  [cs.AI]  5 May 2025\n\nSIGIR \u201925, July 13\u201318, 2025, Padua, Italy.

This figure illustrates two typical patterns that hurt performance: Over-Confidence (e.g., stopping\ntoo early, as seen in 0 and 1 Round RAG, where the system provides an incorrect answer based on limited context) and\nOver-Retrieval (e.g., retrieving unnecessary information in 3 Rounds RAG which introduces a long and overly complex context\nthat confuses the LLM and leads to incorrect answers.).\nthe number of retrieval rounds make two types of errors: Over-\nConfidence, resulting in incorrect answers from insufficient in-\nformation, and Over-Retrieval, where excessive and distracting\ninformation confuses the LLM. Thus, a core problem for multi-\nround RAG is knowing you don\u2019t know so that a system can either\ncontinue searching only if it is necessary or refrain from answering\nwhen the available information is insufficient to support a credible\nresponse. As an underexplored problem, recent research either re-\nquires a large amount of costly human-labeled supervision data [ 45]\nor produces suboptimal performance [1].\nThe optimization of a RAG system often employs outcome super-\nvision to directly align the initial input with the final output [ 7,18].\nWhile outcome supervision with simple question-answer (QA) pairs\nhas proven effective for single-step RAG [ 2,11], when an LLM can\nrapidly learn to map a question to its direct answer or query, it\nappears inadequate for learning the optimal reasoning path in a\nmulti-round RAG setting, when the answer or next-round query is\ncontext-dependent over rounds.\nMachine Learning researchers have recently found that pro-\ncess supervision is a promising alternative to outcome supervision\nfor enhancing self-awareness in complex reasoning tasks at the\ninference time thinking stage [ 17,20,25]. With a well-trained re-\nward model from human-labeled CoT data, optimization can be\nperformed by explicitly supervising intermediate reasoning steps\nvia parameter tuning or training-free verbal reinforcement learn-\ning (RL) [ 23,31,44]. An early attempt from the IR community,\nIM-RAG [ 45], has explored process supervision for multi-round\nRAG by simulating the human Inner Monologue reasoning process\n(i.e., multi-round self-talk within one\u2019s mind). It optimizes each\nmid-step query or answer via actor-critic RL [ 16]. Despite its strong\nperformance, the training relies on expensive human-annotated\nsupporting documents to generate multi-round reasoning and re-\ntrieval training data (i.e., information-seeking chains with labels).\n2In this figure, the multi-round RAG refers to a system that relies on LLM to determine\nhow many rounds of retrieval are needed, including 0, 1, or multiple rounds.The lack of labeled training data is the main challenge in widely\napplying process supervision to RAG. Unlike other LLM tasks, such\nas coding or mathematical reasoning, annotating gold reasoning\nchains in RAG tasks is difficult because different LLMs may have var-\nied internal knowledge, leading to distinct information needs even\nin the same context. Thus, human-annotated, LLM-independent\ninformation-seeking chains may not align with an LLM\u2019s behavior\nand knowledge, making high-quality multi-round RAG training\ndata costly to label.\nThis work addresses the labeled data shortage problem when\nadapting process supervision to multi-round RAG systems. We\npropose SIM-RAG (Self-practicing for Inner Monologue-based\nRetrieval Augmented Generation), a practical multi-round frame-\nwork that can be learned through two stages. First, in the Self-\nPracticing stage, we generate synthetic process supervision data\nby distilling the system\u2019s inner monologues and corresponding\nprocess labels. This inner monologue captures the system\u2019s internal\ncomplex reasoning trajectory across its components and can also be\ninterpreted as a form of dynamic reasoning chain. Unlike synthetic\ndata generation using the strongest models, which focuses on pro-\nducing near-human quality data [ 37], Self-Practicing generates data\nreflecting the given AI system\u2019s capability. Then, during the Critic\nTraining stage, we use the generated data to train a Critic, which\nis system-specific and context-aware. When a SIM-RAG system\nis used at inference time, the Critic repeatedly checks the knowl-\nedge boundary based on available information and provides process\nsupervision to optimize LLM\u2019s behavior via in-context RL [ 31], alle-\nviating Over-Confidence and Over-Retrieval problems. In summary,\nour contributions are as follows:\n\u2022To simulate human-like meta-cognition in complex reason-\ning, we propose the SIM-RAG framework, which contin-\nuously assesses the system\u2019s knowledge boundaries and\nadapts its search behaviors accordingly. By using informa-\ntion sufficiency as a guiding principle for process supervision,\nSIM-RAG enhances the inference-time thinking capabilities\n\nKnowing You Don\u2019t Know: Learning When to Continue Search in Multi-round RAG through Self-Practicing SIGIR \u201925, July 13\u201318, 2025, Padua, Italy.\nof LLMs, enabling dynamic, multi-round retrieval and rea-\nsoning for complex tasks.\n\u2022To address the data challenges for RAG system training,\nwe introduce the Self-Practicing Algorithm (Algorithm 1).\nThis algorithm generates synthetic training data, provid-\ning a lower-cost alternative to human-annotated supporting\ndocuments or labeled information-seeking chains, and pro-\nducing training data that more accurately reflects the given\nAI system\u2019s current capabilities.\n\u2022Our experiments on three standard benchmarks show that\nSIM-RAG is a lightweight and effective solution, capable\nof robust performance on complex reasoning tasks across\ndiverse question-answering scenarios.\n2 RELATED WORK\n2.1 Retrieval Augmented Generation\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language\nmodels (LLMs) by retrieving external knowledge during inference,\naddressing limitations such as reliance on fixed pre-trained knowl-\nedge bases and susceptibility to hallucinations [ 5]. Pre-trained LLMs\noften lack up-to-date or domain-specific information, while hallu-\ncinations arise when the model generates plausible but incorrect\ncontent. By incorporating external retrieval, RAG enables more\naccurate and grounded responses. In standard RAG systems, also\nknown as single-round RAG, the retrieval process involves using\nthe user\u2019s question or an LLM-generated query to search a knowl-\nedge base [ 2,11,28]. These systems are effective for tasks with\nstraightforward information needs, where the required information\nis fully available in a single retrieval step and does not depend on\niterative reasoning or multiple rounds of interaction.\nHowever, many real-world tasks involve dynamic and complex\nreasoning, where the required information cannot be retrieved in a\nsingle step. For instance, answering a question may require synthe-\nsizing information from multiple documents, clarifying ambiguities,\nor filling gaps in the initial retrieval. In such cases, single-round\nRAG systems fall short, as they lack mechanisms to iteratively re-\nfine their retrieval and reasoning strategies [ 38]. This has motivated\nthe development of multi-round retrieval and reasoning systems.\n2.2 Multi-Round RAG\nMulti-round RAG has shown great potential for tackling tasks in-\nvolving dynamic and complex reasoning, where iterative inter-\nactions with external knowledge sources are necessary to refine\nresponses. However, a core challenge in multi-round RAG is de-\ntermining information sufficiency\u2014deciding when the retrieved\ninformation is adequate to answer the query or if further retrieval\nsteps are required [ 35,45]. Existing works on multi-round RAG\nhave explored various techniques to address this challenge.\nTraining-free system. Training-free methods have gained pop-\nularity due to their flexibility and ease of deployment, as they do\nnot require task-specific optimization and can be seamlessly inte-\ngrated into existing pipelines. These systems rely on the inherent\ncapabilities of LLMs to determine when retrieval should stop. One\napproach involves reflection-based self-critique [ 31,38], where the\nmodel evaluates its own knowledge through carefully designedprompts or in-context learning [ 39,41]. This technique leverages\nthe strong pre-trained knowledge of LLMs and allows the use of\nany LLM as a reasoning backbone. However, it is inherently con-\nstrained by the limitations of the underlying model, including a\ntendency to generate hallucinations or over-confident but incorrect\nresponses [ 33,46]. Some methods take advantage of the internal\nstates of LLMs, such as token-level attention weights [ 35] or confi-\ndence scores [ 48], to decide retrieval sufficiency. These signals can\noffer insights into the model\u2019s reasoning process, but often require\naccess to model weights and, consequently, cannot be used with\nclosed-source LLMs. Additionally, the lack of interpretability in\nlatent representations undermines trustworthiness, making these\nsignals less suitable for applications [ 42] such as healthcare, where\ntrustworthiness plays a critical role.\nRecent studies have explored the use of well-trained models,\nsuch as GPT-4, as reward models [ 24]. However, this approach re-\nmains constrained by the inherent pre-training biases of the reward\nmodel due to the absence of task-specific optimization [ 34]. More\nbroadly, the lack of training presents a double-edged sword: while it\nsimplifies deployment and enhances ease of use, it simultaneously\nrestricts the potential for further performance improvement\nLearnable framework. Several learning frameworks for multi-\nround RAG have been proposed in the past two years. A recent\nwork trains a classifier to categorize the difficulty of user queries\ninto three classes [ 12], and applies different retrieval strategies\nto each class: no retrieval for simple queries, single-step retrieval\nfor medium-difficult queries, and IR-CoT [ 38] for complex queries.\nSince this approach primarily focuses on choosing different re-\ntrieval strategies, it is not directly comparable to our work. Instead,\nwe used IR-CoT as one of our baselines. Self-RAG [ 1] is inspired\nby the concept of Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback\n(RLHF) [ 26]. It first trains a separate critic model using high-quality\ndata to evaluate information sufficiency and then fine-tunes the\nLLM model in full size, equipping it with self-critique capabilities.\nMoreover, instead of standard online RLHF, Self-RAG uses outcome\nsupervision [ 20] to generate sequences of text that include spe-\ncial tokens to trigger retrieval operations. Although this method\nshows potential, its substantial data and computational costs limit\nits practicality for deployment and domain-specific adaptation [ 43].\nRecently, the Machine Learning community has shown that pro-\ncess supervision [ 20], which supervises intermediate reasoning\nsteps, can significantly improve multi-step reasoning tasks com-\npared to outcome supervision [ 17]. Motivated by these findings, IR\nresearchers proposed IM-RAG [ 45], a framework that employs re-\ninforcement learning via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [ 29]\nto jointly optimize the reasoning chain and retrieval queries (i.e.,\nlearning the model\u2019s inner monologue) in multi-round RAG. IM-\nRAG has shown notable performance improvements. However, the\nmethod faces challenges in broader applicability due to its reliance\non costly annotated support documents to define dataset-specific\nrule-based reward functions, and it lacks a principled mechanism\nfor determining when to terminate the retrieval process.\n2.3 LLM Self-Training for Complex Reasoning\nWith the increasing need for fresh data, recent advancements in\npost-training have shifted the focus toward using model-generated\n\nSIGIR \u201925, July 13\u201318, 2025, Padua, Italy.

In this\nparadigm, LLMs generate multiple outputs for a given input and use\na reward signal to identify and train on high-quality samples [ 52].\nThis iterative process enables models to improve their reasoning\ncapability without relying exclusively on human-labeled data.\nAdapting self-training to RAG has some new complications com-\npared with pure language tasks (e.g., commonsense reasoning),\nwhich rely on static knowledge embedded within an LLM. In a\nmulti-round RAG setting, newly retrieved information changes the\nknowledge boundary at each turn, the additional information can\neither support or hinder subsequent reasoning, and errors in early\nretrieval can propagate through later stages due to the sensitivity\nof LLMs to noisy contexts [ 27]. Optimizing self-awareness in RAG\nsystems requires determining whether the current knowledge is\nadequate (when to retrieve) and issuing effective queries to acquire\nadditional information that meets the current needs (what to re-\ntrieve). Because the knowledge boundary changes over turns and\nnoise is added, multi-round RAG requires a higher level of self-\nawareness in the cognitive hierarchy [ 21] compared to multi-step\nreasoning tasks with static knowledge. This work tries to solve\nthese unique challenges RAG systems face during self-training.\nPractitioners have used LLM for self-critique when self-training,\ninternalizing the critique capability. However, the research commu-\nnity is questioning whether LLM truly has enough self-awareness\nto satisfy self-critique [ 10,33,34]. Motivated by these findings, we\nchoose to use an external Critic rather than self-critique. SIM-RAG\nemploys a lightweight Critic that remains unattached from the LLM\nand is trained on a single task: checking the information sufficiency.\n3 METHODOLOGY\nThis section introduces the SIM-RAG framework, outlining its de-\nsign in Section 3.1. We then provide an in-depth explanation oftwo core stages for framework training: Self-Practicing for inner\nmonologue distillation and labeling (Section 3.2) and Critic training\n(Section 3.3). Finally, we elaborate on the overarching rationale for\nthe framework\u2019s design and its inference methodology (Section 3.4).\n3.1 SIM-RAG\nThe overview of the SIM-RAG framework is illustrated in Figure 2,\nfollowing the information flow during the inference-time thinking\nprocess. The system comprises three main components: (1) a Rea-\nsoner (an LLM) that generates queries or provides answers based\non the context; (2) a Retriever (e.g., a search engine) that retrieves\ndocuments given the Reasoner\u2019s query; and (3) a learnable Critic\n(a lightweight discriminative model) that identifies when the Rea-\nsoner\u2019s current knowledge and reasoning are insufficient. As a fully\nmodularized system, SIM-RAG organizes these components into\nthree functional modules, described as follows in the order they are\nused during inference.\nAnswer Generation. In this stage, the Reasoner (LLM) receives\nthe initial question or task \ud835\udc44from the user and any available con-\ntext\ud835\udc36from previous retrieval steps (an empty string at turn 0). The\nReasoner produces an answer \ud835\udc34\u2032and a corresponding rationale \ud835\udc5f.\nAlthough the context is initially empty, the Reasoner benefits in sub-\nsequent turns from an accumulated context containing prior search\nqueries and retrieved documents. The Reasoner\u2019s objective at this\nstage is to produce its best-guess answer based on all information\ncurrently available. Thus, the model chosen for the Reasoner can\nbe any language model capable of answering questions, provided\nit can generate an answer and a rationale in natural language that\ncan later be evaluated by the Critic.\nSufficiency Inspection. In complex reasoning problems, humans\ncan continuously assess whether they have sufficient information\n\nKnowing You Don\u2019t Know: Learning When to Continue Search in Multi-round RAG through Self-Practicing SIGIR \u201925, July 13\u201318, 2025, Padua, Italy.\nand a correct answer as they progress through a long reasoning\nchain. This ability, known as meta-cognition, enables individuals\nto monitor and support their reasoning throughout the thinking\nprocess.\nSIM-RAG employs a Critic to simulate a similar meta-cognitive\nfunction. After receiving the Reasoner\u2019s proposed answer-rationale\npair(\ud835\udc34\u2032,\ud835\udc5f), the Critic examines them alongside the initial question\n\ud835\udc44and the retrieved documents contained in the current context \ud835\udc36.\nIf the Critic determines that the answer \ud835\udc34\u2032is adequately supported\nby the evidence from (\ud835\udc44,\ud835\udc36,\ud835\udc5f), the system returns \ud835\udc34\u2032as the final\nanswer to the user. If the Critic judges \ud835\udc34\u2032to be insufficient, due to\nlack of information, inadequate support from retrieved data, incon-\nsistencies with known facts, or similar issues, the system discards\nthe current attempt and proceeds to the Information Retrieval mod-\nule. This design helps prevent the propagation of flawed reasoning\npaths by ensuring that only well-supported answers are returned\nto the user.\nInformation Retrieval. After the Critic determines that the Rea-\nsoner is unable to answer the question based on all available infor-\nmation, the system triggers the Information Retrieval module. The\nReasoner generates a search query \ud835\udc5ebased on the user\u2019s question\nand the current context. This query is then passed to the Retriever,\nwhich returns the most relevant external knowledge. Both the\nsearch query and the returned documents are appended to the \ud835\udc36,\nwhich will be fed into the next round of Answer Generation. By in-\ntegrating newly retrieved information, the Reasoner may be better\nequipped to converge on a well-supported answer in subsequent\niterations. Notably, the Reasoner in this stage is flexible and could\nbe the same or a different LLM used in the Answer Generation\nblock. For simplicity, and without loss of generality, we used the\nsame LLM to generate both queries and answers in our experiments.\nHowever, in practice, LLMs optimized for each functionality may\nresult in better performance, as developing a good answer may\nrequire different abilities from issuing a good query [45].\nIterative Framework. After updating the context \ud835\udc36, the system\nloops back to the Answer Generation stage, with the newly re-\ntrieved information helping to expand the Reasoner\u2019s knowledge\nboundary. This iterative process, consisting of three steps per it-\neration, simulates a human-like search and reasoning loop that\ncontinually reevaluates the adequacy of its current explanation\nand dynamically seeks additional information as needed. The An-\nswer Generation, Sufficiency Inspection, and Information Retrieval\nsteps repeat until the Critic determines the answer is sufficiently\ngrounded or the maximum number of iterations is reached to pre-\nvent an infinite loop. This cyclical, meta-cognitive design aims to\nmaximize the correctness and completeness of the final response.\n3.2 Self-Practicing\nOur training pipeline starts with collecting training data for the\nsupervised learning of the Critic. Given the Critic\u2019s task, the train-\ning data should consist of information-seeking chains with accurate\nlabels and include sufficient quantity and diversity, enabling the\nCritic to learn how to assess mid-step information sufficiency and\nevaluate the correctness of the current answer in real-world sce-\nnarios. However, as discussed in Section 1, information sufficiencyAlgorithm 1 Self-Practicing Algorithm. Description. This algo-\nrithm generates labeled inner monologue data by enabling the RAG\nsystem to perform self-practice. It automatically searches, attempts\nto generate answers, and checks whether the generated answer for\neach sequence of actions is correct.\n1:Notation:\n2:IR: Information Retriever\n3:R: Reasoner LLM\n4:\ud835\udc44: Question\n5:\ud835\udc34: Ground-truth Answer\n6:\ud835\udc36: Empty list to track the context\n7:\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc61: Search query from LLM at the \ud835\udc61-th turn\n8:\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61: Retrieved document at the \ud835\udc61-th turn\n9:\ud835\udc5f: Rationale\n10:\ud835\udc34\u2032: LLM generated answer\n11:\ud835\udc47: Maximum number of turns allowed\n12:foreach data point do\n13:\ud835\udc36\u2190\u2205,\ud835\udc56\u21900 // initialize context and turn counter\n14: while t < T do\n15:(\ud835\udc34\u2032,\ud835\udc5f)\u2190R(\ud835\udc44,\ud835\udc36) // generate answer and rationale\n16: if\ud835\udc34\u2032=\ud835\udc34then\n17: Record{\ud835\udc44,\ud835\udc36,\ud835\udc34\u2032,\ud835\udc5f}with critique label Accept\n18: else\n19: Record{\ud835\udc44,\ud835\udc36,\ud835\udc34\u2032,\ud835\udc5f}with critique label Reject\n20: end if\n21:\ud835\udc61\u2190\ud835\udc61+1\n22:\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc61\u2190R(\ud835\udc44,\ud835\udc36) // generate retrieval query\n23:\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61\u2190IR(\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc61) // retrieve document\n24:\ud835\udc36\u2190\ud835\udc36\u222a{\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61} // update context\n25: end while\n26:end for\nis subject to the LLM\u2019s knowledge and other available information.\nThus, human-labeled, model-agnostic information-seeking chains\nmay not match the real information-seeking behavior of an LLM\nwhose internal knowledge scope does not align with the annotator\u2019s.\nTo address this, we propose an approach to generate model-specific\nand context-aware synthetic data instead of real human-annotated\ndata. Specifically, we let the RAG system self-practice a multi-round\nretrieval process to find the correct answer for a given question\nwhere the target answer is known. During this practice, the real\ninteraction between the Reasoner and the Retriever enables us to\ncollect and label inner monologue data.\nAs shown in Algorithm 1, the Self-Practicing Algorithm requires\nonly a source dataset containing the initial question \ud835\udc44and the\nfinal answer \ud835\udc34, which are readily available in most existing QA\ndatasets. The augmented information is tracked by the context\nlist\ud835\udc36, initialized as an empty list (line 13). For each data point, an\niterative process simulates inner monologue between the Reasoner\nRand search engine IR. In the\ud835\udc61-th round, given all currently\navailable information (i.e., embedded knowledge of LLM and the\naugmented retrieved information \ud835\udc36), the Reasoner generates an\nanswer\ud835\udc34\u2032and rationale \ud835\udc5ffor the question \ud835\udc44(line 15). A correctness\ncheck between \ud835\udc34and\ud835\udc34\u2032determines whether the critique label \ud835\udc66for\nthe data tuple \ud835\udc65={\ud835\udc44,\ud835\udc36,\ud835\udc34\u2032,\ud835\udc5f}should be Accept orReject (line 17\nand 19). Regardless of the label, one data point is generated, and the\n\nSIGIR \u201925, July 13\u201318, 2025, Padua, Italy. Diji Yang et al.\nprocess continues. For each raw ( \ud835\udc44,\ud835\udc34) pair, the algorithm generates\n\ud835\udc47training data points of varying chain lengths and labels, where \ud835\udc47is\na predefined maximum number of turns (i.e., rounds of answering).\nIf the exit condition is unmet, the Reasoner is re-prompted with \ud835\udc44\nand\ud835\udc36to generate a search query \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc61(line 22). The search engine IR\nis then called to retrieve passages/documents \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61given the query\n\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc56(line 23). Next, the context is updated by concatenating the new\nquery and document, \ud835\udc36=\ud835\udc36\u222a{\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61}, before the next iteration\n(line 24).\nAs a result, given a source dataset with \ud835\udc41question-answer pairs,\nthe Self-Practicing Algorithm generates an augmented training set\nD={(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)}\ud835\udc40\n\ud835\udc56=1, where\ud835\udc40=\ud835\udc41\u00d7\ud835\udc47is the size ofD. The gener-\nated data is annotated with current answer correctness ( Accept\norReject ) and entails information sufficiency for a given LLM\nunder a multi-round RAG setting. Note that each generated data\npoint simulates a sequence of a RAG system\u2019s behavior, with either\npositive or negative critique labels. This differs from standard LLM\nknowledge distillation methods, which treat all distilled data points\nas positive training examples. Moreover, the same raw ( \ud835\udc44,\ud835\udc34) pair\ncan generate different sequences of RAG behaviors and correspond-\ning labels across iterations when the available information changes.\nThis increases both the quantity and diversity of the synthetic data.\n3.3 Reasoning-Enhanced Critic Learning\nThe Critic\u2019s task is formulated as a straightforward binary clas-\nsification problem for a given input \ud835\udc65. While any classification\nalgorithms could be used, we use pre-trained language models in\nthis work due to their superior semantic understanding capabilities.\nThus, the Critic training is to tune a generative language model by\ncasting the classification task as a conditional generation problem.\nGiven the training set D={(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)}\ud835\udc40\n\ud835\udc56=1from Section 3.2, we\nfollow the conception of instruction fine-tuning and first update\nthe input\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56to be the concatenation of general language instruction\nand task-specific input. During the training, the Critic is expected to\npredict the next token \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56given input\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56; thus, the training objective\nis to maximize the conditional likelihood of the binary labels (i.e.\ntargeted tokens), as shown in Equation 1, where \ud835\udf03is the language\nmodel parameters.\n\ud835\udf03\u2217=arg max\n\ud835\udf03logL(\ud835\udf03)=arg max\n\ud835\udf03\u2211\ufe01\n(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56)\u223cD[log\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56;\ud835\udf03)](1)\nThrough task-specific fine-tuning, the Critic quickly learns to\nmake predictions from a large amount of labeled IM-distilled data.\n3.4 Reasoning-Enhanced Inference\nThe goal of this section is to justify and elaborate on how the mech-\nanism introduced in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 improves RAG\u2019s output by\nleveraging the Critic\u2019s meta-cognitive feedback. The integration of\nthe trained Critic with the Reasoner and Retriever transforms SIM-\nRAG into an iterative reasoning framework, enabling it to dynami-\ncally refine responses based on feedback. The supervision of the\nLLM-based Reasoner over multiple rounds is verbal Reinforcement\nLearning (RL), where the Critic provides supervision in natural\nlanguage ( Accept orReject ) rather than numerical rewards or\ngradient updates. Analogous to traditional policy-based RL setups,\nthis verbal reinforcement defines a policy as a combination of theagent\u2019s memory encoding and the selected LLM parameters [ 31].\nWithin our framework, this approach leverages the strengths of\nin-context learning [ 3], as the Reasoner can interpret and incor-\nporate the Critic\u2019s feedback directly into its reasoning process by\nappending it to the input of the Reasoner. This in-context RL mech-\nanism enables the Reasoner to dynamically adapt its behavior and\ndecision-making process based on \ud835\udc44and\ud835\udc36, including the supervi-\nsion provided by the Critic, without requiring explicit parameter\nupdates. This preserves the system\u2019s modularity and keeps training\nlightweight. By grounding iterative refinement in textual feedback,\nthe framework encourages targeted improvements in reasoning\npaths and retrieval strategies.\nFrom the system design perspective, SIM-RAG separates the\nCritic from the Reasoner to avoid self-critique bias. During inference\ntime, the iterative cycle of feedback and context updates mirrors\nhuman reasoning under uncertainty, where gaps in knowledge are\nidentified and addressed step-by-step.\n4 EXPERIMENTS\n4.1 Task and Datasets\nTo comprehensively evaluate SIM-RAG across tasks of varying\nreasoning complexity, we conduct experiments on three highly\ndistinct datasets covering single-hop and multi-hop QA tasks. For\nsingle-hop QA, we use TriviaQA [ 15], a widely used benchmark\nthat focuses on factoid questions requiring reasoning over a sin-\ngle piece of evidence from Wikipedia. For multi-hop QA, we use\nHotpotQA [ 47] and 2WikiMultiHopQA [ 8]. HotpotQA requires\nsynthesizing information from multiple documents to answer com-\nplex questions, while 2WikiMultiHopQA focuses on distinguishing\nclosely related entities and incorporating fine-grained evidence.\nThese datasets challenge SIM-RAG\u2019s capabilities in multi-round\nretrieval and reasoning over insufficient information. Following\nthe standard evaluation methods, we report Exact Match (EM) and\nF1 scores for all datasets, using the Wikimedia dumps provided by\neach dataset as the retrieval corpus.\n4.2 Implementation Details\nWe evaluate two versions of SIM-RAG using Llama3-8B and GPT-4\nas the Reasoner. To fine-tune the Critic, we use two Flan-T5 mod-\nels of different sizes, corresponding to two versions of SIM-RAG:\nFlan-T5-2.85B for the full version (SIM-RAG full) and Flan-T5-783M\nfor the lightweight version (SIM-RAG lite). To ensure consistency\nwith other well-known RAG frameworks, we use BM25 with Elas-\nticsearch as the retriever across all experiments. Our pipeline can\nbe replicated with two NVIDIA 3090 GPUs or equivalent hard-\nware. We consider prompts, in-context examples, and the number\nof documents retrieved as hyperparameters and report them in our\nopen-sourced code base to facilitate reproducibility.\n4.3 Baselines\nWe compared SIM-RAG with eight baseline methods (Table 1). Naive\nGeneration [ 14] and Standard RAG [ 14] are two basic methods.\nNaive Generation fully relies on the internal knowledge of the LLM\nwithout using any retrieval, whereas Standard RAG uses the initial\nquestion as a query to retrieve documents, which are then used to\naugment the LLM\u2019s response through prompting. We report the\n\nKnowing You Don\u2019t Know: Learning When to Continue Search in Multi-round RAG through Self-Practicing SIGIR \u201925, July 13\u201318, 2025, Padua, Italy.\nTriviaQA HotPotQA 2Wiki\nMethod LLM/Retriever EM F1 EM F1 EM F1\n(a)Prompting\nNaiveGen [14] Llama3 55.7 63.1 20.0 28.4 26.4 33.9\nStandardRAG [ 14]Llama3/E5 58.9 68.3 25.1 35.3 8.6 21.0\nSEAKR [48] Llama2/BM25 42.6 48.6 27.9 39.7 30.2 36.0\nDRAGIN [35] Llama2/BM25 54.4 62.3 23.7 34.2 22.4 30.0\nLearned\nSelf-RAG [1]* Llama3/E5 38.2 53.4 17.1 29.6 12.1 25.1\nAuto-RAG [49]* Llama3/E5 56.7 60.7 31.9 44.3 38.8 46.9\n(b)Prompting\nNaiveGen [14] GPT-4 59.6 70.0 27.5 37.9 23.7 31.7\nStandardRAG [ 14]GPT-4/BM25 60.3 65.9 35.7 45.5 28.7 33.8\nFLARE [13]* Llama3/E5 55.8 63.2 19.7 28.0 25.8 33.9\nIR-CoT [38]* Llama3/BM25 56.4 68.9 28.6 39.1 23.5 31.8\nLearned\nSIM-RAG lite Llama3/BM25 69.2 74.5 27.8 37.9 32.1 38.0\nSIM-RAG lite GPT-4/BM25 77.3 82.8 37.0 49.7 44.5 53.3\nSIM-RAG full Llama-3/BM25 70.7 75.6 32.7 43.3 34.1 40.2\nSIM-RAG full GPT-4/BM25 77.5 82.7 39.8 52.2 46.1 54.6\nTable 1: Comparison of RAG-based methods on three stan-\ndard RAG datasets.

Asterisk (*) indicates the results ob-\ntained from recent reproduction using newer models.\nLlama3 and GPT-4 version baselines for both methods as a reference\npoint for performance comparison. SEAKR [ 48], DRAGIN [ 35],\nSelf-RAG [ 1], Auto-RAG [ 49], FLARE [ 13], IR-COT [ 38] are more\nadvanced multi-round RAG methods. Some baselines are prompt-\nbased, and others are learned.\nThe baselines include two groups: (a) methods requiring access\nto an LLM\u2019s internal weights and open-source models, and (b)\nmethods that can use API-based closed-source models. In Group (a),\nSKEKR [ 48] and DRAGIN [ 35] do not involve fine-tuning; however,\nthey rely on model internals, such as hidden-layer Gram matrices\n(SKEKR) or token-level attention weights (DRAGIN), for retrieval.\nSelf-RAG [ 1] and Auto-RAG [ 49] fine-tune LLMs to support multi-\nround retrieval. While Self-RAG originally used Llama2, we report\nresults based on its recent replication [ 14] using Llama3 for a fair\ncomparison. Compared to SKEKR, DRAGIN, Self-RAG, and Auto-\nRAG methods, which require access to model weights, SIM-RAG\noffers greater flexibility without requiring open-source models.\nGroup (b) focuses on methods applicable to API-based closed-\nsource LLMs, primarily relying on prompting. FLARE [ 13] utilizes\nprobabilities or confidence scores of the next-generated-tokens to\nguide retrieval, while IR-CoT [ 38] interleaves retrieval with inter-\nmediate CoT reasoning steps, enabling effective multi-step question\nanswering. For better comparison, we include replication results\nfrom [ 14] using Llama3. Baselines with E5-base-v2 [ 40] as the Re-\ntriever potentially have an advantage due to higher-quality retrieval\nengines; however, they also require more GPU resources.\n3While Naive Generation and Standard RAG would technically fit in Group (b) (because\nthey can be used via API), we list their Llama-based variants in Group (a) for easier\ncomparison with other Llama-based methods.4.4 Results\nTable 1 summarizes the performance of various methods on three\nwidely used RAG datasets. SIM-RAG fullwith GPT-4 consistently\nperforms the best in all three datasets, outperforming all baseline\nmethods by a large margin, including Self-RAG and Auto-RAG,\nwhich require extensive full model fine-tuning for LLMs. A group-\nwise comparison further highlights the strengths of SIM-RAG.\nFor multi-hop QA datasets, when using closed-source GPT-4\nmodels, SIM-RAG fulldelivers the highest performance for both\nHotPotQA and 2Wiki. When using open-source Llama models,\nAuto-RAG performs the highest on 2Wiki, while SIM-RAG fullis the\nhighest on HotPotQA. Auto-RAG fine-tunes Llama3-8b for retrieval\ndecisions and uses a learned retrieval E5, whereas our approach\nonly fine-tunes a smaller Critic and uses a simpler BM25 retriever.\nIf reducing computational costs or using closed-source LLM models\nis a priority, SIM-RAG would be the optimal choice.\nIn contrast, for single-hop QA, a key observation is that all ad-\nvanced baselines tailored for multi-round RAG perform poorly on\nthe straightforward TriviaQA dataset. None of them match the per-\nformance of Standard RAG, and only Auto-RAG and FLARE outper-\nform Naive Generation. This exposes a critical limitation for these\napproaches: optimizing for complex multi-round retrieval tasks ap-\npears to undermine LLM\u2019s capability on simpler tasks. This may be\ndue to the inherent biases of LLMs, particularly their difficulty with\neffective self-critique, as discussed in Section 2.2. These challenges\nlead to Over-Confidence or Over-Retrieval, making LLMs less com-\npetitive on simpler tasks, where even a standard RAG approach with\na fixed number of retrieval steps performs better. In contrast, SIM-\nRAG uses an external model that specializes in \u201cwhen to stop the\niterative system.\u201d This distinction allows SIM-RAG fullwith Llama3\nto outperform Standard RAG with Llama3 by a significant margin\n(70.7% vs. 58.9%) in the EM metric. Similarly, SIM-RAG fullwith\nGPT-4 achieves a 16.0% absolute improvement over the Standard\nRAG baseline, representing a relative improvement of 26.1%.\nThe study on Critic size further reveals that SIM-RAG is an\neffective framework even with a lightweight Critic (783M). For\nexample, on HotPotQA, SIM-RAG litesignificantly outperforms Self-\nRAG (27.8% vs. 17.1%) while using only one-tenth of the training\nparameters (783M vs. 7B).\nThese findings indicate that even a lightweight Critic can im-\nprove system performance, though SIM-RAG may benefit from a\nlarger and more powerful Critic, particularly for complex multi-hop\nreasoning tasks.\n4.5 Analysis on Critic Predictions\nTo further evaluate the Critic\u2019s prediction accuracy, we report SIM-\nRAG with GPT-4\u2019s confusion matrices of its binary classification\nperformance on TriviaQA, HotPotQA, and 2Wiki datasets (Figure 3).\nThe clear diagonal lines (True Positive and True Negative) highlight\nthe Critic\u2019s ability to correctly predict whether to accept or reject\na Reasoner\u2019s output, based on the ground-truth answer. From the\nresults, the Critic demonstrates strong classification performance\nacross all datasets, with notably high accuracy in rejecting incorrect\nanswers, particularly for HotPotQA (63.9%) and 2Wiki (65.0%).\nHowever, the True Positive and True Negative rates differ signif-\nicantly between single-hop and multi-hop QA tasks. On TriviaQA,\n\nSIGIR \u201925, July 13\u201318, 2025, Padua, Italy.

These\ndiscrepancies are expected and reflect the differing characteristics\nof the datasets. SIM-RAG demonstrates an ability to adapt across\ndatasets, likely due to the distribution of the synthetically gener-\nated training data, which contains a higher proportion of positive\nexamples in TriviaQA compared to the multi-hop datasets.\n4.6 Ablation Study and Analysis\nImpact of Critic Model Choice. We conducted an ablation study\nto explore whether a more powerful, general-purpose model with\nstrong QA capabilities could serve as a better Critic. To this end, we\nreplaced Flan-T5-783M with GPT-4 as the Critic in our SIM-RAG lite\nsystem, while using GPT-4 as the Reasoner. In this configuration,\nGPT-4 functions as both the Reasoner and Critic using different\nprompt settings, an approach commonly referred to as self-critique\nin literature [ 6]. The comparison is visualized in Figure 4. Notably,\nunlike other baselines discussed in Table 1, GPT-4-as-the-Critic\nachieves strong results on TriviaQA. This suggests that for sim-\nple tasks, SIM-RAG may use a more general, powerful model like\nGPT-4 to achieve comparable outcomes. However, the gap becomes\nsignificant for more complex multi-hop tasks. As shown in the bar\nchart, GPT-4-as-the-Critic underperforms Flan-T5 across both EM\nand F1 metrics by a substantial margin. This finding aligns with ob-\nservations in the mathematical reasoning domain [ 10], where LLMs\noften struggle to provide reliable self-critiques on tasks involving\ncomplex reasoning. We suspect that a general-purpose LLM may be\nover-confident and generate too many false positives as the Critic.\nThis is a more serious problem for multi-round QA tasks, where\nthe percentage of actual \u201ccorrect\u201d predictions from the Reasoner is\nlow (as suggested by the confusion matrices in Figure 3).\nAnalysis of Inner Monologue Turns. As described in Section 3.1,\nthe SIM-RAG Self-Practicing Algorithm (Algorithm 1) defines an\narbitrary maximum number of retrieval turns \ud835\udc47during self-practice\nand inference. In practice, however, the number of turns is typically\nkept relatively low to strike a balance between the cost of inference\n(in terms of time and computational resources) and performance,\nwhile also taking into account the inherent limitations of LLM capa-\nbilities (more details in Section 5). To better understand the impact\nof the hyperparameter \ud835\udc47, we conducted an ablation study varying\n\ud835\udc47from 0 to 6. To save computational time, this experiment was\nperformed on a subset of the HotPotQA development set, compris-\ning 500 questions from the previously established RAG evaluation\nbenchmark [53].\n25456585\nTriviaQA (EM) HotPotQA (EM) 2Wiki (EM) TriviaQA (F1) HotPotQA (F1) 2Wiki (F1)Flan-T5-783M GPT-4SIM-RAG (GPT-4) with using different Critic modelsFigure 4: Ablation study on different Critic model choices.\nBoth follow the SIM-RAG setting with GPT-4 as the Reasoner,\nbut the blue bar uses learned Flan-T5-783M as a Critic, while\nthe red bar uses GPT-4 as the Critic (a.k.a., self-critique).\nTurns of Inner MonologueEM (%)\n01020304050\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6SIM-RAG (Oracle Critic) SIM-RAG (lite) Naive Gen\nFigure 5: Ablation study on different Inner Monologue turns\non HotPotQA.

The red line indicates the EM score using the\nground-truth label as an Oracle Critic.\nFigure 5 shows that larger \ud835\udc47leads to better performance, and\nthere is much room to improve the performance of SIM-RAG by\noptimizing this hyperparameter. The green line represents the Naive\nGeneration baseline, providing a reference point on LLM\u2019s zero-shot\nperformance. The blue line shows SIM-RAG lite\u2019s actual performance\nacross different turn settings, reflecting the system\u2019s ability to refine\nanswers iteratively. Finally, the red line indicates the performance\nceiling achievable using an Oracle Critic, which has access to the\nground-truth label to determine whether to accept the current\nanswer as the system\u2019s output.\nBy the final round, SIM-RAG achieves a 10.1% improvement over\nNaive Generation, corresponding to a 50.5% relative gain. Notably,\nusing the Oracle Critic achieves 47.2%, representing the theoretical\nupper limit of SIM-RAG without modifying the Reasoner. This\nhighlights the potential for further improvements in SIM-RAG\nthrough a better or larger Critic, as discussed in Section 4.4.\n\nKnowing You Don\u2019t Know: Learning When to Continue Search in Multi-round RAG through Self-Practicing SIGIR \u201925, July 13\u201318, 2025, Padua, Italy.\nWhen\ud835\udc47=0, SIM-RAG yields fewer exact-match answers than\nNaive Generation, primarily because the Critic occasionally rejects\ncorrect answers. This outcome is expected, as SIM-RAG is designed\nto abstain from providing answers when evidence is insufficient,\nthereby reducing hallucinations (i.e., false positives) at the expense\nof occasionally suppressing correct responses (i.e., true positives\nor exact-match answers). We limit \ud835\udc47to 6 in our experiments due\nto the context length constraint of the Critic. However, with ongo-\ning advances in extending language model context windows, this\nlimitation is expected to become less restrictive in the future.\nAnalysis on Self-Practicing Data. Figure 1 visualizes the inner\nmonologue traces generated during self-practicing. These traces\ncontribute to a rich and diverse training set, which naturally covers\nboth insufficient and excessive retrieval cases. In particular, the\nself-practicing data captures how retrieval decisions influence rea-\nsoning outcomes. As illustrated in the four examples, the 0-Round\nand 1-Round traces show incorrect predictions due to missing evi-\ndence, while the 2-Round trace demonstrates a correct prediction\nwhen sufficient information is retrieved. Moreover, the 3-Round\ntrace shows how over-retrieval introduces irrelevant information,\ndistracting the model from correct prediction. Unlike humans, who\ncan selectively attend to relevant information, LLMs are highly\nsensitive to noisy [ 30], misleading [ 51], or even long [ 22] inputs.\nConsequently, retrieving more information is not always beneficial\nfor LLMs. This characteristic highlights the importance of informa-\ntion sufficiency checking and explains why self-practicing data is\nvaluable in SIM-RAG.\n5 DISCUSSION\n5.1 Strengths and Weaknesses\nTask. As shown in Section 4.4, SIM-RAG excels in handling RAG\ntasks of varying complexity, from simple single-round retrieval\nto multi-round reasoning tasks. Its flexibility enables consistent\noutperformance of traditional baselines.\nDomain adaptation. Like most training-free domain adaptation\napproaches for LLMs, SIM-RAG performs well on tasks that align\nwith the Reasoner\u2019s pretraining corpus but may face challenges\nwith domain-specific jargon or highly specialized terminology. The\nCritic, on the other hand, is system-specific. The behavior-driven\ntraining (discussed in Section 5.2) ensures it is well aligned with the\nsystem used to generate the synthetic training data (in Algorithm\n1). However, if any major component of a RAG system, such as\nthe Reasoner or Retriever. is replaced or significantly updated, the\nCritic may require retraining to maintain optimal performance.\nComputational cost. The computational cost of SIM-RAG com-\nprises two main components: training and inference. For training,\nthe primary computational expense comes from data generation\nand Critic learning. The data generation phase requires (\ud835\udc47\u00d7\ud835\udc41)\nlarge model inferences, where \ud835\udc47represents the predefined maxi-\nmum number of retrieval rounds, and \ud835\udc41denotes the size of the\nsource dataset. The Critic training phase follows the standard re-\nsource demands of supervised learning. During inference, efficiency\ndepends on the Reasoner\u2019s capabilities. If the question aligns with\nthe LLM\u2019s pretrained knowledge, SIM-RAG is efficient. However, forunfamiliar domains, SIM-RAG may require more turns, highlight-\ning the importance of domain adaptation to optimize performance\nand reduce inference time.\nFailure Cases. Figure 1 provides an example of how our sys-\ntem can both benefit from and be hindered by the Critic rejecting\nresponses, as false rejections may lead to mistakes due to Over-\nRetrieval in the 3-Round example. Beyond the Critic\u2019s behavior,\nas shown in Figure 5, even an Oracle Critic yields low accuracy,\nhighlighting that failures also stem from broader limitations. These\ninclude the dataset\u2019s inherent difficulty, which challenges both the\nReasoner\u2019s knowledge and its ability to formulate effective search\nqueries, as well as the quality of the Retriever.\n5.2 Critic Learning\nFrom our empirical study, we found that introducing the Critic is a\nsimpler problem than solving the task. Prior studies show that Flan-\nT5-783M (the Critic in SIM-RAG lite) struggles to handle complex\ntasks through direct fine-tuning on training datasets [ 19]. Flan-\nT5-783M achieves only 14.7% EM score on the HotPotQA dataset\nvia fine-tuning, compared to 20.1% achieved by zero-shot Llama3.\nHowever, Flan-T5-783M can be trained in SIM-RAG to do a decent\njob of serving as a Critic for more powerful LLMs (Llama3 and\nGPT-4). One possible reason is that the Critic only needs to model\nthe relationships between the question, query, retrieved documents,\nthe LLM\u2019s predicted answer and rationale, and the correctness of\nthat prediction. That is, the Critic does not necessarily \u201cknow\u201d the\ncorrect answer or how to generate the correct answer; instead, it\nhas the easier task of learning to evaluate the coherence and validity\nof the LLM\u2019s output.\n6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this paper, we propose the SIM-RAG framework, a lightweight\nyet effective approach to optimizing multi-round RAG by adding a\ncritic module. This framework can work with both close-source and\nopen-source RAG systems, offering great flexibility in real-world\napplications. Since SIM-RAG does not modify the parameters of\nthe LLM, it functions as an inference-time enhancement to the\nRAG system, similar in goal to OpenAI-o1, but realized through a\nfundamentally different mechanism. In particular, this work intro-\nduces a novel Self-Practicing Algorithm to generate synthetic data\nto address the shortage of labeled, system-specific multi-round rea-\nsoning and retrieval training data. Experiments on three standard\nbenchmarks validate SIM-RAG\u2019s effectiveness.\nThis work opens up additional opportunities for future enhance-\nment of generative AI. Although SIM-RAG is a lightweight approach\nwithout requiring access to an LLM\u2019s weights, we recognize the po-\ntential for the trained Critic to be used as a reward model in future\nwork to optimize other components of RAG (Retriever, Reasoner,\netc.) through policy-based actor-critic reinforcement learning (e.g.,\nRLHF). Moreover, the capability of an AI system to recognize its\nlimitations\u2014 Knowing you don\u2019t know \u2014is crucial for reducing hal-\nlucination and enhancing trustworthiness and reliability. While\nthis paper focuses on multi-round RAG, we expect the novel Self-\nPracticing and Critic training techniques to be widely adopted to\nother AI problems.\n\nSIGIR \u201925, July 13\u201318, 2025, Padua, Italy.

Instead of generating a sin-\ngle scene geometry [ 14] or differentiable rendering prim-\nitives [ 49], interactive 3D scene synthesis focuses on arrang-\ning individual objects to construct a realistic layout while\npreserving natural interactions, function roles, and physi-\ncal principles. For example, chairs should face tables to\naccommodate seating, and small items are typically placed\ninside cabinets, drawers, and shelves without penetration.\nCapturing these spatial relationships is crucial for generat-\ning realistic scenes, allowing virtual environments to reflect\nreal-world structure and coherence.\nTraditional interactive scene generation methods, includ-\ning manual design [ 13,18,21], are often labor intensive\nand thus unscalable, while procedural approaches [ 6] pro-\nduce overly simplified scenes and fail to capture various\nreal-world spatial relations. In recent years, deep learning-\nbased scene generation methods, such as auto-regressive\nmodels [ 34] and diffusion approaches [ 41,47], have enabled\nend-to-end generation of 3D layouts. However, they rely\non object-annotated datasets like 3D-FRONT [ 12], which\nare small in scale, limited to indoor environments, and often\ncontain collisions [ 47]. These datasets primarily model large\nfurniture layouts while neglecting smaller objects and their\nfunctional interactions.\nThe emergence of large language models (LLMs) [ 10,20,\n48] expands scene diversity by leveraging common-sense\nknowledge from text, such as which objects should co-occur\nbased on human intent. However, their lack of visual percep-\ntion prevents them from accurately reproducing real-world\nspatial relations, leading to unrealistic object placements that\ndisregard functional roles, human intent, and physical con-\nstraints. As illustrated in Figure 2, LLM-generated scenes\noften misorient (e.g., chairs facing the cabinet) and misplace\n(e.g., cabinet placed against the window) objects; small ob-\njects are restricted to predefined locations (e.g., only on top\nof cabinets instead of inside). This lack of realism disrupts\nobject functionality, weakens spatial coherence, and hinders\nstructural consistency, ultimately making LLM-generated\nscenes impractical for real-world usability and interactions.\nBuilding on insights from vision foundation models that\nA relax bar lounge with chairs a wine cellar with red wall bricks\nFigure 2. Unrealistic 3D scenes generated by the LLM-based\nmethod (Holodeck [ 48]), exhibiting misplaced objects and oversim-\nplified spatial relations.\nencode compact spatial information and generate coherent\nscene distributions reflecting real-world layouts, we intro-\nduce Scenethesis \u2013 a training-free agentic framework that\nintegrates LLM-based scene planning with vision-guided\nspatial refinement. Building on top of LLMs, which lack\nreal-world perception, Scenethesis enforces vision-based\nspatial constraints to enhance realism and physical plausi-\nbility. Given a text prompt, Scenethesis employs an LLM\nfor reasoning of coarse layout, a vision module for layout\nrefinement, depth estimation, structural extraction, and a\nnovel optimization for iterative alignment of object place-\nment with visual prior through semantic correspondence\nmatching and signed distance field (SDF)-based physical\nconstraints, ensuring collision-free and stable integration\ninto digital environments. Finally, a judge module verifies\nthe spatial coherence. Quantitative and qualitative results\ndemonstrate that Scenethesis outperforms SOTA methods\nin scene diversity (generating indoor and outdoor scenes),\nlayout realism, and physical plausibility. The layouts gen-\nerated from Scenethesis can be used for downstream tasks\nsuch as virtual content creation, editing, and simulation. Our\ncontribution is summarized as follows.\n\u2022We introduce Scenethesis , a training-free agentic frame-\nwork, integrates LLMs, vision foundation models,\nphysical-aware optimization, and scene judgment to col-\nlaboratively generate realistic 3D interactive scenes.\n\u2022Scenethesis integrates LLM\u2019s common-sense reasoning\nfor coarse scene planning with vision-guided spatial refine-\nment, effectively capturing realistic inter-object relations.\n\u2022We propose a novel optimization process that iteratively\naligns objects using semantic correspondence matching\nand SDF-based physical constraints, enforcing collision-\nfree, stable, and semantically correct placements.\n\u2022We assess the diversity, layout realism, and object interac-\ntivity of scenes generated by Scenethesis , demonstrating\nsuperior spatial realism and physical plausibility compared\nto SOTA methods.\n2. Related Work\nIndoor Scene Synthesis. Realistic indoor scene synthe-\nsis is essential for simulating interactive environments\n2\n\nand training embodied agents for real-world tasks Early\nmethods framed this task as layout prediction, represent-\ning scenes as graphs with object relations [ 3,30,56] or\nhierarchical structures [ 23,42]. SceneFormer [ 43] and\nATISS [ 34] introduced autoregressive models to infer spatial\nrelations with 3D bounding box supervision. Recent ap-\nproaches learn layout distributions from 3D datasets like 3D-\nFRONT [ 12], while DiffuScene [ 41] and InstructScene [ 25]\nintegrate object semantics and geometry into diffusion pro-\ncesses. PhyScene [ 47] incorporates physical constraints.\nHowever, interactive scene generation methods remain\ndataset-constrained, limiting generalization and often pro-\nducing unrealistic compositions due to relaxed collision con-\nstraints [ 41,43]. Instead of learning layout distributions from\nlimited 3D datasets, Scenethesis derives spatial priors from\nimage generation models, enabling broader generalization\nacross diverse scenarios.\nLLM/VLM Guided 3D Scene Generation. Early ef-\nforts [ 6,7,37] relied on rule-based procedural mod-\neling to define spatial relations for interactive environ-\nments. With the rise of LLMs/VLMs, recent methods\nsuch as SceneTeller [ 33], Holodeck [ 48], SceneCraft [ 20],\nGALA3D [ 55], RobotGen [ 44], Open-Universe [ 1],\nGenUSD [ 26], LayoutVLM [ 40] and SceneX [ 54] leverage\nLLMs/VLMs for: (1) spatial relation planning via prede-\nfined implicit relations, (2) 3D asset retrieval from semantic\ndescriptions or vision-language embeddings, and (3) rule-\nbased rough collision detection, demonstrating large-scale\nscene generation potential. Although LLMs encode rich\ncommon sense knowledge, they struggle with fine-grained\nspatial reasoning. Predefined spatial relations in text descrip-\ntions are often simplistic, limiting their ability to capture\nthe complexity of the real-world scene [ 17,25]. In contrast,\nScenethesis leverages LLM priors to convert text prompts\ninto coarse layout instructions while using vision foundation\nmodel to persevere compact spatial information, effectively\ncapturing real-world spatial complexity.\nVisual Foundation Model-Guided Scene Generation. Vi-\nsual foundation models (VFMs), particularly image gen-\neration models, have advanced visual generation and are\nnow widely applied to 3D scene synthesis. Methods such\nas Text2Room [14], SceneScape [11], WonderJourney [50],\nWonderWorld [ 49], and Text2NeRF [ 52] integrate 2D diffu-\nsion with 3D priors (e.g., depth) to generate single-geometry\nscenes. However, this approach inherently faces challenges\nin handling occlusions and reconstructing hidden elements\ndue to the interconnected structure of real-world scenes,\nmaking them unsuitable for object interactions.\nArchitect [ 45] and Deep Prior Assembly (DPA) [ 53] in-\ntroduce 2D inpainting for interactive 3D scene generation\nand reconstruction. While this improves occlusion handling,\nthe lack of physical constraints and 3D reasoning leads to\nmisaligned, floating, or intersecting objects, making it diffi-cult to maintain functional object relationships for embodied\nAI tasks. In contrast, Scenethesis integrates physics-aware\noptimization, ensuring both spatial alignment with realistic\nvisual prior and physical plausibility.\nPhysics-Aware Scene Generation. Physical principles have\nbeen largely overlooked in 3D interactive scene genera-\ntion for both LLM-based and VFM-based methods. Recent\nworks, such as PhyScene [ 47] and Holodeck [ 48] enforce\nphysical constraints by detecting collisions using 3D bound-\ning boxes. While PhyScene reduces collision rates, it still\nexceeds 15% [ 47]. Holodeck focuses only on large-object\ncollision avoidance, neglecting small-object inter-collisions.\nDespite these advances, achieving full physical plausibility\nremains a challenge. To address this, Scenethesis incor-\nporates precise collision detection and stability constraints,\nsignificantly reducing collision and instability rates.\n3. Method\nScenethesis generates spatially realistic, physically plau-\nsible interactive 3D environments from user prompts. An\noverview of the pipeline is shown in Figure 3, consisting\nof four key stages: (1) an LLM module drafts a coarse\nscene plan, (2) a vision module refines the layout with vi-\nsual guidance and structural extraction, (3) a physical-aware\noptimization module distills priors and adjusts object place-\nment for spatial coherence and physical plausibility, and\n(4) a scene judge module verifies spatial consistency. The\nfollowing sections detail each module\u2019s role.\n3.1. Coarse Scene Planning\nScenethesis supports either a simple prompt (e.g., \u201ca peace-\nful beach during sunset\u201d) for flexible scene generation or a\ndetailed prompt for controllable scene generation (e.g., a\nscene plan describing the detailed spatial relations as shown\nin the appendix ). For a simple prompt, the LLM gener-\nates a coarse scene plan by reasoning over user input. It\nfirst interprets the prompt, reviews all object categories in\nthe available 3D database, selects commonly associated ob-\njects, and then generates an up-sampled prompt describing\ncoarse spatial relations, as illustrated in Figure 3. When\ngiven detailed prompts, the LLM checks for the presence of\nall specified objects in the database, infers relevant object\ncategories, and skips the prompt up-sampling process.\nAmong the selected objects, the LLM identifies an an-\nchor object, following prior work [ 48]. The anchor serves\nas the central reference point, occupying the highest spatial\nhierarchy apart from the ground . Then the LLM establishes\na coarse spatial hierarchy, positioning objects relative to the\nanchor and incorporating these relationships into the upsam-\npled prompt. For example, in a cozy living room, the sofa\nacts as the anchor at the center , while a bookshelf is placed\nin the background ,aligned against the wall. Other objects,\n3\n\nUser Prompt:\n\u201cA peaceful beach \nduring sunset\u201d\nVLM Grounded SAM Depth ProLLM\nInstruction :\nReasoning the prompt\u2026\nVerifying database objects\u2026\nSelecting common objects \u2026\nPlanning a coarse layout\u2026LLM Module: Coarse scene planningVision Module : Layout visual refinement Optimization Module : \nPhysics -aware optimization\nVLM\nJudge Module: Spatial coherence judgment\nGenerated scene\nPartial ViewCorrespondence\nSDF-based \nConstraint\nObject list\n\u2022Beach towel\n\u2022Beach chair \n\u2022Umbrella\n\u2022V olleyball \n\u2022Seashell \n\u2022\u2026Upsampled  prompt\nThis is a \u2026 beach. \nThe seashell is \nplaced on the beach \ntowel\u2026 The beach \nchair is placed  in \nfront of \u2026 Image guidance2D\nGeneration  Objaverse  \ndatabase\n\u2026\nRetrieved  assets & environment map\nchair2\nball1\nbucket3\nground\nsunglass2sunglass1\nseashell\nScene graphumbrella1\nchair1\nbucket1bucket2\nFigure 3.

Finally, a judge module verifies the scene spatial coherence.\nsuch as a coffee table or chairs, are positioned in front of or\nbeside the sofa.\n3.2. Layout Visual Refinement\nA key insight of Scenethesis is that image generation mod-\nels inherently encode object functionality and spatial rela-\ntionships by learning common co-occurrences and spatial\narrangements from large-scale image datasets. The vision\nmodule refines the coarse layout through three steps: (1)\nImage Guidance \u2013 Generates images to refine spatial rela-\ntions, ensuring realism and object functionality. (2) Scene\nGraph Generation \u2013 Segments objects, estimates depth and\n3D bounding boxes, and constructs a graph encoding inter-\nobject relationships to establish the initial layout. (3) Asset\nRetrieval \u2013 Selects 3D assets and environment maps for final\nscene composition.\nImage Generation. Thevision module refines the upsam-\npled prompt into a visually structured scene representation.\nThis generated image serves as the basis for segmentation,\ndepth estimation, and asset retrieval.\nScene Graph Generation. Leveraging vision foundation\nmodels such as GPT-4o [ 16], Grounded-SAM [ 39], and\nDepthPro [ 2], the vision module constructs a scene graph\nthat localizes objects using 3D bounding boxes (3DBB) and\nidentifies structural components, including the anchor object ,\nparent objects , and child objects (see Figure 3).\nTo initialize asset 5DoF poses, vision module segments\nobjects using semantic cues, estimates depth maps, and\nprojects them into a 3D point cloud. However, due to occlu-\nsion, limited perspectives, and segmentation errors, cropped\nimage guidance may miss full object visibility, leading to\nbiases in 3DBB estimation \u2013 necessitating pose adjustments\nlater (Sec. 3.3.1).\nThe scene graph forms the basis for iterative 5DoF poseadjustments during optimization in the next stage. Since\nScenethesis focuses on ground-level object layout, back-\nground elements, e.g. wall decorations, are visually defined\nby the retrieved environment map. Detailed scene graph\nformatting instructions are provided in the appendix .\nAsset Retrieval. Unlike existing 3D object generation and\nreconstruction techniques [ 24,46], such as 3D Gaussian\nsplatting, which can produce photorealistic visuals but suffer\nfrom artifacts and geometric inconsistencies. These methods\nlack editable meshes, UV mappings, and decomposable PBR\nmaterials, making them incompatible with standard produc-\ntion workflows. To address these limitations, Scenethesis\nadopts a retrieval-based approach for asset selection, ensur-\ning both geometric fidelity and editability for downstream\napplications. We construct a high-quality asset subset from\nObjaverse [ 8] similar to Holodeck [ 48], and supplemented\nwith a custom environment map dataset. In the final step, the\n3D assets and an environment map are retrieved to assemble\na visually coherent scene. Retrieval details can be found in\nappendix .\n3.3. Physics-aware Optimization\nDirectly placing 3D assets based on estimated point clouds\nfrom image guidance poses significant challenges: (1) Occlu-\nsions in real-world scenarios result in incomplete 3D point\nclouds, leading to errors in object orientation, scale, and po-\nsition. (2) Discrepancies between retrieved assets and image\nguidance in texture and shape make precise pose estimation\ndifficult. To overcome these issues, Scenethesis employs a\nphysics-aware optimization powered by robust semantic\nfeature matching [ 4,9,51] and signed-distance fields (SDFs).\nThis optimization process iteratively refines object poses to\nensure pose alignment and physical plausibility.\n4\n\nParentChild\n\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc58)\n|\ud835\udc51|\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc7b,\ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc96)\n\ud835\udc96\ud835\udc7b\n|\ud835\udc51|\ud835\udc96\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc51,\ud835\udc96)\ud835\udc60\n\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4f\n\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52Optimized objectCollided object Parent object\n\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4eFigure 4. Collision avoidance andstability maintenance .\n3.3.1. Pose Alignment\nTo address pose estimation errors from occlusions, segmen-\ntation, or asset mismatches, we adopt dense correspondence\nmatching from RoMa [ 9], leveraging semantic spatial fea-\ntures for robustness to occlusions and partial views. Un-\navoidable discrepancies in texture and shape between image\nguidance and retrieved assets are mitigated by focusing on\nhigh-level semantics over low-level details.\nFor each object, we match Ncorrespondences between\nthe rendered object and partially visible regions in the image\nguidance in 2D space. It then minimizes MSE loss on both\n2D and 3D spatial locations of these Ncorrespondences,\nbackpropagating gradients to refine scale, translation, and\nupright rotation, as shown in Figure 3. Further details on\npose estimation are provided in the Appendix .\n3.3.2. Physical Plausibility\nReal-world 3D scenes obey physical constraints, ensuring\nobjects remain stable on contact surfaces and collision-free.\nHowever, pose alignment with image guidance alone does\nnot guarantee physical plausibility\u2014objects may intersect,\nfloat, or sink due to shape discrepancies and errors in scene\nunderstanding. See Figure 9 (b) as an example.\nExisting methods approximate object geometry using\n3D bounding boxes (3DBB) [ 47,48], which oversimplifies\nshapes and leads to simplified inter-object relationships. For\nexample, objects cannot be put within the shelf due to 3D\nbounding box collision. This results in simplified scene\ndiversity, especially in tight spaces with complex inter-object\nrelationships (see Figure 8 for an example). To address\nthese challenges, we replace 3DBB-based approximations\nwith Signed Distance Fields (SDFs), enabling precise object\ngeometry representation for accurate collision detection and\nstability constraints.\nThe physical-aware optimization process iteratively\nconstructs a SDF-based physical structure, following the\nscene graph hierarchy: processing the anchor object first to\nestablish a stable foundation, followed by parent and child\nobjects. The physics-aware optimization incorporates col-\nlision andstability constraints . Since retrieved 3D assets\nare upright, their rotation is constrained to azimuthal adjust-\nments.\nFormally, given a scene graph with Nobjects, each object\nhas a 5-DoF configuration defined by scale s, upright rota-\ntionR, and translation T= (tx, ty, tz). For computationalefficiency, we uniformly sample npoints from its triangle\nsurface mesh as its geometric representation and compute its\ncentroid for collision avoidance.\nCollision Constraints. We query the scene SDFs using\nobject surface points to detect collision states and define po-\nsition collision loss Ltranslation and scale collision loss Lscale.\nAs shown in Figure 4, the deviation caused by collisions\nimpacts translation Tas:\nLtranslation =X\nvi\u2208V\u2212||f(T,|di|,ui)\u2212T||2\n2, (1)\nwhere f(T,|di|,ui) =T+ui\u00b7|di|computes a collision-free\nposition by adjusting the translation along direction uiwith\nstep size |di|. Here, diis the negative SDF value at a collided\npointvi, which belong to the points set with negative SDF\nV\u2212sampled uniformly from the surface. The direction uis\ndefined from the collision point toward the model\u2019s centroid,\nguiding objects away from collisions.\nCollisions also affect object scale sdue to opposing\nforces:\nLscale=\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f3P\nvi\u2208V\u2212\u0012\ng(|di|,ui)\u2212s\u00132\nifNcluster>1\n0 otherwise,\n(2)\nwhere g(|di|,ui) =||ui||\u2212|di|\n||ui||defines the target scale to re-\nduce collision regions. Ncluster denotes the number of distinct\nclusters formed without SDF sign flipping. As shown in Fig-\nure 4, two surface points iandjwithdi\u22640anddj\u22640\nbelong to different clusters, and thus push the object to be\nsmaller.\nStability Constraints. Objects are dragged by gravity and\nrest on their bottom contacting surface. We ensure stability\nby enforcing contact between an object\u2019s bottom points and\nits parent surface, where their SDF values should be zero, as\nshown in Figure 4. The stability loss is defined as:\nLstability =X\nvi\u2208VB\u0012\n1\u2212exp(\u2212d2\ni)\u0013\n, (3)\nwhere VBare the sampled points on the bottom surface of\nbounding box, and diare their corresponding SDF values.\nFurther details on collision loss optimization are provided in\ntheAppendix .\n3.4. Spatial Coherence Judgment\nAfter iteratively optimizing object placement, a scene judge\npowered by GPT-4o evaluates the spatial alignment between\nthe generated 3D scene and the image guidance produced\nduring the layout refinement stage, ensuring consistency in\ninter-object relationships.\nTo assess this alignment, we design three metrics: (1)\nobject category accuracy, comparing the generated scene\n5\n\nShopping Centers Tourist Attractions Sports and Fitness Medical Facilities Residential Area Education Institute020406080Human Preference (Percentage)Holodeck\nScenethesisFigure 5. Human preference on diverse indoor scenes.\nwith the image guidance; (2) object orientation alignment,\nmeasuring how well object orientations match the reference\nlayout; (3) overall spatial coherence, capturing the holistic\nconsistency of the scene layout.\nEach metric is normalized between 0 (lowest) and 1 (high-\nest). If any metric falls below a predefined threshold, the\nscene judge triggers a re-planning step. Further details are\nprovided in the Appendix .\n4. Experiment\nImplementation. We use GPT-4o [ 16] as the LLM and im-\nage generation in vision module. Following Holodeck [ 48],\nwe retrieve 3D models from a high-quality Objaverse [ 8]\nsubset. Other module details are discussed in the above\nsection. The physics-aware optimization is implemented by\nPyTorch [ 35] and PyTorch3D [ 38]. Experiments are run on\nan A100 GPU.\nBaselines. Since we focus on interactive scene genera-\ntion, methods producing only single-geometry representa-\ntions are not relevant. We compare our approach against\nopen-sourced state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative methods\n(DiffuScene [ 41], PhyScene [ 47]) and LLM-based methods\n(SceneTeller [ 33], Holodeck [ 48]). For fairness, all LLM-\nbased methods use the same ChatGPT version.\nSetup. Scenethesis generates both indoor and outdoor scenes\n(Figure 1, Figure 6), but for fair comparison, we evaluate\nonly indoor scenes. To assess diversity and realism, we gen-\nerate 22 indoor scenes covering 6 primary and 12 secondary\ncategories from DL3DV-10K [ 29]:Residential (living room,\nplayroom, garage, warehouse ),Shopping (bookstore, store ),\nTourism (museum, piano showroom ),Sports (gym, billiard\nclub),Medical (ward ),Education (laboratory ). Since Dif-\nfuScene, PhyScene, and SceneTeller were trained on indoor\ndatasets [ 12] (mainly residential areas), we compare them\nwithin this domain. Holodeck, which also retrieves models\nfrom Objaverse, supports indoor scene generation, enabling\ncomparisons across all indoor categories. To mitigate view-\ndependent bias, we render each scene from two perspectives,\nyielding 44 image pairs. For baselines lacking background\ngeneration (e.g. SceneTeller), we render Scenethesis outputs\nwithout an environment map for a fair comparison.4.1. Metrics\nWe evaluate controllability in text-based scene generation\nmethods and three key properties essential for virtual con-\ntent generation: layout realism ,physical plausibility , and\ninteractivity .\nControllability. Ensuring 3D scene generation aligns with\ninput prompts is crucial. We assess this using: (1) CLIP\nScore [36] \u2013 cosine similarity between image and text fea-\ntures from CLIP. (2) BLIP Score [22] \u2013 image-text alignment\nusing the ITM head of BLIPv2. (3) VQA Score [27] \u2013 image-\ncaption alignment based on VQA models.\nLayout Realism. Visual quality and spatial realism are im-\nportant to reflect real-world scene layouts. We evaluate it\nusing following metrics: (1) Object Diversity \u2013 number of\nobjects and categories in the scene. (2) Layout Coherence \u2013\nadherence of object positions and orientations to common\nsense. (3) Spatial Realism \u2013 presence of diverse spatial rela-\ntions (e.g., on top of, inside, under). (4) Overall Performance\n\u2013 alignment of object categories and styles with the scene\ntype. Evaluation details and examples are in the appendix .\nPhysical Plausibility. Ensuring object collision-free and\nstable placement is fundamental for physical simulation en-\nvironments. We construct the following metrics: (1) Col-O\n\u2013 average object collision rate, (2) Col-S \u2013 average scene\ncollision rate, (3) Inst-O \u2013 average object instability rate, and\n(4)Inst-S \u2013 average scene instability rate.\nCollision is tested via mesh-mesh intersections, while in-\nstability follows Atlas3D [ 5], measured by tracking transfor-\nmations after physics-based simulation [ 31]. These metrics\nassess scene viability for virtual content creation.\nInteractivity. To ensure objects are accessible and manipu-\nlable in the scene based on their functional roles, we follow\nevaluation metrics from PhyScene [ 47]: (1) Reach \u2013 average\nobject reachability rate, and (2) Walk \u2013 ratio of the largest\nconnected walkable area over all walkable regions.\n4.2. Quantitative Evaluation\nControllability. Table 1 presents a comprehensive evalua-\ntion of text-image alignment. Among all baselines, Scenethe-\nsisachieves the highest CLIP, BLIP, and VQA scores, con-\nfirming its effectiveness in adhering to text description and\nthe reliability of our agentic pipeline.\nLayout Realism.

Despite DiffuScene\nand PhyScene being trained on dedicated indoor residential\ndatasets [ 12], the training-free Scenethesis achieves compara-\nble or superior layout realism in residential areas.

Table 2 presents\nobject-level and scene-level physical plausibility metrics,\ndemonstrating that Scenethesis significantly reduces colli-\nsions and enhances stability.\nDiffuScene [ 41] and SceneTeller [ 33], trained on high-\ncollision datasets [ 12,47], lack collision detection andstability constraints, leading to frequent object intersec-\ntions. PhyScene [ 47] applies physical constraints but inherits\ndataset-induced collisions. Holodeck [ 48] prevents large-\nobject collisions via Depth-First-Search solver but places\nsmall objects on predefined surfaces without collision checks,\noften causing inter-object penetrations (see appendix ). More-\nover, none of these baselines address stability, resulting in\nfrequent failures in physics-based simulations.\nIn contrast, Scenethesis integrates physics-aware layout\nadjustment, ensuring low-collision, stable environments. Be-\nyond physical plausibility, Scenethesis excels in interactivity,\nachieving superior reachability and walkability scores. These\nresults highlight Scenethesis \u2019s ability to generate accessi-\nble, navigable environments where objects align with their\nfunctional roles and afford interactions.\n7\n\nA modern car in the garage A home gym room A children playroomFigure 7.

Spatial realism comparison\nbetween Scenethesis and Holodeck. Scenethesis generates spatially\nplausible 3D scenes, precisely placing small objects (e.g., bag,\nwine bottle, shoes, vase) within shelf compartments rather than just\non top. This precision, challenging for LLM-based methods, is\nessential for embodied agent manipulation tasks [32, 47].\n4.3. Qualitative Evaluation\nFigure 6 showcases diverse scenes generated by Scenethesis ,\ndemonstrating high fidelity and versatility in both indoor and\noutdoor environments. Compared to LLM-based approaches,\nScenethesis excels in realism and physical plausibility by\nleveraging image guidance and physics-aware optimization,\neffectively capturing real-world spatial complexity and di-\nversity. Figure 7 presents various 3D layouts generated from\nthe same text prompt, highlighting diverse asset selection\nand spatial arrangements. Scenethesis supports both sim-\nple and detailed prompts\u2014simple prompts enable flexible,\nuser-friendly generation, while detailed prompts allow con-\ntrollable 3D scene generation (see appendix ).\nHolodeck restricts small object placement to predefined\nareas on the top of larger objects. In contrast, Scenethesis\nenables fine-grained positioning, placing small object at dif-\nferent levels of the support structure (e.g., shelves, carts), asTable 3.

Ablation Study\nThe physics-aware optimization has three components: pose\nalignment ,collision constraint , and stability constraint . We\nperform ablation studies to assess their effectiveness.\nMetric. For each generated scene, we render the same view\nas the image guidance and use GPT-4o to assess pose align-\nment based on: (1) object orientation, size, and position\nsimilarity, and (2) spatial coherence of the overall layout.\nThe similarity score ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating\nthe highest alignment. Wall decorations are ignored in the\ncomparison. Additionally, we evaluate object collisions and\ninstability using the method in Section 4.2.\nBaselines. Raw Layout : Objects are placed based on 3DBB\nestimated by segmentation and depth prediction methods.\nPose Alignment : Aligns object placement with image guid-\nance via correspondence matching. Collision Constraint :\nOptimizes placement to avoid collisions. Stability Con-\nstraint : Ensures objects remain stable.\nResults. As shown in Table 3, pose alignment significantly\nimproves spatial consistency, while collision and stability\nconstraints enhance physical plausibility, making scenes\nsimulation-ready. Figure 9 shows qualitative visualization.\n5. Conclusion and Limitation\nWe introduce Scenethesis , a training-free agentic framework\nfor generating high-fidelity interactive 3D scenes by leverag-\ning LLM-based coarse scene planning, vision-guided layout\nrefinement, and physics-aware optimization for object po-\nsition adjustment. A scene judge module ensures spatial\ncoherence. Experimental results demonstrate that it signif-\nicantly outperforms SOTA baselines in layout coherence,\nspatial realism, and plausibility. Our approach is limited\nby retrieval databases since generative 3D methods cannot\nyet handle articulation. Future advances in generative 3D\ncould overcome this constraint by enabling articulated object\nsynthesis, enhancing scene diversity.\n9\n\nScenethesis : A Language and Vision Agentic Framework for 3D Scene Generation\nSupplementary Material\n6. Implementation Details of Scenethesis\n6.1. Algorithm Overview\nIn this section, we provide a high-level algorithmic overview\nofScenethesis , with detailed steps outlined in Algorithm 1.\n6.2. Method Details\n6.2.1. Coarse Scene Planning\nUsing the user\u2019s scene prompt as input, the LLM (powered\nby GPT-4o [16]) follows a six-step process:\n1. Interpreting the user\u2019s scene prompt.\n2.Reviewing the object categories available in the provided\nasset database.\n3. Selecting relevant objects from the asset list.\n4. Cross-checking the availability of the selected objects.\n5. Planning the scene using the selected objects.\n6.Generating output files according to the specified stan-\ndards.\nThe final coarse scene planning output consists of two\ncomponents: a list of selected object categories commonly\nfound in the scene (defining anchor object and other com-\nmon objects) and an upsampled prompt that outlines the\nscene\u2019s spatial hierarchy. The designed prompt presents\ninCoarse Scene Planning Instruction Prompts Section 7.1\nand the output example is in Coarse Scene Planning Output\nExample Section 7.2.\n6.2.2. Layout Visual Refinement\nBased on the upsampled prompt, GPT-4o generates an im-\nage to serve as fine-grained layout guidance. Several post-\nprocessing steps are applied to the generated image:\n\u2022Scene Graph Construction: GPT-4o [ 16] is used to gener-\nate a scene graph, defining the ground as the root object ,\nalong with parent objects and their corresponding child\nobjects . Additionally, Grounded-SAM [ 39] segments each\nobject in the image to obtain masks and cropped images.\nThese are then projected into 3D space using Depth Pro [ 2],\nallowing for the initial positioning of objects within a spa-\ntial relationship graph.\n\u2022Asset Retrieval. CLIP (ViT-L/14 trianed on LAION-2B)\nimage and semantic features are employed to retrieve 3D\nassets that align with the image guidance. GPT-4o [ 16]\nis further utilized to select the most relevant environment\nmap based on the upsampled prompt. It is important to\nnote that Scenethesis focuses on layout planning for ob-\njects on the ground, while background elements, such as\nwall decorations, lighting, or outdoor settings (e.g., sun-\nshine or the sea), are visually determined by the environ-\nment map.The output of the fine-grained layout planning includes the\ngenerated image as guidance, a scene graph with the initial\nposes of the objects, the retrieved assets, and the retrieved\nenvironment map. The visual details are presented in the\nvideo .\n6.2.3. Physics-aware optimization Details\nThe physics-aware optimization is an iterative optimization\nprocess that consists of two key components: pose align-\nment optimization and physical plausibility optimization.\npose alignment optimization focuses on aligning the position,\ndimension, and orientation of 3D models with their coun-\nterparts in the image guidance to ensure visual coherence\nfor spatial relationships. Physical plausibility optimization\nensures that the 3D models in the scene are free from colli-\nsions and maintain stability, contributing to a realistic and\nphysically consistent layout.\nPose Alignment. To align the position, dimension, and ori-\nentation for objects in rendered image and their counterpart\nin image guidance, Scenethesis applies the dense semantic\ncorrespondence matching from RoMa [ 9]. That is, mini-\nmizing the distance between correspondence points in the\nrendered image Iand the guided image \u02dcI. Suppose there\nareNobjects in the rendered image I, each represented\nbyoand defined by a 5-DoF configuration, which includes\nscale s, upright rotation R, and translation T= (tx, ty, tz).\nThe counterpart of each object in the generated image \u02dcIis\ndenoted as \u02dc o. The objective of ensuring visual coherence\nis to minimize the distance between corresponding points\nby optimizing the 5-DoF parameters. This ensures that the\nspatial positions, dimension, and orientations of the 3D mod-\nels are closely aligned with their counterparts in the guided\nimage. The matching process is formalized as:\n{p(x, y),\u02dcp(x, y)}m\ni=RoMa (o,\u02dco), (4)\nwhere p(x, y),\u02dcp(x, y)are correspondent pair in object oand\n\u02dco. We select mpair points in each optimization iteration with\nconfident score higher than \u03c4. The higher confidence score\nindicates a higher probability of matching. We minimize the\n2D pixel distance and 3D projected point clouds distance\nbetween the matched pair denoted as follows:\nLpose=\u03bb2dL2d+\u03bb3dL3d, (5)\nwhere \u03bb2dand\u03bb3dare coefficients of the 2D pixel loss and\n3D point cloud loss denoted as L2dandL3d.\n1\n\nAlgorithm 1 Text to 3D Interactive Scene Generation\n1:Input: User text\n2:Output: 3D interactive scene layout\n3:\nStage Stage 1: Coarse Scene Planning :\n4: object list, upsampled prompt \u2190LLM(user text) \u25b7obtain the object list and an upsampled prompt\n5:\n6:\nStage Stage 2: Layout Visual Refinement :\n7: img guidance \u21902DDiffusion (upsampled prompt) \u25b7generate the guidance image as the reference\n8: cropped images \u2190Grounded SAM (img guidance, object list) \u25b7identify each object and crop the images\n9: depth map\u2190Depth Pro (img guidance) \u25b7generate depth map\n10: 5DoF poses\u2190Extract Poses (cropped images, depth map) \u25b7generate initial 5DoF poses\n11: scene graph\u2190VLM (img guidance, object list, 5DoF poses) \u25b7generate scene graph\n12: 3Dassets\u2190CLIP (cropped images, object list) \u25b7retrieve 3D assets\n13: environment map\u2190VLM (upsampled prompt) \u25b7retrieve environment maps\n14:\n15:\nStage Stage 3: Physics-aware Optimization:\n16: scene SDF\u2190Init Scene SDF(anchor object) \u25b7compute SDF for each object\n17: fornode in scene graph.bfs traverse() do \u25b7iterate over all objects\n18: s,R,T\u2190node.pose \u25b7variables to be optimized\n19: parent SDF\u2190node.parent.SDF \u25b7obtain parent object\u2019s SDF\n20: foriteration = 1 to max iterations do\n21: mesh\u2190GetObject Mesh (node)\n22: mesh\u2217\u2190Apply Transform (mesh, s,R,T) \u25b7coordinate alignment\n23: img rendered, depth rendered \u2190Render (mesh\u2217, camera) \u25b7render RGB and depth images\n24: correspondence \u2190RoMa (img guidance, img rendered) \u25b7correspondence matching\n25: mesh points \u2190GetPoint Clouds (depth rendered, correspondence, camera)\n26: guided points \u2190GetPoint Clouds (depth map, correspondence, camera)\n27: Lpose 2D\u2190Dist 2D(correspondence) \u25b7loss computation\n28: Lpose 3D\u2190Dist 3D(mesh points, guided points)\n29: Lcollision \u2190Collision (mesh\u2217, scene SDF)\n30: Lstability \u2190Stability (bottom points(mesh), parent SDF)\n31: loss\u2190\u03bbLpose+\u03bbcollision Lcollision +\u03bbstability Lstability\n32: loss.Backward()\n33: optimizer.

The black dot represents the centroid of the target object, the purple dots indicate\nsurface nodes with negative SDF values, and the red point vkis the bottom node of the object. (a). The collision pushes the circle object out\nof the rectangle along the direction from the sampled point to the circle\u2019s center by step |d|. (b). The collision indicates the object is too\nlarge and negative signed distance fields (SDF) points ( i.e. point vaand point vb) are detected from distinct classes of the object during\noptimization. The collision loss shrinks the object size such that there are no different clusters of negative SDF points on the object surface\ncan be detected. (c). The stability maintenance keeps the the child and the parent to be as close as possible.\nPhysical Plausibility. Physical plausibility ensure gener-\nated 3D scenes adhering to fundamental physical principles.\nInstead of using 3D bounding box (3DBB) as object approx-\nimation, Scenethesis accurately detects collision state from\nthe surface points of the 3D models using signed distance\nfield (SDF). The collision avoidance andstability mainte-\nnance as illustrated in Figure 10.\nThecollision avoidance affects the translation Tby:\nLtranslation =||f(T,|d|,u)\u2212T||2\n2, (6)\nwhere f(T, d,u) =T+u\u00b7 |d|computes a collision-free\nposition \u02c6Tby adjusting Talong direction uwith step size d.\nHere, dis the negative SDF value at a collided point visuch\nthatd(vi)\u22640and|d|= max(0 ,\u2212d(vi))is the negative\nSDF value dafter being processed through a ReLU function,\nmeaning only collided points contribute to this collision term.\nThe direction uis defined from the collision point toward the\nmodel\u2019s centroid C, guiding objects away from collisions.\nThecollision avoidance affects the scaling sby detecting\nthat object collides from at least two different directions:\nLscale=\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f3P\nvi\u2208V\u2212\u0012\ng(|di|,ui)\u2212s\u00132\nifNcluster>1\n0 otherwise,\n(7)\nwhere g(|di|,ui) =||ui||\u2212|di|\n||ui||defines the target scale to re-\nduce collision regions. Ncluster denotes the number of distinct\nclusters formed without SDF sign flipping. As shown in Fig-\nure 4, two surface points iandjwithdi\u22640anddj\u22640\nbelong to different clusters, and thus push the object to be\nsmaller.Thestability maintenance affects the translation Tby:\nLstability =X\nvi\u2208VB\u0012\n1\u2212exp(\u2212d2\ni)\u0013\n, (8)\nwhere VBare the sampled points on the bottom surface of\nbounding box, and diare their corresponding SDF values.\nMethod Overview Building on the physics-aware opti-\nmization described above, we now integrate pose spatial\nconstraints and physical constraints into the text-to-3D opti-\nmization framework. Since physical loss depends on object\ngeometry and can alter its spatial position, it may affect the\nrendered visible regions due to occlusions or shifts in the\nscene, introducing biases in pose alignment when using im-\nage guidance for semantic correspondence matching. To\nmitigate this, we adopt a two-stage optimization strategy:\nfirst, we optimize pose alignment based on correspondence\nmatching; then, we refine object placement with physical\nconstraints to ensure a visually coherent and physically plau-\nsible 3D scene. The following function defines the joint\noptimization of object position, orientation, and scale:\nL=\u03bbpLpose+\u03bbcTLtranslation +\u03bbcSLscale+\u03bbsLstability (9)\n6.3. Experiment Details\nParameters. For pose alignment, we select the m= 100\ncorrespondence points with matching conference \u03c4\u22650.6\nin each optimization iteration. Additionally, we uniformly\nselect n= 400 samples from the surface of 3D model to\n3\n\nUser specified long prompt case User specified short  prompt caseFigure 11. Short prompt : a living room with reading materials;\ndetailed long prompt : A living room that provide a neutral and\ncozy space with a minimalist design. At the center of the scene,\na light beige sofa is positioned against a textured stone wall in\nthe background. In front of the sofa, a round wooden coffee table\nsits on the floor, with a white coffee cup placed on top. Two blue\narmchairs are symmetrically arranged on either side of the coffee\ntable, facing inward toward the sofa. Behind each armchair, a tall\nwhite floor lamp stands, providing ambient lighting. Next to the\nlamps, green potted plants are placed near the wall, adding a natural\ndecorative touch.\naccurately detect the collision and stability states in each\noptimization iteration.\nWe explored Adam andSGD as the optimizer during the\noptimization process. Though Adam has been widely applied\nfor training deep neural networks, the adaptive momentum\nmakes the optimization unstable, leading to sub-optimal\noptimized pose. So we use SGD in our implementation. The\noptimization implementation is based on pytorch3D [ 38] and\nthe visualization is rendered using Blender.\nPrompts. Scenethesis supports both short and detailed\nuser-specified prompts. A short prompt provides a user-\nfriendly and flexible approach to 3D scene generation, where\nthe LLM interprets the input, revisits the available 3D models\nin database, selects the common objects and anchor objects,\nand generates an upsampled text prompt for coarse layout\nplanning. In contrast, a long prompt, which includes user-\ndefined objects and inter-object relationships, enables greater\nuser control over 3D scene generation. In this case, the LLM\ndirectly reasons over the detailed prompt, revisits available\n3D models in the database, and defines the anchor object,\nskipping the upsampling stage. We illustrate examples of\nshort and long prompts defining a living room in Figure 11.\nWe compared four baselines\u2014Physcene [ 47],\nDiffuscene [ 41], SceneTeller [ 33], and\nHolodeck [ 48]\u2014evaluating visual quality, physical\nplausibility, and interactivity metrics. Among them,\nDiffuscene, SceneTeller, and Holodeck perform text-to-3D\nscene generation. For visual quality assessment, we use\nboth a user study and GPT-4o as evaluation tools. Unlike\nother baselines, which generate only living room, bedroom,\nFigure 12. User study example.\nand dining room scenes from 3D-FRONT [ 12], Holodeck\nandScenethesis utilize Objaverse [ 8] as a retrieval database,\nenabling more diverse indoor scene generation.\nWe outline the GPT-4o prompt assessment for both base-\nline evaluation and ablation evaluation as follows:\n\u2022Comparison with baselines by GPT-4o: GPT-4o is em-\nployed to evaluate the generated scenes for four metrics:\nobject diversity ,layout coherence ,spatial realism and\ncomplexity , and overall performance . The evaluation\nprompts are detailed in the Instruction Prompts for Evalu-\nating Generated Scene Section 7.3. Additionally, a com-\nparison example of the generated scenes is provided in\nFigure 13 with their evaluation results generated by GPT-\n4o detailed in Evaluation Example of Generated Scenes\nSection 7.4.\n\u2022Comparison with baselines by human preference : We\napplied a user study to study human preference of baseline\nmethod with our method. See Figure 12 as an example.\nThere are 69 users took our survey.\n\u2022Evaluation in Ablation Studies: GPT-4o is also utilized\nto assess the pose alignment metric during the ablation\nstudies of Scenethesis \u2019s physics-aware optimization. This\nevaluation measures the similarity of object position, size,\nand orientation with their counterparts in the image guid-\nance, as well as the overall visual coherence of the layout.\nThe instructions for assessing pose alignment are provided\nin the Instruction Prompts for Ablation Study Section 7.5.\n4\n\nScenethesis Holodeck\nFigure 13.

We present additional qualitative results for\nScenethesis \u2019s scenes.\n\u2022Qualitative Results of Scenethesis \u2019s Scene: We present\ndifferent camera views to showcase the qualitative results\nofScenethesis \u2019s scenes, as shown in Figure 15. Figure 17\npresents the generated scenes by Scenethesis with their\nimage guidance. Note that Scenethesis focuses on layout\nplanning for ground objects. The absence of certain unique\nassets in Objaverse [ 8] may cause discrepancies between\nthe generated scene and the image guidance. Future work\ncould address this by incorporating more diverse assets.\n\u2022Quantitative Results of Physical plausibility Compar-\nison: The physical Plausibility quantitative comparison\npresented in Table 1 of the Experiment section. While\nHolodeck applies both soft and hard constrains based on\nthe Depth-First-Search Solver and small objects are placed\non predefined locations. These small objects may collide\nwith each other due to the shape and size variations as\nshown in Figure 14.\n\u2022Visual Comparison with Holodeck: In addition to the\nquantitative comparison presented in Table 1 of the Exper-\niment section, we provide a visual comparison between\nScenethesis and Holodeck, a state-of-the-art LLM-based\n3D interactive scene generation method, in Figure 16.\nBased on the four evaluation metrics detailed in the Ex-periment section, scenes generated by Scenethesis demon-\nstrate greater diversity in object categories, quantities,\nand sizes. More importantly, Scenethesis \u2019s scenes have\na broader range of spatial relationships, such as \u201con top\nof\u201d,\u201cinside\u201d , and \u201cunder\u201d , compared to those generated\nby Holodeck [ 48], which supports only \u201con top of\u201d spatial\nrelation. Furthermore, Scenethesis \u2019s scenes align more\nfaithfully with the intended scene type. i.e. when given the\ndescription \u201ca peaceful beach during sunset\u201d ,Scenethesis\nproduces an outdoor scene with appropriate beach ele-\nments, while Holodeck incorporates beach-related objects\nbut generates an environment resembling an indoor setting.\n5\n\nA living room with reading materials A private billiard room for relax A beautiful surf -fishing beach\nThe museum exhibition A warehouse space A reading cornerFigure 15.

In addition, Holodeck lacks visual perception and usually generates misoriented objects, e.g. shelves occlude the window in\nchildren playroom and warehouse, chair orients towards the window in the hospital case, hindering their functionalities.\n7\n\nA living room with reading materials\nA peaceful beach during sunsetA cute piano room A warm hospital ward\nA realistic laboratory scene\nA relax  beach  scene\nImage guidance Scenethesis  scene w.o./w. environment map Image guidance Scenethesis  scene w.o./w. environment mapFigure 17.

Note\nthatScenethesis focus on layout planning for objects on the ground. Additionally, certain unique assets, such as a beach mat, are unavailable\nin Objaverse [ 8], which may result in the generated scene differing from the image guidance. Future work could enhance the system by\nincorporating a wider range of assets.\n8\n\n7. Prompts Examples\n7.1.

A large object directly on the ground ( i.e. floor, table, or shelf).\n2.An object that influences where other objects are placed ( i.e. a table in a dining room, and there\nare cups and fruits on the table).\n3.The object should logically anchor the scene and often defines the scene\u2019s layout orientation. i.e.\nthe sofa in a front-facing view in the scene.\nStep 4: Object Cross-check\na.I will give you $100 tips if you can cross-check whether objects in the scene can be found in the given\ncategory list or its relevant categories. i.e., if there is a bookshelf in your planned scene, the bookshelf\nshould also be found in the given list, or bookcase can be found in the list if bookshelf is not covered by\nthe category. Otherwise, re-plan the scene.\nStep 5: Plan Scene with Selected Objects\na. Based on the description and selected objects, plan the scene, keeping these aspects in mind:\ni.Functionality : Choose objects that are contextually relevant to the scene (e.g., selecting a table,\nchair, flower vase, and utensils for a dining room), but do not generate any wall d \u00b4ecor objects.\nii.Spatial Hierarchy :\n1.Please have a depth effect in the layout. For the depth effect, the scene should have some objects\nplaced on the ground as the background, central, and in the front, resulting in a depth layout. i.e.\nthe sofa and bookshelf are the background of the table and chair set in the living room.\n2.Please have a supportive item in the layout. i.e. the shoes, bag, and hat are in the display shelf in\na clothes store, where the display shelf is a supportive item.\niii.Balance : Ensure a mix of large and small objects to avoid overcrowding or under-populating the\nscene. i.e. taking the table as the center, there are flower vases, fruits, and cups on the table, and\nchairs are on the sides.\nStep 6: Output Format:\na. Save the selected objects as a json file follow the output format:\nAnchor object :\nOther common objects :\nb. Save scene planning as txt file.\n9\n\n7.2.

Instruction for Evaluating Generated Scenes\nGPT-4o Evaluation Prompts for Generated Scenes\nEvaluate Generated Scenes for Scenethesis and Holodeck\nThis is a hard problem. You are supposed to compare the alignment of a pair of images with a given text prompt that\ndescribe the scene. Images contain generated scenes by two different methods. Please evaluate them in the following\nfive aspects:\n1.Object diversity : Counting number of object and object types in the scene. The higher number, the better object\ndiversity. i.e. if there are three shelves and a box in the scene. Then the object type is 2 and the number of counting\nis 3+1 = 4.\n2.Layout coherence : whether the objects position and orientation in the scene are realistic and adhere to common\nsense.\n\u2022An ideal layout would be dependents on the scene type. i.e. the objects in the garage scene will forms as a bit\nchaotic organization and it would be less reasonable if all objects standing against the wall in a very clean order.\n\u2022 Objects should be placed reasonably. i.e. shelves fly in the air or hange on the wall.\n3.Spatial realism & complexity : whether scene contains diverse hierarchy. The measure of spatial complexity\nis by review scenes and carefully evaluate objects relations. The higher diverse relation indicate a better spatial\ncomplexity. The spatial hierarchy refers to the following aspects:\n\u2022 relations such as on the top of, in side of, under the, etc.\n\u2022objects in various sizes. i.e. the scene should contain large objects such as shelf and small objects such as apple.\n\u2022objects that are arranged in different area and form a depth effects. i.e. objects are in the background, in the front,\nand in the center of the space.\n4.Overall performance : assets\u2019 categorizes and styles are faithful to the scene type. i.e. fruits are less likely in\nthe warehouse, while carts, boxes are more likely in a warehouse scene. Thus, it would be a bad performance if\nfind fruits in the warehouse and good performance if cartsshelfboxes presents in the warehouse. Please carefully\nevaluate the object\u2019s category and scene type. To see whether it is reasonable enough based on your common sense.\n5.Please ignore aspects in : environment background style such as lighting, shadow, color, and decorations in the wall\netc. This is a challenging task, please think aloud and make your decisions by:\n\u2022 analyzing each criteria one by one for each image.\n\u2022 report your evaluation results based on the analysis.\n6. Your output format should be: {}is better than {}in the criteria {}.\n11\n\n7.4. Evaluation Example of Generated Scenes\nGPT-4o Evaluation Results\nScenethesis\u2019s Scene\n1.Object diversity :\n\u2022 Objects visible: Ladder, barrel, boxes, fire extinguisher, table, tire, crate.\n\u2022 Object types: 8 types. Total count: 13\n\u2022 Higher diversity due to various objects.\n2.Layout coherence :\n\u2022 Objects are dispersed naturally, suggesting activity.\n\u2022 Different sizes and a less structured arrangement suggest a more realistic warehouse scene.\n3.Spatial realism & complexity :\n\u2022 Objects have various spatial relations; ladder stands, boxes on ground, tables at center...\n\u2022 Good diversity with a mix of background and central objects.\n4.Overall performance :\n\u2022 Varied objects like ladders, barrels, crates, and extinguishers are typical in a warehouse.\n\u2022 Realistic depiction of a warehouse setting.\nHolodeck\u2019s Scene\n1.Object diversity :\n\u2022 Objects visible: Shelves, cabinets, safety vests, and workbenches.\n\u2022Object types: Shelves, cabinets, vests, workbenches. Total count: 7+2=9 (shelves are considered per structure, as\nare others).\n\u2022 Diversity is somewhat low as there are few types.\n2.Layout coherence :\n\u2022 Organization is neat; workbenches and cabinets are along the walls.\n\u2022 Reasonable layout for a tidy scene, but lacks variety in sizes.\n3.Spatial realism & complexity :\n\u2022 Shelving and cabinets against walls create vertical space; workbenches on the ground.\n\u2022 Lacks diverse spatial relations.\n4.Overall performance : Objects like shelves and workbenches fit a warehouse setting, but it lacks variety typical in\nlarger-scale warehousing.\nEvaluation\nObject diversity :Scenethesis is better than Holodeck; Layout coherent :Scenethesis is better than Holodeck;\nSpatial realism & complexity :Scenethesis is better than Holodeck; Overall performance :Scenethesis is better than\nHolodeck.\n12\n\n7.5. Instruction Prompts for Ablation Study\nPose Alignment Evaluation Instruction Prompt\nThis task involves evaluating the pose alignment between two images in a pair. One image serves as the image guidance\n(GT), while the other is a generated image. Your objective is to measure the pose alignment of the generated image\nrelative to the GT image. Follow these steps for evaluation:\n1.Review Objects in the GT Image : Examine all objects in the GT image, focusing on their locations, sizes, and\norientations. Understand the spatial relationships among objects, such as on top of ,inside ,under , etc.\n2.Evaluate pose alignment : Assess the similarity between the generated image and the GT image based on the\nfollowing three aspects:\n\u2022Location and Size Similarity: Compare the location and size of objects in the generated image with those in the\nGT image. Assign a similarity score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates the highest similarity. For example:\n\u2013If an apple in the GT image is placed at the center of a table, and in the generated image it is placed on the left\nside of the table, the similarity might be moderate (e.g., 0.5).\n\u2013If the apple is misplaced (e.g., on the ground or missing entirely), the similarity would be very low (e.g., 0.1).\n\u2022Orientation Similarity: Examine the orientation of each object in the generated image compared to the GT image.\nPay close attention to details, noting any deviations such as slight tilts (e.g., right/left, up/down) or rotations that\ncreate different perspectives. Assign a score from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect alignment and 0 indicates a\nsignificant mismatch (e.g., opposite orientation).\n\u2022Overall Layout Similarity: Assess the overall visual coherence of the generated image compared to the GT image,\nincluding spatial relationships and hierarchical structure. Assign a similarity score between 0 and 1, where 1\nrepresents a perfect match. For instance:\n\u2013A perfect match occurs when the generated image maintains the same spatial relationships, relative locations,\nsizes, and orientations as the GT image (e.g., an apple placed at the center of a table in both images).\n\u2013Small deviations in placement or orientation are acceptable but should result in a lower score.\n3.Exclusions : Do not consider style, appearance, object shape, or texture in your evaluation. Focus solely on pose\nalignment.\n4.Output Format : Clearly document your similarity scores for each aspect (Location and Size Similarity, Orientation\nSimilarity, and Overall Layout Similarity) following the format: location and size similarity score is {}, orientation\nsimilarity score is {}, and overall layout similarity score is {}. Please save the evaluated scores as a json file.\n13\n\nReferences\n[1]Rio Aguina-Kang, Maxim Gumin, Do Heon Han, Stew-\nart Morris, Seung Jean Yoo, Aditya Ganeshan, R Kenny\nJones, Qiuhong Anna Wei, Kailiang Fu, and Daniel Ritchie.\nOpen-universe indoor scene generation using llm program\nsynthesis and uncurated object databases. arXiv preprint\narXiv:2403.09675 , 2024. 3\n[2]Aleksei Bochkovskii, Ama \u00a8el Delaunoy, Hugo Germain, Mar-\ncel Santos, Yichao Zhou, Stephan R Richter, and Vladlen\nKoltun.

Unlike genuine quantum crystals that\narise from interparticle interactions, Pauli crystals do not break translation symmetry but nonethe-\nless exhibit nontrivial many-body correlations. In this Letter, we explore Pauli crystal formation in\na cavity-fermion setup. We analytically show that when coupled to a cavity, degeneracy in Pauli\ncrystals can trigger zero-threshold transitions to superradiance. This superradiance is accompanied\nby the emergence of a genuine quantum crystalline state, wherein the atomic density is periodically\nmodulated. We substantiate our findings using state-of-the-art numerical simulations. The com-\nbined interplay between statistics, confinement geometry and interactions mediated by light thus\nfacilitates a novel pathway to quantum crystallization.\nA quantum crystal is a state characterized by sponta-\nneously broken translation symmetry in free space and\nstrong zero-point fluctuations about its equilibrium po-\nsition [1]. Interparticle interactions lie at the core of\nsuch crystallization phenomena triggered by the competi-\ntion between two energy scales, associated with distinct\nground states of a many-body system. Crystal states\narise in both bosonic and fermionic systems and well-\nknown examples in the condensed matter realm include\nrare gas crystals [2], molecular solids, Wigner crystals [3],\nRydberg crystals [4, 5], or supersolids [6, 7]. In the past\ndecade, quantum engineered systems have emerged as a\nplatform of choice to explore diverse facets of crystalliza-\ntion [8].\nA complementary pathway to crystallization is pro-\nvided by confinement of long-range interacting quantum\nsystems, as evinced by the emergence of complex states\nlike bilayer ion crystals [9], molecular dipolar crystals in\nbosonic and fermionic gases [10], and mesoscopic super-\nsolids [11\u201314] among others. Nonetheless, interactions\nremain the key to such crystallization. Curiously, in\nthe opposite limit of zero interactions, strong confine-\nment of fermions leads to the formation of quantum geo-\nmetric structures known as Pauli crystals [15\u201317]. They\nmanifest complex symmetries in position and momen-\ntum spaces in high-order correlations resembling crystals\nat ultra-low temperatures, but without spontaneously\nbreaking translational symmetry as real crystals. They\nare thus a pure manifestation of Fermi statistics in con-\nfined geometries, wherein statistics induces many-body\ncorrelations. Pauli crystals have recently been observed\nusing a few ultra-cold spin-polarized fermionic6Li atoms\nconfined to a tight harmonic trap [18].\nUnderstanding how interactions influence Pauli crys-\ntals\u2013and how they interplay with correlations arising\nfrom quantum statistics\u2013poses a natural extension of cur-rent studies. A promising arena to explore such physics is\nthe hybrid platform of laser-pumped cold gases coupled\nto high-finesse optical cavities [19]. The tunable cavity-\nmatter coupling induced by the laser with wavelength\n\u03bbcreates effective atom-atom interactions that, compet-\ning with kinetic energy, favor a \u03bb-periodic checkerboard\nmodulation of the atomic density over a uniform distri-\nbution [20]. At a critical coupling, the system undergoes\naZ2symmetry breaking quantum phase transition to a\nself-ordered superradiant crystalline state [Fig. 1(a,b)],\nwhich scatters light efficiently into the cavity, rendering\nit a coherent state. The predicted superradiance and\nthe associated density modulations were observed exper-\nimentally for both bosonic [21, 22] and fermionic sys-\ntems [23, 24].\nWhile prior studies focused exclusively on bulk sys-\ntems and their phase transitions, in this Letter we tar-\nget the opposite regime of low densities of tightly con-\nfined degenerate fermions. We show that Fermi statistics\ninduced correlations inherent to two-dimensional Pauli\ncrystals may dramatically enhance the susceptibility to\nsuperradiance via zero-threshold transitions to superradi-\nant quantum crystals [Fig. 1(c)], termed soft transitions.\nUsing a box potential which admits simple analytical\ntreatments while being experimentally accessible [25, 26],\nwe present analytical criteria dictating the existence of\nsuch soft transitions for different fermion numbers and\nextents of confinement. Compared to conventional Dicke\nsuperradiance [27\u201330], these soft transitions take advan-\ntage of symmetry breaking within a degenerate subspace\naccessed through Pauli exclusion [16], and do not need\nto overcome a kinetic energy barrier. We consolidate\nour analytical results with in-depth numerical simula-\ntions using high-performance computing methods, which\nmap out the full phase diagram (Fig. 2) and the associ-\nated observables (Fig. 3). The mechanism we explore isarXiv:2505.02837v1  [cond-mat.quant-gas]  5 May 2025\n\n2\nFIG. 1.

Otherwise, the system exhibits usual Dicke superra-\ndiance between eigenmodes with different energies (dashed\narrows). (f)(Anti-)symmetric superposition of Pauli crystals\ncorrespond to a squeezed Fermi sea along directions of q\u00b1\nwhich scatters light in the form of a coherent state |\u2213\u03b1\u27e9.\ninherently different from Umklapp superradiance, where\nthe momentum transfer required for self-ordering is fine\ntuned to coincide with the size of the Fermi sphere [31\u2013\n33] in fermionic systems coupled to a cavity.\nWe consider Nspinless fermions of mass min a two di-\nmensional square box of side length Lcoupled to a single-\nmode cavity with resonance frequency \u03c9c, wavevector kc,\nand maximal single-atom dispersive shift U0, as sketched\nin Fig. 1(a). The atoms are driven by two counter-\npropagating transverse pump laser fields with orthogo-\nnal polarizations, frequency \u03c9p, wavevector kp, and lat-\ntice depth V0. We consider the cavity and pump share\nthe same wavelength \u03bb= 2\u03c0/|kp|= 2\u03c0/|kc|, and are di-\nrected along the xandydirections, respectively. The\ncoupling to the cavity introduces a recoil process, wherea recoil momentum \u00b1q\u00b1=\u00b1(kp\u00b1kc) is transferred be-\ntween two atoms [34, 35], which by construction fulfill\nq+\u00b7q\u2212= 0. In the dispersive regime, the atomic excited\nstate can be adiabatically eliminated, and we obtain the\nfollowing effective Hamiltonian in the frame rotating at\n\u03c9p(\u210f= 1):\n\u02c6H=Z\ndx\u02c6\u03a8\u2020(x)\u0014\n\u2212\u22072\n2m+\u02c6Vtrap(x) +U0\u02c6a\u2020\u02c6asin2(kcx)+\np\nU0V0(\u02c6a+ \u02c6a\u2020) sin(kpx) sin(kcx)\u0015\n\u02c6\u03a8(x)\u2212\u2206c\u02c6a\u2020\u02c6a.(1)\nHere, \u02c6 aand\u02c6\u03a8(x) denote the annihilation operators for\nthe cavity and atomic fields, satisfying [\u02c6 a,\u02c6a\u2020] = 1 and\n{\u02c6\u03a8(x),\u02c6\u03a8\u2020(x\u2032)}=\u03b4(x\u2212x\u2032), respectively; while \u2206 c=\n\u03c9c\u2212\u03c9pis the cavity detuning. In this Letter, we consider\na specific implementation of \u03b2= 2L/\u03bb\u22082Z+, where\nthe cavity-atom system has a Z2symmetry \u02c6 a\u2192 \u2212 \u02c6a,\n(x, y)\u2192(L\u2212x, y), with an associated parity operator\n\u02c6Pwhich is also reflected between the recoil momenta\nq+\u2192q\u2212. The square box trap imposes a symmetry of\nthe group D4, which is equipped with a degenerate irre-\nducible representation facilitating the breaking of parity.\nThis manifests as soft transitions and is straightforwardly\ngeneralizable to other symmetries.\nThe atoms are subject to boundary condition ( x, y)\u2208\n[0, L]2imposed by the square box potential \u02c6Vtrap(x).\nThis imposes the atomic eigenmode structure |nx, ny\u27e9=\n|nx\u27e9\u2297|ny\u27e9where the associated real space wavefunctions\nare\u03c8ni(xi) =q\n2\nLsin\u0000ni\u03c0xi\nL\u0001\nwith ni\u2208N+, i\u2208 {x, y},\nand the energies are Enx,ny= (n2\nx+n2\ny)\u03c02/2mL2, see\nSupplemental Material (SM) [36]. In momentum space,\nthese states center around ( kx, ky) = ( nx, ny)\u03c0/L, and\nthus constitute an effective momentum lattice, as de-\npicted in Fig. 1(e). In the absence of coupling to the\ncavity, the fermions fill the Nlowest eigenmodes, and the\nmany-body ground state is thus constructed by the cor-\nresponding Slater determinant. These states form the ge-\nometrical structures of the fermions known as Pauli crys-\ntals [16]. As elaborated in the SM, there are two classes\nof ground states: closed- andopen-shell configurations\ndepending on whether the ground state\u2019s most energetic\nparticle is in a filled (unique ground state) or partially\nfilled energy level (degenerate ground states). Closed-\nshell configurations have momentum distributions which\nare invariant under ki\u2192 \u2212 kiwith i\u2208 {x, y}, whereas\ndegenerate open-shell configurations host superposition\nstates that violate this symmetry [36].\nBeyond a critical coupling to the cavity, the bulk sys-\ntem undergoes a Z2symmetry-breaking Dicke-type tran-\nsition from a normal to a superradiant phase [21, 37].\nIn this phase, atoms self-organize into a checkerboard\nconfiguration dictated by the recoil processes q\u00b1. In-\ntriguingly, the Pauli crystal coupled to a cavity may host\nsoft superradiant transitions immediately at infinitesimal\n\n3\ncavity-atom couplings. This distinction can be captured\nby a perturbation analysis. To lowest order in the cavity-\natom coupling, the atoms effectively apply a displace-\nment force to the cavity\u2019s harmonic oscillator mode, see\nSM [36],\n\u02c6Hc=\u2212e\u2206c\u02c6a\u2020\u02c6a+p\nU0V0(F+\u2212F\u2212)(\u02c6a+ \u02c6a\u2020),(2)\nwhere e\u2206c= \u2206 c\u2212 B <0 is an effective cavity de-\ntuning defined through bunching parameter B[36],\nand F\u03b3=F(q\u03b3)\u2261 \u22121\n4P\ns\u2208\u00b1R\ndk\u27e8\u02c6\u03a8\u2020\nk+sq\u03b3\u02c6\u03a8k\u27e9.\nThe atomic order parameter F+\u2212F\u2212 =R\ndx\u27e8\u02c6\u03a8\u2020(x)\u02c6\u03a8(x)\u27e9sin(kpx) sin(kcx) reflects the atomic\nconfiguration in the absence of the cavity.\nThe abundant configurations of Pauli crystals provide\nan opportunity to spontaneously break the symmetry be-\ntween q\u00b1. In a closed-shell Pauli crystal, where the most\nenergetic fermion is in a fully occupied energy level, the\nground state is unique. In this case, the ground state\ninherits the same Z2symmetry from the Hamiltonian,\nand has vanishing atomic order parameter, F+=F\u2212.\nCorrespondingly, the cavity field is not macroscopically\nexcited \u27e8\u02c6a\u27e9= 0. Similar arguments apply for bulk Bose-\nEinstein condensates and Fermi gases as well, whose con-\nfigurations are characterized by a uniform distribution.\nHowever, in an open-shell crystal, where the most en-\nergetic level is partially filled, the ground state is two-\nfold degenerate (See SM [36]), and the ground state does\nnot necessarily retain the symmetry of the Hamiltonian.\nThis configuration is potentially associated with a finite\natomic order parameter F+\u0338=F\u2212through a deformation\nof the occupied k-space along the dominant momenta\nq\u00b1while keeping its volume, which we term Fermi sea\nsqueezing, triggering a soft transition to superradiance\n[Fig. 1(f)].\nTo further unveil the interplay between cavity-\nmediated interactions and statistics in few-body systems,\nwe proceed to the atomic perspective, and rewrite the\ncavity-atom coupling in the basis spanned by the atomic\neigenmodes |n\u27e9=|nx, ny\u27e9\n\u02c6Hint=p\nU0V0(\u02c6a+ \u02c6a\u2020)X\nn,mWnx,mxWny,my|n\u27e9\u27e8m|,(3)\nwith Wn\u00b5,m\u00b5=\u27e8n\u00b5|sin(2\u03c0\u02c6\u00b5/\u03bb)|m\u00b5\u27e9,\u00b5=x, y, eval-\nuated as Wn,m= 4[1 \u2212(\u22121)m+n]\u03b2mn/ [\u03c0(\u03b22\u2212m2\u2212\nn2)2\u22124\u03c0m2n2]. The cavity-atom coupling effectively\nintroduces hoppings between atomic eigenmodes on the\nsynthetic momentum lattice [38]. The onset of superra-\ndiance depends on the fermion most susceptible to this\neffective coupling. In a closed-shell crystal, the couplings\nmost relevant to superradiance are those connecting filled\neigenmodes |n1x, n1y\u27e9with empty ones |n2x, n2y\u27e9. Each\neigenmode pair can be regarded as a two-level Dicke\nmodel with critical coupling controlled by the energy dif-\nferences and the effective couplings between them. The\nsmallest critical coupling among all these pairs is thus\n1/4 1/2 3/4 1 5/4 3/2 7/4\n\u03bd0.00.51.01.52.0V0[Er]\n10\u2212610\u2212410\u22122100102104\n|\u03b1|21 3 5 7 9 11 13 15NFIG. 2.

Zero threshold transitions take\nplace when the most energetic fermion of an open-shell Pauli\ncrystal is susceptible to the cavity, as illustrated by the colored\nlinks in Fig. 1(d). For guide of eyes and comparison, dots\nmark the (arbitrary) |\u03b1|2= 1 threshold, while the dashed\nline shows the threshold if the system were bosonic.\nthe critical coupling of the Pauli crystal. Due to the fi-\nnite energy differences between every pair, the critical\ncoupling is non-zero.\nAn open-shell crystal, however, provides a more subtle\nstructure because its low-energy atomic dynamics take\nplace predominantly in a subspace spanned by the de-\ngenerate eigenmodes |na, nb\u27e9and|nb, na\u27e9, see SM [36].\nWhen na+nbis even, Wna,nb= 0. The degener-\nate eigenmodes destructively interfere with each other\nthrough the recoil process, and the cavity does not me-\ndiate couplings within the degenerate subspace. How-\never, when na+nbis odd and thus Wna,nb\u0338= 0, the\ncavity-mediated coupling lifts the degeneracy, and se-\nlects the states ( |na, nb\u27e9 \u00b1 |nb, na\u27e9)/\u221a\n2 most compatible\nwith its recoil wavevectors q\u00b1to maximize the atomic\norder parameter |F+\u2212F\u2212|toW2\nna,nb. Consequently, the\ntwo-fold degenerate Pauli crystal-cavity states |1\u27e9a\u2297|0\u27e9c\nand|2\u27e9a\u2297 |0\u27e9cwhere |1\u27e9a,|2\u27e9aand|0\u27e9cdenote the two\nPauli crystal configurations and the vacuum cavity state\nrespectively, split into four states: two lowest energy\nstates |\u2212\u27e9a\u2297 |\u03b10\u27e9cand|+\u27e9a\u2297 |\u2212\u03b10\u27e9cand two excited\nstates |\u2212\u27e9a\u2297 |\u2212\u03b10\u27e9cand|+\u27e9a\u2297 |\u03b10\u27e9cwhere |\u00b1\u27e9ais the\n(anti-)symmetric superposition of |1\u27e9aand|2\u27e9aand|\u03b10\u27e9c\nis a coherent state of the cavity. Each new ground state\nis one of the Z2configurations with the momentum dis-\ntribution of the atoms squeezed along q\u00b1, leading to\na non-zero expectation value for the cavity. In con-\ntrast to the nondegenerate eigenmodes with fixed parity\n\u27e8\u02c6P\u27e9=\u00b11,the degeneracy generates states with varying\nparities \u27e8\u02c6P\u27e9 \u2208[\u22121,1], which allows the cavity-atom cou-\npling to break the parity maximally with \u27e8\u00b1|\u02c6P|\u00b1\u27e9a= 0.\nTo verify our theory of Pauli-crystallinity-assisted\nsoft superradiant transitions, we perform numeri-\ncal simulations using the Multiconfigurational Time-\n\n4\nDependent Hartree Method for Indistinguishable Parti-\ncles (MCTDH-X) [39\u201343], see SM [36]. MCTDH-X has\nbeen successfully applied to analyzing static and dynamic\nproperties of cavity-boson systems [38, 44\u201346], but its ap-\nplication to two-dimensional fermionic systems [17, 40] is\nfar more computationally challenging due to the under-\nlying Slater determinant ansatz.\nSpecifically, we simulate an experimentally viable\nsetup of fermions in a box of size L= 2\u03bbcorresponding\nto\u03b2= 4 with particle number ranging N= 1,2, . . . , 15.\nThis corresponds to Nfermions that occupy a lattice\nwith 2 L2/\u03bb2=\u03b22/2 = 8 sites once superradiance starts,\nthus defining filling fraction as \u03bd=N/8 ranging from\n1/8 to 15 /8. The system parameters are inspired by\ncurrent experimental setup NU0=\u22122\u03c0\u00d75.22 MHz,\n\u2206c=\u22122\u03c0\u00d77.50 MHz, a wavelength of \u03bb= 780 nm\ncorresponding to a recoil energy of Er= 2\u03c0\u00d73.77 kHz,\nand a dissipation of \u03ba= 2\u03c0\u00d7147 kHz [47, 48]. The pump\nfield is red-detuned with respect to the atomic transition,\ni.e.V0, U0<0. The cavity is treated as a coherent state\n\u02c6a\u2192\u03b1=\u27e8\u02c6a\u27e9effectively providing a one-body potential,\nwhich follows the master equation \u2202t\u03b1=i\u27e8[\u02c6H,\u02c6a]\u27e9 \u2212\u03ba\u03b1.\nWe simulate the steady states for different values of V0\nbetween 0 and 2 Er. As summarized in Fig. 2, we observe\nthat the Pauli pressure significantly impacts the superra-\ndiance threshold, showing both soft and hard transitions.\nClosed-shell Pauli crystals : We first consider the spe-\ncific case of \u03bd=1\n2,N= 4, where superradiance is\nexpected to be induced by the recoil process |2,2\u27e9 \u2192\n(|1,3\u27e9\u00b1|3,1\u27e9)/\u221a\n2 at a finite critical point. Our numerical\nsimulations indeed confirm the absence of a soft transi-\ntion. The real and momentum space densities at different\nV0are summarized in Fig. 3(a). As V0increases from 0\nto\u223c1.15Erjust below the superradiant threshold, both\nthe Pauli crystal in position and momentum space re-\nmain unaffected. The onset of superradiance takes place\nalready at V0\u223c1.15Er, earlier than the bosonic thresh-\nold (dashed blue line in Fig. 2). Consequently, the atoms\neffectively deform in momentum space along one of the\ntwoq\u00b1vectors; the extent of this deformation is now\ncomparable to its magnitude \u223cqand the cavity becomes\npopulated by a coherent state. As V0increases, the atoms\nscatter to even higher eigenmodes and contribute to su-\nperradiance. Finally, at large V0\u223c1.8Ereach fermion\nlocalizes in an individual minimum of the scattering lat-\ntice with a concomitant delocalization in \u03c1(k). These\nconclusions qualitatively hold for all closed-shell config-\nurations irrespective of the specfic fermion density. Our\nsimulations show that this threshold has a V-shaped de-\npendence on the filling \u03bdwith the required critical cou-\npling exhibiting a minimum at \u03bd= 1. This feature is\ncompatible with Refs. [31, 33].\nOpen-shell Pauli crystals : In our implementation with\n\u03b2= 4 and within our range of particle numbers, open\nshell configurations arise at the following filling fractions:\n\u03bd=2\n8,5\n8,7\n8,9\n8,12\n8,14\n8.

The real ( \u03c1(x))\nand momentum space densities ( \u03c1(k)) of Pauli crystals at\n\u03bd= 1/2,7/8,3/2 are shown together with the values of |\u03b1|2\nin log scale (colorbars) at different values of V0. The densi-\nties are shown in x, y\u2208[0,2\u03bb] and kx, ky\u2208[\u22124\u03c0/\u03bb, 4\u03c0/\u03bb],\nand normalized to the corresponding maximum value. The\nblue dashed lines in the |\u03b1|2colorbar at V0= 1.5Erindicate\nthe bosonic threshold. (a)\u03bd= 1/2, N= 4closed-shell : Su-\nperradiance is achieved beyond critical pump strength. (b)\n\u03bd= 7/8, N= 7 open-shell subject to cavity : Soft transition\nis achieved at vanishing pump strength, while the system lo-\ncalizes only at large pump strengths. (c)\u03bd= 3/2, N= 12:\nopen-shell not subject to cavity : Soft transition is not achieved,\nand the system enters superradiance only at strong pump\nstrengths.\ncavity field mediates soft superradiant transitions when\nthe most energetic fermion occupies eigenmodes |na, nb\u27e9\n(or|nb, na\u27e9) with na+nbbeing odd. This includes:\n\u03bd=1\n4,N= 2 where ( na= 1, nb= 2), \u03bd=7\n8,N= 7\nwith ( na= 3, nb= 2), \u03bd=9\n8with ( na= 4, nb= 1) and\n\u03bd=7\n4,N= 14 with ( na= 3, nb= 4). In Fig. 1(e), we\nshow the strength of Wconnecting the different elements\non the momentum lattice. We see that its magnitude\nis maximal for states in the vicinity of \u03bd= 1 namely\n\n5\nfractions \u03bd=7\n8,9\n8and decreases for states with higher\nquantum numbers. Focusing on numerical simulations\nfor\u03bd=7\n8,N= 7, we obtain a small yet non-zero value\nof|\u03b1|2\u223c O\u0000\n10\u22123\u0001\nat zero threshold [Fig. 3(b)]. As V0\nincreases, the system smoothly crosses over into the su-\nperradiant phase where \u03b1grows and the atomic distribu-\ntions deform while largely preserving the Pauli crystalline\nstructure. This is in contrast to the usual second-order\nsuperradiant phase transition which is accompanied by\ndiverging fluctuations stemming from spontaneous sym-\nmetry breaking. Consequently, cavity fluctuations do not\ndiverge as V0approaches zero for the soft transitions.\nNote that beyond V0\u223c1.25Er, the Pauli crystal vastly\ndeforms as scattering to higher eigenmodes dominates\nand the distinction between open- and closed-shell con-\nfigurations become irrelevant.\nFor all the other open-shell configurations with even\nna\u00b1nb, the cavity does not mediate soft superradiant\ntransitions due to destructive interference Wna,nb= 0\nand thus lack of Fermi sea squeezing. In this case, the\nsuperradiance is again driven by the usual Dicke-type\nprocesses at finite critical couplings. Consider \u03bd=3\n2,\nN= 12, shown in Fig. 3(c) as an example. The open\nshell Pauli crystal remains in the normal phase at small\npump rates, because the soft transition is forbidden by\ndestructive interference between |2,4\u27e9and|4,2\u27e9. The\nonset of superradiance is mediated by the scattering from\n(|1,3\u27e9\u00b1|3,1\u27e9)/\u221a\n2 to (|2,4\u27e9\u00b1|4,2\u27e9)/\u221a\n2, accompanied by\nmacroscopic values for |\u03b1|2. As a result, the Pauli crystal\ndeforms into a dumbbell-shaped momentum density, as\nseen at V0\u223c1.5Er.\nWe emphasize that these soft transitions are intrin-\nsically precluded in one dimension, where the fermions\nonly occupy closed-shell and hence non-degenerate Pauli\ncrystal configurations. Moreover, these soft transitions\nare unrelated to Umklapp superradiance [31\u201333], and do\nnot require any fine tuning of the cavity wavelength.\nOur theoretical predictions can be tested in experi-\nmental setups, as all relevant ingredients are available\nstate-of-the-art technologies, even if not yet in the re-\nquired combination. This includes essentially the Pauli\ncrystal via strong confinement [18], the square box poten-\ntial via programmable spatial light modulators and digi-\ntal micromirror devices [26], and the cavity-fermion cou-\npling [23, 24]. Moreover, our predictions are qualitatively\nrobust against additional perturbations pertaining to re-\nalistic experimental realizations, e.g., a transverse pump\nstanding wave optical lattice potential Vp=V0sin2(kpx).\nAs shown in SM [36], this potential does not have any\nqualitative impact on the soft transitions in the regime\n\u03bd <1, but eliminates all soft transitions for \u03bd >1, re-\ncovering the usual finite threshold behavior for superradi-\nance. This can be inferred from the fact that when \u03bd >1,\nthis optical lattice potential induces an extra energy cost\nas the fermion distributions get denser, eliminating the\ndegeneracy.In summary, this Letter highlights novel emergent\nquantum many-body phenomena in a cavity-fermion sys-\ntem stemming from the interplay between Fermi statis-\ntics and confinement at the single particle level. Build-\ning on the elementary physics of a quantum particle in\na box, we unveil a pathway to zero-threshold ordered\nphases beyond the Landau paradigm. Extensions to sys-\ntems with internal degrees of freedom, tunable interac-\ntions, or spin-orbit coupling offer rich opportunities to\nuncover unconventional phases and collective excitations.\nOf particular interest is the potential to engineer mas-\nsive Nambu\u2013Goldstone modes [49, 50] by extending the\nsymmetry structure to continuous groups such as U(1),\ne.g., via crossed-cavity architectures [51]. These findings\nlay the groundwork for future experiments in quantum\ngas\u2013cavity platforms, where the effects of confinement,\nquantum statistics, and light-matter coupling can be pre-\ncisely controlled.\nD.O.-G. acknowledges funding from the ETH Research\nGrant.

As more fermions\nare added to a trap, Fermi statistics results in the emer-\ngence of distinct geometric structures in the ground state.\nThese Pauli crystals exhibit progressively smaller inter-\nparticle spacing with increasing particle number, leading\nto a more spread-out momentum distribution. Further-\nmore, symmetries of the trap lead to degeneracies and\nhence a continuum of equivalent Pauli crystal structures.\nThis aspect is highly relevant for the soft transitions dis-\ncussed in the main text.\nWe now discuss features of Pauli crystals in both posi-\ntion and momentum space for a square box of length L.\nWe start by writing down the eigenstates of the trap. As\nthe Schr\u00a8 odinger equation is separable in the coordinate\nprojections xandy, it suffices to obtain position and mo-\nmentum space densities in 1D. For a box of length L, the\neigenstates in position and momentum space are given\nby (n= 1,2,3, . . .)\n\u03c8n(x) =r\n2\nLsin\u0010n\u03c0\nLx\u0011\n, (S1)\n\u03c8n(k) =1\n2ir\nL\n\u03c0\"\n(\u22121)nsinc\u0012kL\u2212n\u03c0\n2\u0013\n\u2212sinc\u0012kL+n\u03c0\n2\u0013#\neikL/ 2, (S2)\nwhere sinc( x) = sin( x)/xis the cardinal sine function,\nwhich satisfies lim L\u2192\u221eLsinc(kL) = \u03b4(k). The 2D\neigenfunctions are \u03d5n(x) =\u03c8nx(x)\u03c8ny(y) with the label\nn\u2261(nx, ny) ordered by increasing eigenenergy\nEn=(n2\nx+n2\ny)\u03c02\n2mL2. (S3)\nFor example, n= 1corresponds to (1 ,1),n= 2to (2,1),\nn= 4to (2,2), and so on as seen in Fig. S1. Note that\nfor some particle numbers we have a single (multiple)\nground state(s), where the most energetic fermion lies in\na closed (open) energy shell or level (see Fig. S1a). For\nexample, for N= 2, the ground state populates with its\nfirst fermion the state (1,1) but with the second it can\npopulate either the state (1,2), the (2,1) or a superposi-\ntion of both of them.\nThe full N-particle wavefunction can be written as a\nSlater determinant of the states \u03d5n. Moreover, it can be\nshown that the one-body density matrix \u03c1(x,x\u2032) and its\nFIG. S1. (a)Eigenenergies for the single-particle states in a\n2D square box \u03d5n(x).

The Pauli crystal densities for\na square box of size L= 2\u03bband varying particle num-\nberNare shown in Fig. S2. However, the open-shell\nPauli crystals marked with a red \u2217have multiple allowed\nconfigurations given by \u03c1(x) and \u03c1(k) for a given par-\nticle number. In the next section, we show this has an\neffect on the soft-transition superradiance presented in\nthe main text.\nDEGENERACY OF PAULI CRYSTALS AND\nSUPERRADIANCE\nHere we focus on the open shell Pauli crystals and their\nimplications for the zero-threshold soft-transition super-\nradiance from the main text. Since we deal with degener-\nate energy levels, we use perturbation theory to see which\ncrystal is \u2018selected\u2019 by the cavity.\nWe consider a system in a trap with Nparticles, where\nthe first N\u22121 particles completely fill the lower energy\nlevels and the last particle lies in an empty two-fold de-\ngenerate energy level.

S2. Analytically calculated Pauli crystals of N= 1 to N= 16 fermions in a 2D box with x, y\u2208[0,2\u03bb] in position\n(top) and momentum (bottom) space. Particle numbers marked with a red \u2217are open-shell Pauli crystals with the most\nenergetic fermion occupying occupying a superposition of configurations, where one possibility is shown here. In particular, the\nsymmetric superposition of eigenmodes ( |na, nb\u27e9+|nb, na\u27e9)/\u221a\n2 takes the following values: We have for N= 2: na= 1,nb= 2,\nforN= 3: na= 1, nb= 3, for N= 5: na= 1, nb= 3, for N= 7: na= 2, nb= 3, for N= 9: na= 1, nb= 4, for N= 12:\nna= 2,nb= 4 and for N= 14: na= 3,nb= 4. For na+nbodd, both \u03c1(x) and \u03c1(k) are elongated/squeezed along the positive\ndiagonal, while for na+nbeven, they are equally deformed along both diagonals. All densities have been normalized to their\nmaximum value.\nof a square box like the one from the main text or the\nprevious section. However, the treatment here is more\ngeneral and could be further generalized to larger degen-\neracies. We denote by |1\u27e9and|2\u27e9the many-body degen-\nerate states of the Nparticles, |1\u27e9= \u02c6c\u2020\nd1QN\u22121\n\u2113=1\u02c6c\u2020\n\u2113|vac\u27e9\nand|2\u27e9= \u02c6c\u2020\nd2QN\u22121\n\u2113=1\u02c6c\u2020\n\u2113|vac\u27e9where \u02c6 c\u2020\niis a fermion cre-\nation operator in the i-th single particle state and [ d1]\nand [d2] index the degenerate single particle states in the\nlast shell. The corresponding Pauli crystal densities can\nbe written in the single particle basis \u03d5\u2113(x) as\n\u03c11,2(x) =1\nN\"\n|\u03d5d1,d2(x)|2+N\u22121X\n\u2113=1|\u03d5\u2113(x)|2#\n. (S6)\nThese are two possible Pauli crystal but we can construct\na continuum of them by superpositions of the two last\nlevels.\nThe interaction Hamiltonian takes the form\n\u02c6V=Z\ndx\u02c6\u03a8\u2020(x)p\nU0V0(\u02c6a+ \u02c6a\u2020) sin(kpx) sin(kcx)\u02c6\u03a8(x).\n(S7)Within a degenerate subspace of \u02c6H0such as that spanned\nby{|1\u27e9,|2\u27e9}, this Hamiltonian takes the form of the ma-\ntrix\n\u02c6V=\u0012\u27e81|\u02c6V|1\u27e9 \u27e81|\u02c6V|2\u27e9\n\u27e82|\u02c6V|1\u27e9 \u27e82|\u02c6V|2\u27e9\u0013\n, (S8)\nintroducing an effective coupling between the two degen-\nerate basis states, and thus lifting the degeneracy. Upon\ndiagonalization in this subspace, we obtain the following\northonormal superposition states as new basis states,\n|\u03be(\u03b8, \u03c6)\u27e9= cos\u03b8\n2|1\u27e9+ei\u03c6sin\u03b8\n2|2\u27e9, (S9)\n|\u03b6(\u03b8, \u03c6)\u27e9= sin\u03b8\n2|1\u27e9 \u2212ei\u03c6cos\u03b8\n2|2\u27e9, (S10)\nwhich fulfill \u27e8\u03be|\u03b6\u27e9= 0 and can be mapped to antipodal\npoints in a Bloch sphere [see Fig. S3]. Here, |\u03be\u27e9and\n|\u03b6\u27e9are also degenerate crystals in the absence of cavity\ncoupling. In this basis, the matrix from Eq.

S3. Multiple Pauli crystal configurations due to a two-fold degenerate energy level (Analytically calculated). (a)Given\ntwo degenerate Pauli crystals |1\u27e9and|2\u27e9there exists a continuum of Pauli crystals that can be formed on the Bloch sphere.\nAntipodal states |\u03be\u27e9and|\u03b6\u27e9are orthogonal. Consider a trajectory on the Bloch sphere for the polar angle \u03b8\u2208[0, \u03c0].(b,c)\nContinuous set of Pauli crystals for N= 5,7 fermions in the Bloch sphere from (a) as a function of the polar angle \u03b8. In both\nparticle numbers, the crystals associated to |1\u27e9and|2\u27e9are the same up to x\u2194y.(d)Consider a trajectory in the Bloch\nsphere for the azimuthal angle \u03c6\u2208[0,2\u03c0).(e,f) Continuous set of Pauli crystals for N= 5,7 fermions in the Bloch sphere\nfrom (a) in the equator as a function of the azimuthal angle \u03c6. In all cases the position and momentum one-body densities\n(\u03c1(x) and \u03c1(k)) were normalized to have their maximum value being 1. \u03c1(x) plotted in range x, y\u2208[0, L] and \u03c1(k) plotted in\nrange kx, ky\u2208[\u22126\u03c0/L, 6\u03c0/L].\nwhere we have the freedom to choose ( \u03b8, \u03c6) such that the\noff-diagonal terms are zero. For our setup of a square\nbox, symmetry arguments indicate that |1\u27e9 \u2192 | 2\u27e9when\nthe spatial coordinates x\u2194y. Consequently, \u27e81|\u02c6V|1\u27e9=\n\u27e82|\u02c6V|2\u27e9, which in conjunction with the diagonalization\nrequirement \u27e8\u03be|\u02c6V|\u03b6\u27e9!= 0 leads to \u03b8=\u03c0/2. Now, if we\nwant to maximize the energy splitting\n\u27e8\u03be|\u02c6V|\u03be\u27e9=\u27e81|\u02c6V|1\u27e9+ Ren\nei\u03c6\u27e81|\u02c6V|2\u27e9o\n, (S12)\n\u27e8\u03b6|\u02c6V|\u03b6\u27e9=\u27e82|\u02c6V|2\u27e9 \u2212Ren\nei\u03c6\u27e81|\u02c6V|2\u27e9o\n, (S13)\nwe need to choose \u03c6accordingly. These expressions\nare further simplified by noting that both the poten-\ntial and the wavefunctions are oscillatory functions with\na wavelength commensurate with L. Defining \u2206 \u03c6=\narg\u27e81|\u02c6V|2\u27e9, we find that \u03c6=\u2212\u2206\u03c6and\u03c6=\u03c0\u2212\u2206\u03c6give\nthe maximal energy splitting if and when \u27e81|\u02c6V|2\u27e9 \u0338= 0.\nThe fact that \u03c6has two values reflects the two possible\nZ2symmetry-broken states corresponding to \u27e8\u02c6a\u27e9=\u00b1\u03b1.\nIf we consider the full quantum problem with the cavity\nin its ground state |0\u27e9c, the original two-fold degener-\nate states [Pauli crystals] |1\u27e9a\u2297 |0\u27e9cand|2\u27e9a\u2297 |0\u27e9csplit\ninto four states in the soft-transition case: two ground\nstates |\u03b6\u27e9a\u2297|\u03b1\u27e9cand|\u03be\u27e9a\u2297|\u2212\u03b1\u27e9cand two excited states|\u03b6\u27e9a\u2297|\u2212\u03b1\u27e9cand|\u03be\u27e9a\u2297|\u03b1\u27e9cwhere |\u03b1\u27e9is a coherent state of\nthe cavity. This splitting has important consequences for\nour system. Typically, a symmetry broken phase tran-\nsition is accompanied by the closing of a gap (or dissi-\npative gap in the open system case) [52]. The reason\nbehind this lies in the dimensionality of the asymptotic\nsubspace of the ground states (steady states of the dissi-\npative system): before the symmetry breaking transition\nthis space is one-dimensional [spanned by a single ground\nstate] and after a Znsymmetry is broken it should be-\ncome n-dimensional [spanned by nground states] [52, 53].\nHowever, in the soft-transition cases we have, the sym-\nmetry is immediately broken at zero threshold and the\nnumber of states spanning the asymptotic subspace re-\nmains two across this transition. This reflects the ab-\nsence of any gap closure at the transition and hence the\nabsence of cavity fluctuations in the soft-transition case\nas opposed to the usual superradiant transitions at a fi-\nnite non-zero threshold at other filling fractions.\n\n11\nCALCULATION OF W AND SUPERRADIANCE\nIN A BOX\nAs we saw in the previous section, the condition of\n\u27e81|\u02c6V|2\u27e9 \u0338= 0 leads to a degeneracy lifting of Pauli crystals\nin the presence of a minimal interaction Hamiltonian of\nthe form of the lattice associated to superradiance [See\nEq. (S7)]. In particular, we can directly calculate all\nmany-body matrix elements in terms of single-particle\nquantities. To do this we expand the field-operator as\n\u02c6\u03a8(x) =P\u221e\nn=1\u03d5n(x)\u02c6cnand use Wick\u2019s theorem given\nour Slater determinant state to obtain sums of individual\nintegrals, which we express as\n\u27e81|\u02c6V|1\u27e9=\u27e8d1|\u02c6V(1)|d1\u27e9+N\u22121X\nn=1\u27e8n|\u02c6V(1)|n\u27e9 (S14)\n\u27e82|\u02c6V|2\u27e9=\u27e8d2|\u02c6V(1)|d2\u27e9+N\u22121X\nn=1\u27e8n|\u02c6V(1)|n\u27e9 (S15)\n\u27e81|\u02c6V|2\u27e9=\u27e8d1|\u02c6V(1)|d2\u27e9, (S16)\nwhere \u02c6V(1)=\u221aU0V0(\u02c6a+ \u02c6a\u2020) sin(kp\u02c6x) sin(kc\u02c6x) is the\nsingle-particle interacting Hamiltonian in first quanti-\nzation and |n\u27e9is the single-particle n-th eigenstate of\nthe square box. Notice however that \u2200nwe must have\n\u27e8n|\u02c6V(1)|n\u27e9= 0, since otherwise even a single fermion in a\n2D box has a non-zero expectation value of the order pa-\nrameter for superradiance and thus trivially pre-breaks\ntheZ2symmetry.\nNonetheless, it is clear that our perturbation depends\non matrix elements of the form\n\u27e8n|sin(kp\u02c6x) sin(kc\u02c6x)|m\u27e9=Wnx,mxWny,my,(S17)\nwhere we have used the 90\u25e6transverse pump - cavity\nconfiguration to split the matrix element into 1D single-\nparticle matrix elements\nWn,m=\u27e8n|sin(2\u03c0\u02c6x/\u03bb)|m\u27e9 (S18)\n=2\nLZL\n0dxsin\u0010n\u03c0x\nL\u0011\nsin\u00122\u03c0x\n\u03bb\u0013\nsin\u0010m\u03c0x\nL\u0011\n,\n(S19)\nwith|kp(c)|= 2\u03c0/\u03bb.\nThis matrix element clearly depends on the relation\nofLto\u03bb. We thus define a measure of our box size\n\u03b2= 2L/\u03bb\u2208Z, such that Wn,m(\u03b2) has encoded within it\nthe dependency of the system\u2019s size in a single parame-\nter. This quantity is easily calculated by introducing two\nother matrix elements.

If this were not the case, \u27e8n|\u02c6V(1)|n\u27e9 \u0338=\n0 already at n= 1, therefore trivially pre-breaking the\nZ2symmetry for any particle number.

(S12-S13)\n\u27e8\u00b1|\u02c6V|\u00b1\u27e9a=\u00b1p\nU0V0(\u02c6a+ \u02c6a\u2020)W2\na,b(\u03b2), (S29)\nleading to a maximal splitting with states |\u03be\u27e9=|+\u27e9and\n|\u03b6\u27e9=|\u2212\u27e9where\n|\u00b1\u27e9=1\u221a\n2(|1\u27e9 \u00b1 |2\u27e9), (S30)\nwhich makes the most energetic fermion populate the\nopen-shell in a superposition state \u221d |a, b\u27e9 \u00b1 |b, a\u27e9. This\nleads to the superradiant states at zero V0threshold\n|+\u27e9a\u2297 |\u2212\u03b1\u27e9cand|\u2212\u27e9a\u2297 |\u03b1\u27e9c, i.e. the (anti-)symmetric\nsuperposition of Pauli crystals will correspond to a Z2\nbroken superradiant state with (positive) negative phase\nof light.\nNonetheless, this is a finite size effect induced by the\nconfining potential. It is clear from Eq.(S27) and \u03b2=\n2L/\u03bbthat lim L\u2192\u221eWn,m(\u03b2) = 0. This is consistent with\nthe lack of zero-threshold fermionic superradiance in 2D\nsystems in other theoretical works [31, 33] as well as in\nexperiments [23, 24].MOMENTUM DENSITY DEFORMATION AND\nSOFT-TRANSITION SUPERRADIANCE\nIn the previous sections, we obtained a quantitative ar-\ngument on a zero-threshold fermionic superradiant phase\ntransition based on a Pauli crystal degeneracy splitting\ndue to the Hamiltonian term associated with scattering\nof photons into the cavity. In this section we aim to give a\nphysical intuition behind the analytics previously shown.\nIn particular, we will show that this degeneracy split-\nting and a non-zero value of \u27e8\u02c6a\u27e9=\u03b1is associated to an\nelongation of the Fermi sea along the direction given by\neither of q\u00b1=kp\u00b1kc, the scattering wavevectors that\nsend photons to the cavity from the transverse pump\nlaser and vice-versa.\nWe start from the Hamiltonian from the main text\n\u02c6H=\u02c6H0\u2212(\u2206c\u2212\u02c6B)\u02c6a\u2020\u02c6a+\u02c6V (S31)\nwhere \u02c6H0contains the kinetic energy and trap terms,\n\u2206c=\u03c9p\u2212\u03c9c<0 is the cavity detuning, \u02c6B=R\ndx\u02c6\u03a8\u2020(x)U0sin2(kcx)\u02c6\u03a8(x) is called \u201cbunching param-\neter\u201d, which captures the dispersive shift of the cavity\nresonance, and \u02c6V\u221d\u02c6a+ \u02c6a\u2020is the interaction Hamilto-\nnian from Eq. (S7). By taking an expectation value of\nthis Hamiltonian with respect to the atomic ground state\n[Pauli crystal] we trace out the atomic degrees of freedom\nand obtain a Hamiltonian for a displaced harmonic oscil-\nlator (up to dropped constant terms)\n\u02c6Hc\u2261\u27e8\u02c6H\u27e9a(S32)\n=\u2212e\u2206c\u02c6a\u2020\u02c6a+p\nU0V0(F+\u2212F\u2212)(\u02c6a+ \u02c6a\u2020),(S33)\nwhere we introduced the effective cavity detuning e\u2206c=\n\u2206c\u2212 \u27e8\u02c6B\u27e9a<0 and total forcing term\n\u02c6Ftot=Z\ndx\u02c6\u03a8\u2020(x) sin(kpx) sin(kcx)\u02c6\u03a8(x), (S34)\nwhose expectation value \u27e8\u02c6Ftot\u27e9a=Ftot=F+\u2212F\u2212may\nlead to a non-zero expectation value of the cavity field \u03b1,\ni.e. it leads to zero-threshold superradiance.\nWe express this last operator in terms of a momentum\nspace representation:\n\u02c6Ftot=\u22121\n2X\n\u03b3\u2208{\u00b1}\u03b3Z\ndx\u02c6\u03a8\u2020(x) cos( q\u03b3x)\u02c6\u03a8(x) (S35)\n=\u22121\n4X\nq\u03b3\u2208{\u00b1q\u00b1}\u03b3Z\ndx\u02c6\u03a8\u2020(x)eiq\u03b3x\u02c6\u03a8(x),(S36)\nwhere we first used a trigonometric identity sin AsinB=\n\u2212P\n\u03b3cos(A+\u03b3B)/2. Later, we can expand the field op-\nerators as \u02c6\u03a8(x) =1\u221a\n2\u03c0R\ndkeikx\u02c6\u03a8kto change into a mo-\nmentum space expression, where the integral over space\n\n13\nwill lead to a Dirac delta \u03b4(k\u2212k\u2032+q\u03b3), resulting in\nFtot=\u22121\n4X\ns,\u03b3\u2208{\u00b1}\u03b3Z\ndk\u27e8\u02c6\u03a8\u2020\nk+sq\u03b3\u02c6\u03a8k\u27e9a (S37)\n=\u22121\n4X\ns,\u03b3\u2208{\u00b1}\u03b3Z\ndkN\u03c1(k+sq\u03b3,k) (S38)\n\u2261X\n\u03b3\u2208{\u00b1}\u03b3F\u03b3, (S39)\nwhere we first identified \u27e8\u02c6\u03a8\u2020\nk+q\u03b3\u02c6\u03a8k\u27e9a/N=\u03c1(k+q\u03b3,k)\nas the one-body density matrix in momentum space and\ndefined our forcing terms F+=F(q+) and F\u2212=F(q\u2212):\nF\u03b3=\u2212N\n4X\ns\u2208{\u00b1}Z\ndk\u03c1(k+sq\u03b3,k) (S40)\n=\u22121\n2Z\ndx\u27e8\u02c6\u03a8\u2020(x) cos( q\u03b3x)\u02c6\u03a8(x)\u27e9, (S41)\nwhere the last expression is an equivalent position space\nquantity. Notice that theR\ndk\u03c1(k+q\u03b3,k) from Eq. (S40)\nis a geometrical measure of the extent of \u03c1(k) along the\naxis given by q\u03b3. Moreover, it can be considered as an\naverage correlation of the momentum density at a point\nin momentum space k0with another one at k0+q\u03b3.\nOne can use the expression for F\u03b3from Eq. (S41) to-\ngether with the definitions in Eq. (S20) to analytically\nobtain the values for F\u00b1. This requires using the fact\nthat for \u03c3=\u00b11:Yn,m(\u03c3\u03b2) =Yn,m(\u03b2) and Wn,m(\u03c3\u03b2) =\n\u03c3Wn,m(\u03b2), as well as q\u03b3=kp+\u03b3kq= (\u03b3\u02c6x+ \u02c6y)\u03c0\u03b2/L .\nUsing the states that maximize the atomic subspace de-\ngeneracy splitting, one obtains:\nF\u03b3=\u22121\n2\"\n\u2213\u03b3W2\na,b+Ya,aYb,b\u00b1Y2\na,b\n+N\u22121X\nn=1Ynx,nxYny,ny#\n, (S42)\nwhich directly gives\nF+\u2212F\u2212=\u00b1W2\na,b(\u03b2), (S43)\nin agreement with our previous calculation from Eq.\n(S29).\nThe term Ftot=F+\u2212F\u2212, with opposite signs for in-\ndividual \u201cforces\u201d together with the form of the cavity\nHamiltonian from Eq. (S33) suggests that each scatter-\ning wavevector q\u00b1couples an elongation of the momen-\ntum distribution to a phase of the scattered light into\nthe cavity. Notice that the expression from Eq. (S40)\nholds for all momentum distributions while the one of\nEq. (S43) is specific to the distributions that maximize\nthe total forcing term. Moreover, this physical interpre-\ntation sheds light on why some degenerate Pauli crystals\ncan scatter light at zero threshold, while others cannot.Take for example the Pauli crystals for N= 5 (Fig. S3e)\nandN= 7 in a box (Fig. S3f). One can see that the mo-\nmentum space distributions associated to |\u03be\u27e9and|\u03b6\u27e9for\nN= 5 have equal elongation along the axes given by q\u00b1,\nwhile those of N= 7 are clearly elongated along each of\nthem. Furthermore, this gives background to the depen-\ndence of Wn,m(\u03b2) on the parity of n\u00b1mfrom Eq. (S27)\nfor even values of \u03b2. Different parity values of nx(y)and\nmx(y)(resulting in nx(y)\u00b1mx(y)being odd) makes part\nof the distribution of the Pauli crystal along the kx(ky)\ndirection be an odd function. This results in an elongated\ndistribution in momentum space, whereas if nx(y)\u00b1mx(y)\nis even, the momentum distribution is also even and no\nelongation is obtained.\nSIMULATIONS IN MCTDH-X\nIn the main text, the numerical tool MCTDH-X (Mul-\nticonfigurational Time-dependent Hartree method for In-\ndistinguishable particles) [40, 54, 55] was used to per-\nform simulations of fermions in a cavity. This open-\nsource code (available at [39]) has been extensively used\nto study cavity-boson systems in 1D and 2D [35, 45] and\ncavity-fermion systems in 1D [56]. The method considers\na Hamiltonian consisting of a one-body potential V(x)\nand a two-body interaction W(x,x\u2032), which can be, in\ngeneral, time-dependent:\n\u02c6H=Z\ndx\u02c6\u03a8\u2020(x)\u0012\n\u22121\n2m\u22072+V(x)\u0013\n\u02c6\u03a8(x)\n+1\n2Z\ndxdx\u2032\u02c6\u03a8\u2020(x)\u02c6\u03a8\u2020(x\u2032)W(x,x\u2032)\u02c6\u03a8(x\u2032)\u02c6\u03a8(x).(S44)\nMCTDH-X is based on the ansatz that a finite number\nof (time-dependent) single-particle orbitals can describe\nthe system\u2019s many-body state.\nConsider a system with Morbitals and Nparticles\nwhich are distributed over them. We define single orbital\npopulations as n1, . . . , n Msuch that N=PM\nk=1nk. We\ncan write the ansatz |\u03a6\u27e9as\n|\u03a6\u27e9=X\n{n}Cn(t)MY\nk=1\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\u0010\n\u02c6b\u2020\nk(t)\u0011nk\n\u221ank!\uf8f9\n\uf8fb|vac\u27e9, (S45)\nwith a field operator\n\u02c6\u03a8(x) =MX\nk=1\u03d5k(x;t)\u02c6bk(t), (S46)\nwhere n= (n1, n2, . . . , n M) and \u02c6b\u2020\nk(t) is a creation oper-\nator of a particle in the k-th orbital with a wavefunction\n\u03d5k(x;t). Here, \u02c6bk(t) encodes the particle statistics of the\nsystem, i.e., {\u02c6bk,\u02c6b\u2020\nj}=\u03b4k,jfor fermions. MCTDH-X is\na time-dependent variational method [57] to determine\n\n14\nboth the coefficients Cnand the Morbitals \u03d5k(x) in real\nor imaginary time. It is exact in the limit of infinite or-\nbitals, but in practice, a finite number Mof orbitals can\nbe sufficient.\nWhile Nbosons can be simulated in the Gross-\nPitaevskii limit using M= 1 orbital, Pauli exclusion\nprinciple demands that M\u2265N, where the lower bound\nis a Slater determinant state that cannot be used for\nan interacting system. Furthermore, simulations of even\nsmall numbers of fermions in 2D scale rapidly in particle\nnumber. Computational complexity scales as\u0000M+N+1\nM\u0001\n,\nmeaning this limit cannot be reached in practice for many\nsystems. Recently, the code has been updated to use\nHigh Performance Computing (HPC) techniques to make\nfeasible 2D simulations as the ones done for the main\ntext. In particular, Message Passing Interface (MPI) al-\nlows for parallelization of the computations using domain\ndecomposed orbitals (DDO).\nBy its nature, MCTDH-X is designed to address the\nSchr\u00a8 odinger equation for static, non-dissipative systems.\nHowever, it is possible to introduce a dissipative cavity as\nis done in the cavity module of MCTDH-X [58]. Consider\na Lindbladian consisting of the Hamiltonian from Eq.\n(S44), which also includes cavity photon creation (anni-\nhilation) operators \u02c6 a(\u02c6a\u2020), and a jump operator \u02c6L=\u03ba\u02c6a.\nIf we consider the mean-field limit \u02c6 a\u2192\u03b1=\u27e8\u02c6a\u27e9, the\nparticles have an evolution described by the variational\nprinciple applied to the MCTDH-X ansatz. Meanwhile,\nthe cavity field will evolve according to\n\u2202\n\u2202t\u03b1=iD\n[\u02c6H,\u02c6a]E\nc\u2212\u03ba\u03b1, (S47)\nwhere \u27e8\u00b7\u27e9ctakes an expectation value of the cavity op-\nerators in the mean-field limit. This equation of motion\nis solved to find the steady state solution at every time\nstep of the method.\nIn the main text, only spin-polarized fermions were\nconsidered, i.e. the only interactions between the atoms\nwere induced by the cavity photons. Since the mean-field\nlimit was taken for the cavity field, in the mathematical\nsense the system was non-interacting, meaning that in\nprinciple no more than Morbitals were needed. In the\nsimulations presented in the main text, for each particle\nnumber N, we fixed NU0= 2\u03c0\u00d75.22 MHz and calculated\nM=N+1 orbitals. The resultiing orbitals were obtained\nby performing successive relaxations in imaginary time\nuntil convergence was achieved for both the cavity field\n\u03b1(t) and the total energy E(t) =\u27e8H(t)\u27e9.\nSUPERRADIANCE TRANSITIONS FOR OTHER\nFILLING FRACTIONS \u03bd\nIn this section, we present the simulations for N=\n1,2, ...,15 particles which were not included in the main\ntext.

In the training\nphase, from an algorithmic perspective, the MRM provides reward signals for RL [ 47,34], directly\ninfluencing the stability and final outcomes of training. From a data perspective, a powerful MRM\nenables high-quality data filtering, improving data quality by removing noisy samples [ 66,29]. In\nthe inference phase, the MRM facilitates test-time scaling strategies, such as the best-of-N strategy,\nto select the optimal responses [ 51]. In the evaluation phase, a good MRM can serve as an evaluator\nto simplify the evaluation process, especially in open-ended scenarios [56].\nRecently, reinforcement learning [ 9,33] has gained widespread application in the post-training\nprocess of MLLMs [ 59], achieving remarkable improvements in traditional vision tasks [ 27,44],\nmultimodal reasoning tasks [ 17,36,31], video understanding tasks [ 11], and omni-tasks [ 69].\nCompared to traditional post-training strategies such as supervised fine-tuning and direct preference\noptimization [ 38], RL offers better generalization [ 6] and demonstrates the ability to induce long-term\nreasoning capabilities [ 9]. However, recent improvements in MRMs have primarily focused on\ndata [ 56,62] and structural aspects [ 66], with little discussion on whether RL can be used to introduce\nlong-term reasoning in order to improve multimodal reward modeling performance.\nIn this paper, we investigate whether RL algorithms can be applied to multimodal reward modeling\ntasks? Intuitively, the reward modeling problem can be transformed into a rule-based RL task, where\nthe input consists of a given question and two answers. The target of the policy is to decide which\nanswer is better. The reward during training can be obtained by comparing whether the model\u2019s\njudgment is consistent with the ground truth. Our goal is to enable the model to perform long-term\nreasoning and then provide the correct judgment. However, RL for reward modeling presents several\nunique challenges, and directly using traditional RL methods can easily cause training to collapse:\n1.Limitation of PPO [ 40] and Related Algorithms [ 42].PPO and related algorithms rely on\nclipping the loss function to ensure training stability. However, we observe that when the advantage\nis negative and the current policy differs significantly from the reference policy, simple clipping fails\nto prevent instability, which may cause the training process to diverge or even crash.\n2.Instability of Advantage Normalization. We observe that in the later stages of training, where\nthe majority of rewards in a single batch are either 1 or 0 with very low variance, the commonly used\nadvantage normalization technique (subtracting the mean and dividing by the variance) in algorithms\nsuch as GRPO [ 42] and Reinforce++ [ 15] can lead to extremely large or small advantage values for\nsome samples. This can cause significant instability during training.\n3.Inconsistency Between Reasoning and Results. During training, we frequently observe inconsis-\ntencies between the model\u2019s reasoning process and its final output. The model may judge one answer\nas better during reasoning but ultimately output an opposite answer. This happens because rule-based\n2\n\nRL only scores the result without supervising the reasoning process, leading the model to learn to\ngenerate correct answers without coherent reasoning.\nTo this end, at the algorithm level, we propose StableReinforce, which introduces several key modifi-\ncations to traditional RL methods. Specifically, we refine the clipping operation to mitigate numerical\ninstability caused by large updates and introduce a robust advantage normalization technique that\nlimits the impact of outliers. On the reward function design front, StableReinforce introduces a novel\nmechanism: the use of an MLLM as a referee. This referee evaluates the consistency between the\nmodel\u2019s reasoning process and the final result, ensuring that the reasoning aligns with the output.\nThis consistency reward promotes more accurate and logically coherent decision-making.\nDuring the training phase, directly training the MLLM using reinforcement learning yields suboptimal\nresults. Therefore, a progressive difficulty training strategy is adopted. Initially, 200K preference data\nis collected from publicly available datasets, and GPT-4o generates corresponding thinking processes,\nreferred to as R1-Reward-200K, to serve as cold-start SFT data. Meanwhile, for each sample, the\nnumber of sampling attempts GPT-4o requires to infer a conclusion matching the ground truth is\nrecorded, which is considered the difficulty level of that sample. In the reinforcement learning phase,\nsamples where GPT-4o requires at least two sampling attempts to arrive at the correct answer, or\nfails to answer correctly even after three attempts, are selected as training data. These samples are\nthen used to train the model with the enhanced StableReinforce algorithm. As shown in Figure 2,\nthe reinforcement learning phase effectively performs token compression, and also resulting in a\nnoticeable performance improvement in our experiments.\nR1-Reward performs excellently on common multimodal reward modeling benchmarks. As shown in\nFigure 1, R1-Reward outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) on all the three benchmarks. Further-\nmore, R1-Reward exhibits strong inference time scalability. By sampling only five times and selecting\nthe most frequent answer as the correct one, the accuracy of reward modeling improves substantially.\nOn the MM-RLHF Reward Bench [ 66], VL Reward-Bench [ 21], and Multimodal Reward Bench [ 57],\nR1-Reward achieves improvements of 3.5%,13.5%, and 14.6%, respectively, compared to SOTA.\nAs the number of samples increases, performance continues to improve, demonstrating the potential\nof RL for multimodal reward modeling.\n2 Related Work\nMLLMs. Thanks to the success of language models, MLLMs have rapidly developed in recent\nyears, with their task handling capabilities and model performance advancing at a fast pace [ 14,\n68,59,20]. For example, traditional multi-modal large models perform well in handling complex\nhigh-resolution images and human dialogue [ 2,33,19,49,50]. A series of works focus on improving\nthe context length [ 45], computational efficiency [ 65,64], reducing hallucinations [ 29,67], enhancing\nconversational abilities [ 56], and aligning with human preferences [ 66]. Omni-MLLMs are capable\nof simultaneously processing multiple modalities such as speech, video, images [ 23,69], and even\ninteracting with users via voice [ 12,13]. Unify-MLLMs can perform mixed-modal generation [ 53,\n48,55], for example, generating an image with auxiliary lines while understanding a math problem,\nenhancing both generation and comprehension abilities. Recently, with the success of Open AI\u2019s\nO1 model and Deepseek\u2019s R1 model [ 9], the rule-based reinforcement learning approach has gained\nsignificant attention in the multi-modal field. Various studies are devoted to enhancing the reasoning\ncapabilities of multi-modal models. However, as far as we know, no work has yet explored whether\nthe reinforcement learning paradigm can be transferred into reward modeling.\nReward Model Training. The reward models most relevant to this paper are pure text reward\nmodels and multi-modal reward models. There are generally three main approaches to reward\nmodeling. The first approach is to directly use a language model or multi-modal model as the reward\nmodel by designing precise prompts that allow them to output a score or ranking [ 56]. However,\nthis method heavily depends on the model\u2019s instruction-following ability and comprehension. The\nsecond approach involves connecting the latent representation of a language model to a reward head\n(typically an MLP or linear layer), where the model directly outputs a score. During training, the\nreward modeling is converted into a binary classification task. This approach is computationally\nefficient, but it lacks interpretability [ 24,62,32,28,52]. The final type of model simultaneously\nlearns to evaluate the question-answer pair and creates an additional reward head to provide the\nscore [ 61,66]. This model strikes a balance between interpretability and computational efficiency,\nbut it usually requires specific data formats or training strategies. This paper proposes training a\n3\n\nreward model through reinforcement learning. The model first outputs an inference for a given\nquestion-answer pair and ultimately provides a ranking. Through reinforcement learning, we force\nthe model to learn the format of the reward modeling task, avoiding the shortcomings of the first\napproach without requiring an additional reward head, while maintaining the model\u2019s interpretability.\n3 Preliminary and Limitations\n3.1 Background and Limitations of Standard Reward Models\nReward models are a key component for aligning model outputs with human preferences. Typically,\na reward model starts with a pretrained LLM \u03d5, where the LLM head hlis replaced with a linear\nreward head lr, enabling the model to output a scalar reward value. These models are trained using\nhuman-provided pairwise comparisons. Given a query x, a preferred response ywand a less preferred\nresponse yl, the reward model is optimized to assign higher rewards to preferred responses:\n\u2113Reward (\u03b8) =Ex,yw,ylh\n\u2212log\u03c3\u0010\nr(yw|x)\u2212r(yl|x)\u0011i\n, (1)\nwhere r(y|x)is the scalar reward and \u03c3is the sigmoid function.\nDespite their utility, standard reward models face significant limitations. First, they fail to fully\nutilize the rich and detailed feedback provided by high-quality human annotations, such as textual\nexplanations and nuanced reasoning. Second, scalar rewards lack transparency, making it difficult for\nhumans to understand how the reward is generated. These challenges highlight the need for a more\ninterpretable and robust reward model that leverages critiques as intermediate reasoning steps.\n3.2 PPO and Reinforce++\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [40] is a commonly used algorithm in RL that aims to\noptimize a policy directly while maintaining stable and efficient learning. PPO belongs to the family\nof policy gradient methods, where the objective is to improve the policy by maximizing the expected\ncumulative reward. Unlike traditional policy gradient methods, which can suffer from large updates\nand instability, PPO introduces a novel way to constrain policy updates, ensuring both efficient and\nstable learning. The objective function for PPO is defined as:\nLPPO(\u03b8) =1\n|t|X\nt\u0014\nmin\u0012\u03c0\u03b8(at|st)\n\u03c0\u03b8old(at|st)At,clip\u0012\u03c0\u03b8(at|st)\n\u03c0\u03b8old(at|st),1\u2212\u03f5,1 +\u03f5\u0013\nAt\u0013\u0015\n-\u03c0\u03b8(at|st)is the probability of taking action atat state stunder the current policy \u03b8.\n-\u03c0\u03b8old(at|st)is the probability under the old policy with parameters \u03b8old.\n-Atis the advantage estimate at time t, which measures the relative desirability of the action taken.\n-\u03f5is a small hyperparameter (typically 0.1\u2264\u03f5\u22640.3) that controls how much the policy can change.\nThe first term in the minimum represents the standard objective, while the second term applies a\nclipping mechanism. The clip function restricts the ratio of the new policy to the old policy to stay\nwithin the interval [1\u2212\u03f5,1 +\u03f5]. If the ratio exceeds this range, the objective is capped, preventing\nlarge updates that could destabilize the learning process.\nPPO\u2019s key innovation is the introduction of a clipped objective function, which stabilizes the learning\nprocess by limiting the size of the policy updates. The method is both simple to implement and\ncomputationally efficient, making it a popular choice for a wide range of reinforcement learning\ntasks, including robotic control [46] and video game environments [41].\nReinforce++ [ 15] Enhancements. Reinforce++ incorporates several key optimizations to enhance\ntraining stability and efficiency of PPO. One is the addition of a token-level Kullback-Leibler (KL)\ndivergence penalty between the RL model and the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) model distributions.\nThis token-level KL penalty is introduced into the reward function as follows: r(st, at) =I(st=\n[EOS ])r(x, y)\u2212\u03b2KL(t)where xrepresents the input prompt, ydenotes the generated response,\nI(st= [EOS ])is an indicator function that checks if the token tis the final token in the sequence\n(End of Sequence), and \u03b2is the KL penalty coefficient, controlling the strength of the regularization.\n4\n\nAlgorithm 1 Pseudocode of PPO Loss Function in a PyTorch-like style.\n# log_probs: log probabilities of the current policy\n# old_log_probs: log probabilities of the previous policy\n# advantages: advantage estimates for the actions\n# epsilon: clipping parameter for PPO objective\n# Our Pre-Clip strategy: clip the log difference to prevent large values\nlog_diff = log_probs - old_log_probs\nlog_diff = torch.clamp(log_diff, max=np.log(1e3), min=np.log(1e-3)) # similar to 10\nratio = torch.exp(log_diff)\n# PPO strategy\n0. ratio = (log_probs - old_log_probs).exp() # compute the probability ratio\n1. surr1 = ratio * advantages # first surrogate objective\n2. surr2 = ratio.clamp(1 - epsilon, 1 + epsilon) * advantages # second surrogate with clipping\n# The final loss is the minimum of the two surrogates\n3. loss = -torch.min(surr1, surr2) # negative loss for minimization\nAdditionally, Reinforce++ introduces global batch-level reward normalization, clipping, and scaling\nfor stability, as well as advantage normalization: Anormalized =A\u2212\u00b5A\n\u03c3AWhere \u00b5Aand\u03c3Aare the\nmean and standard deviation of the advantage values. REINFORCE++ is shown to be more stable\ncompared to GRPO [43] and faster than PPO [54, 7].\n3.3 Drawbacks of Traditional PPO/Reinforce++\nDuring our training process, we observed two core issues in the Reinforce++ algorithms that can\neasily lead to model instability and poor performance, especially for reward model training.\nInstability Caused by Training Losses. The typical PPO loss function is implemented as fol-\nlows, given the log probabilities log\u03c0\u03b8(at|st),log\u03c0\u03b8old(at|st), and advantages. The pseudocode\nin for calculating the loss is shown in Algorithm 1 (lines 0-3). If the ratio\u03c0\u03b8(at|st)\n\u03c0\u03b8old(at|st)differs sig-\nnificantly, two main issues arise. First, the expression (log_probs \u2212old_log_probs ).exp() can\nlead to numerical instability. When the difference in token probabilities is large, the exponen-\ntial function may overflow, causing the model to crash. Even if the computation proceeds nor-\nmally, if the advantage is negative, \u2212torch.min (surr1,surr2)could result in an excessively large\nloss due to the minimization objective. For example: let log_probs = [\u22120.1,\u22120.1,\u22120.1,\u22120.1],\nold_log_probs = [\u221210,\u22120.2,\u22120.2,\u22125], and advantages = [\u22121.0,\u22121.0,0.5,\u22120.5], the resulting\nloss values might be: loss = [19930 .4,1.1,\u22120.5,67.1]. Such large losses can make the opti-\nmization process highly unstable. Currently, many training methods remove the KL divergence\nconstraint [ 31,35], allowing each mini-batch to perform multiple parameter updates, thereby improv-\ning data usage efficiency [ 15,40]. The former accelerates model updates, while the latter further\nincreases the discrepancy between log\u03c0\u03b8(at|st)andlog\u03c0\u03b8old(at|st). Consequently, in these cases,\nthe ratio between these two values can diverge significantly, leading to instability.\nInstability Caused by Advantage Normalization. In addition to the training loss, the data labels for\nthe reward model are relatively simple, consisting of only two labels: 1 and 2, which makes them\neasy to learn. As a result, during training, there is a high probability that the majority of the batch\nwill correctly predict the rewards. In extreme cases, such as a batch containing 255 rewards of 1 and\n1 reward of 0, this highly imbalanced distribution, when subjected to z-Normalization, can lead to\nsignificant numerical disparities. Particularly, the advantage corresponding to the 0 reward in this\nexample would be normalized to -15.96. A large advantage value like this can cause instability.\n4 R1-Reward\n4.1 Our Training Algorithm: StableReinforce\nTo overcome the drawbacks and enhance the stability of reinforcement learning training, we propose\ntwo strategies: pre-CLIP and advantage filter, which respectively remove unstable gradients and\nadvantages that deviate excessively from the overall distribution. In terms of reward design, we\nintroduce the consistency reward to ensure consistency between reasoning and the final answer.\n5\n\nPre-CLIP. As shown in Algorithm 1 under the \u201cOur Pre-Clip strategy\u201d, our core approach is to\nclip large ratios before computing the exponential of the log probability. The value of 1e3is a\nhyperparameter that we find works well and the method is relatively insensitive to hyperparameter\nvariations. The main purpose of this step is to mitigate the impact of noisy data on the overall training\nprocess with log-probability clamping:\n\u03c0\u03b8(at|st)\n\u03c0\u03b8old(at|st)\u2190exp\u0012\nclip\u0012\nlog\u03c0\u03b8\n\u03c0\u03b8old,log\u03b4min,log\u03b4max\u0013\u0013\nwhere \u03b4min= 10\u22123,\u03b4max= 103control allowable probability ratio bounds. By clipping the ratio\nbefore applying the exponential function, we can prevent overflow issues due to excessively large\ndifferences in the ratios. Additionally, this clipping ensures that large log-probability differences are\nmitigated, particularly when the advantage is negative, thus maintaining training stability.\nAdvantage Filter. To prevent the influence of outliers due to the extreme imbalance in the advantage\ndistribution, we apply the 3-sigma rule. For the standardized advantage, Astandardized =A\u2212\u00b5A\n\u03c3A, we\nretain only those advantages that fall within the range of [\u22123,3]1. This range corresponds to values\nwithin 3 standard deviations from the mean in the original distribution, as the standardization process\nconverts the data to z-scores (unitless measures in terms of standard deviations). In the extreme case\nfrom the previous subsection, this ensures that all samples with original rewards of 1 are selected,\nwhile extreme negative advantages are excluded.\n\u02c6A=\u001aAstandardized if|Astandardized | \u22643\n0 otherwise, A standardized =A\u2212\u00b5A\n\u03c3A+\u03f5\nThe final StableReinforce objective function with clipping applied:\nLStableReinforce(\u03b8) =1\n|t|X\nt\"\nmin \n\u03c0\u03b8(at|st)\n\u03c0\u03b8old(at|st)\u02c6At,clip \n\u03c0\u03b8(at|st)\n\u03c0\u03b8old(at|st),1\u2212\u03f5,1 +\u03f5!\n\u02c6At!#\n,\nwhere the reward calculation and advantage estimation strategies are the same to Reinforce++.\n4.2 Remark\nIn the field of RL for LLMs, recent concurrent advancements have emerged, some of which share\nsimilarities with our approach or report analogous observations. Although these methods have not\nbeen directly applied to multimodal domains or reward modeling, we provide a concise discussion\nin this section for comparative purposes. Notably, DAPO [ 58], TOPR [ 39], and Minimax-01 [ 18]\nfocus on improving CLIP operations, particularly in the design of the epsilon parameter. In contrast,\nour approach fundamentally differs by clipping the logits ratio prior to the exponential operation.\nThis strategy enhances numerical stability and mitigates the adverse effects of negative advantages.\nSimilarly, Dr. GRPO [ 25] identifies the detrimental impact of advantage normalization and adopts a\nstrategy of setting variance to 1. However, in scenarios with high original variance, this approach\nallows extreme values to dominate. Instead, we employ a 3-sigma filter, which preserves the benefits\nof z-normalization while effectively removing outliers.\n4.3 Reward Function and Training Data\nInspired by DeepSeek-R1 [ 9], we aim to directly use RL to guide the reward model in generating\nthe best analysis content, in order to produce high-quality model output comparisons. As a result,\nthe prompt format in Table 1 transforms the reward modeling task into a straightforward rule-based\nreinforcement learning problem. By defining the model\u2019s output format, we only need to define our\nreward functions to complete the training process:\n\u2022Formatting Reward. The model\u2019s output must adhere to a specific format of \u2018<think>\n</think><answer> </answer>\u2018, which encourages the model to reason before generating the\nfinal output. This ensures that the model reflects on the reasoning process before making its\nfinal decision, enhancing both the quality and interpretability of the generated content.\n1After applying Z-normalization in the original text, the distribution becomes a standard normal distribution,\nmeaning it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n6\n\nTable 1: Prompt template for reward model training.\nYou are a highly skilled and impartial evaluator tasked with comparing two responses generated by a\nLarge Multimodal Model for a given question.\n- Start with a thorough, side-by-side comparative analysis enclosed within <think> and</think>\ntags. A tie is not permitted; you must choose a better option.\n- Conclude with a single numeric choice enclosed within <answer> and</answer> tags:\n- Output \u201c1\u201d if Response 1 is better.\n- Output \u201c2\u201d if Response 2 is better.\nInput\n[Question]: {question}\n[Response 1]: {answer1}\n[Response 2]: {answer2}\nOutput Format (strictly follow)\n<think>Your detailed comparative analysis</think><answer>1/2</answer>\n\u2022Result Reward. The model\u2019s generated final result must align with human preferences.\nThis primarily involves ensuring that the model\u2019s output ranking labels are consistent with\nthose of human experts, enhancing the overall usefulness and credibility.\nInconsistency Between Reasoning and Results. However, simply following existing work [ 9,58]\nin our setting has led to unexpected results. During training, we observe discrepancies between\nthe model\u2019s reasoning and its final answer. For example, the reasoning might conclude that\nresponse 2 is better but the model outputs answer 1, as seen in <think>... response 2 is bet-\nter</think><answer>1</answer> . This inconsistency arises because, we provide no supervision\nfor the reasoning process and only score based on the outcome. When a sample demonstrates poor\nreasoning but produces the correct answer, this pattern is inadvertently reinforced, leading the model\nto believe that reasoning and the final answer are not necessarily linked. Consequently, the model may\nlearn to generate correct answers without a coherent reasoning process. This could even result in the\nmodel treating the reasoning process as irrelevant, or worse, outputting repetitive content or random\nnoise. To address this issue, we introduce an additional component, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, as\na supervisor to verify whether the reasoning and the final result are consistent. This addition helps\nensure that the reasoning process and output align well, introducing the following reward function:\n\u2022Consistency Reward. The model\u2019s final result must be consistent with its intermediate\nreasoning process. This function ensures that the final answer is directly derived from the\nmodel\u2019s reasoning process, rather than being generated in isolation from the reasoning steps.\nIntegrating the consistency reward as a separate reward and combining it with the previous two\nreward functions can lead to a situation where the model, despite selecting the wrong answer, may\nstill receive a high overall reward due to the consistency component. This could result in the model\noverly prioritizing consistency. To mitigate this issue, the final reward is designed as follows:\nFinal Reward =Result Reward \u00d7(1 + 0 .5\u00d7Consistency Reward ) + 0.5\u00d7Formatting Reward .\nThis ensures that the consistency reward is only taken into account when the result is correct, thereby\npreventing the model from excessively favoring consistency in cases where the outcome is incorrect.\nDataset Construction. As shown in Table 2, we sample preference data from multiple existing\ndatasets for training. To ensure data quality and diversity, we sample all instances from the human-\nannotated dataset MM-RLHF, and an additional 100,000 samples from other multimodal preference\ndatasets. The final dataset is termed R1-Reward-200k, which combines these diverse instances to\ncreate a robust training foundation for our model. We then randomly shuffle the data to ensure a\n7\n\nTable 2: Summary of datasets used for training , including the category (text or image), dataset\nname, the number of original samples, and the number of samples selected for final training.\nDataset # Original # Sample Dataset # Original # Sample\nRLAIF-V [60] 74,802\n100kMM-RLHF-Long [66] 41,163 41,163\nVL-Feedback [22] 80,258 MM-RLHF-Short [66] 46,281 46,281\nPOVID [70] 17,184 MM-RLHF-Mcq [66] 8,306 8,306\nWildVision-Battle [30] 10,383 MM-RLHF-Safety [66] 9,990 9,990\nbalanced ratio of answers 1 and 2 (1:1), preventing the model from favoring a specific answer. Each\nsample consists of a quadruple: (question, answer 1, answer 2, ground truth choice).\nLong-Cot Cold Start. Since MLLMs are not initially trained for reward modeling tasks, directly\nusing MLLMs for reinforcement learning training yields poor and unstable results. Therefore, we first\nuse GPT-4o as an annotator for each sample in the R1-Reward-200k dataset, utilizing the prompts\nfrom Table 1 to construct SFT data. The temperature is set to 0, with a maximum of 3 attempts. We\nalso record how many attempts GPT-4o needs to generate a final response that is judged to be correct\n(i.e., the same to the ground truth choice). This SFT training phase teaches the model the basic format\nand familiarizes it with the reward modeling task.\nRL Training Data. We use all samples from the SFT phase with at least 2 attempts, as well as\nsamples where GPT-4o fails to produce the correct answer after three attempts. These samples exhibit\nsmaller differences between answer 1 and answer 2, making them more difficult.\n5 Experiments\nImplementation Details. Both SFT and RL experiments are conducted on 4 \u00d7H800 (80G) GPUs.\nThe SFT phase trains for 1 epoch and takes approximately 8 hours, while the RL phase trains for\n5 epochs and takes 12 hours. We use QwenVL-2.5-7B-Instruct as the base model for training.\nDuring the SFT phase, the learning rate is set to 1e-5, and the batch size is set to 256. We use the\nOpenRLHF [ 16] framework for RL. The training batch size is set to 128, and the rollout batch size is\nset to 256. The learning rate is set to 1e-6, and the initial KL coefficient is set to 0.\nBaseline Algorithm. At the algorithmic level, we primarily compare two entities: the reward model\nand MM-RLHF-Reward [ 66]. For the former, we replace the language head of the base LLM with a\ntwo-layer MLP that outputs a float value as the reward. Training is done using a binary classification\nloss. For the latter, in addition to the traditional binary classification loss, an additional critic loss is\nrequired. Specifically, the model first outputs an evaluation of the candidate, and then, based on the\nevaluation, the reward head provides the reward value.\nBaseline Models. For multimodal reward models, we consider GPT-4o-mini (2024-07-18), Claude-\n3.5-Sonnet (2024-06-22), Gemini-1.5-Flash (2024-09-24), GPT-4o (2024-08-06), Gemini-1.5-Pro\n(2024-09-24), Gemini-2.0-Flash-Exp, SliME [ 63], VITA-1.5 [ 13], LLaV A-OneVision-7B-ov [ 19],\nQwen2-VL-7B [ 50], Molmo-7B [ 10], InternVL2/3-8B [ 5,71], LLaV A-Critic-8B [ 56], Llama-3.2-\n11B [ 32], Pixtral-12B [ 1], Molmo-72B [ 10], Qwen2-VL-72B [ 50], NVLM-D-72B [ 8], MM-RLHF-\nReward-7B [66], Llama-3.2-90B [32] and IXC-2.5-Reward [62] as comparison points.\nEvaluation Benchmarks and Metrics. The multimodal benchmark consists of the VL-Reward\nBench [ 21], Multimodal RewardBench [ 57] and the MM-RLHF-Reward Bench [ 66]. VL-Reward\nBench includes two evaluation metrics: Overall Accuracy and Macro Average Accuracy. Overall\nAccuracy measures the percentage of model decisions that align with human preferences, while\nMacro Average Accuracy calculates the mean accuracy across various task categories, addressing\ntask distribution imbalance. Multimodal RewardBench serves as a comprehensive benchmark for\nevaluating reward models. It covers six key areas: general correctness, preference, knowledge,\nreasoning, safety, and visual question answering (VQA). This benchmark includes 5,000 annotated\ntriplets, each consisting of a (multimodal prompt, chosen response, rejected response) pair. The\nMM-RLHF-Reward Bench also features two evaluation metrics: 1. Traditional Accuracy (Acc) : This\nmetric assesses the proportion of cases where the model correctly identifies the preferred response. 2.\nAcc+ : This measures the proportion of cases where the model correctly ranks all response pairs for a\ngiven sample. This metric emphasizes the model\u2019s ability to handle challenging cases, such as those\nwith small ranking differences or hard-to-distinguish pairs.\n8\n\nWhich group has the smallest summed value?\nTo determine which group has the smallest summed value, I'll add up the values for each\ngroup across all categories:\nwisdom: 3 + 5 + 8 + 3 + 4 + 3 = 26\nsake: 7 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 4 + 6 = 29\nsignal: 1 + 1 + 2 + 7 + 0 + 5 = 16\nThe group with the smallest summed value is \"signal\" with a total of 16.The \"text\" group has the smallest summed value.\n1. Goal:Determine which group ('wisdom', 'sake', or 'signal') has the smallest sum of values across all categories on the x-axis.\n2. Analyze Image:\nwisdom (blue): prayer=3, cry=5, point=8, horror=3, text=4, access=3.\nsake (teal): prayer=7, cry=1, point=4, horror=7, text=4, access=6.\nsignal (olive): prayer=1, cry=1, point=2, horror=7, text=3, access=5.\n3. Calculate Sums:\nwisdom: 3 + 5 + 8 + 3 + 4 + 3 = 26\nsake: 7 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 4 + 6 = 31\nsignal: 1 + 1 + 2 + 7 + 0 + 5 = 16 (Note: 0 for horror in the signal group means no data for that category, sum still calculates as 0+2+7+0+5 = 14, but the\ncalculation response gives 0 + 2 + 7 + 0 + 5 = 14, which implies summing the plotted values only, ignoring non-existent ones seems more relevant in a sum\ncontext. Let's use the plotted values as estimates: 1+1+2+7+3+5 = 19. checking image: 1+1+2+7+3+5 = 19. Looking again at the image, signal in horror is 0.\nRechecking Signal:\nData (as per legend): prayer=1, cry=1, point=2, horror=7, text=3, access=5.\nSum = 1 + 1 + 2 + 7 + 3 + 5 = 19.\nMy previous calculation (0+2+7+0+5 = 14) seems flawed. Let's recalculate using the scene image's data points.\nWisdom: 3+5+8+3+4+3 = 26. (Match)\nSake: 7+1+4+7+4+6 = 31. (Close, image might have minor variations)\nSignal: 1+1+2+7+3+5 = 19. (Match image perfectly)\nActual Calculations (image data):\nwisdom: 26 ; sake: 31 ;signal: 19\n4. Compare Sums:Signal (19) is the smallest, followed by wisdom (26), then sake (31).\n5. Evaluate Response 1:\nClaims \"text\" has the smallest sum.\n\"text\" is a category on the x-axis, not one of the \"wise[s], sa[k]e[s], or signal\" groups being compared by the legend.\nIncorrectly identifies a category label as a group label.\nRelies on flawed premise of the question itself.\n6. Evaluate Response 2:\nCorrectly identifies the relevant groups: \"wisdom\", \"sake\", \"signal\".\nAcknowledges the task is to sum values for each group across categories.\nAttempts to perform the summation based on the chart, listing values for each group and category. However, it makes several errors during this process:\nFor \"wisdom\": It lists carefully chosen values across the x-axis categories (3, 5, 8, 3, 4, 3). The sum it calculates is 26 (correct).\nFor \"sake\": Lists values 7, 1, 4, 7, 4, 6. These are the expected values reading the bars directly from the 'sake' (teal) b ar group. The calculated sum is 31\n(correct).\nFor \"signal\": Lists values 1, 1, 2, 7, 0, 5. The value 0 for 'signal' (olive) appears in the 'horror' category (as 0 for WiseSignalGroup and 7 for\nSakeSignalGroup, and 0 for SignalSignalGroup). However, the values 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 5 are plotted for that signal group across the x-axis categories. The sum 16\nis incorrect based on the plotted data (which is 1+1+2+7+3+5 = 19). The script seems to omit the plotted value 3 for the sign al group.\nDespite calculation errors for 'signal', the response correctly identifies \"wisdom\" and \"sake\" as having sums 26 and 31, respectively, and correctly compares\nthem to 'signal' (where the calculated sum was 16, which was actually 19 based on the plotted data).\nIdentifying \"signal\" as the group with the smallest sum is correct based on accurate calculation using the chart data (26 > 31 > 19).\n7. Conclusion:Response 2 demonstrates a much better understanding of the question and data visualization task, despite calculation errors i n its stepped\nbreakdown for one of the groups. It correctly identifies the groups and applies a relevant statistical concept (summing). Res ponse 1 fails to understand the\nquestion structure, misidentifying a category label as a group. Therefore, Response 2 is significantly better.\n</think><answer>2</answer>\nR1-Reward\nRe\ufffdlection patterns!Figure 3: An example of the R1-Reward output.

This represents a roughly 9.3% improvement in overall accuracy compared to\nthe previous best open-source model, IXC-2.5-Reward. Notably, IXC-2.5-Reward trains on more\nthan 1 million samples, while our training data consists of 200k samples, highlighting a significant\nimprovement in data efficiency. In comparison to other open-source models, R1-Reward demonstrates\na larger margin of improvement. Among closed-source models, Gemini-1.5-Pro performs the best,\nbut R1-Reward outperforms it across all dimensions, further demonstrating its superiority.\nOn the Multimodal Reward Bench (Table 4), R1-Reward achieves the best performance across all\ndimensions, with a 14.3%improvement over the previous state-of-the-art. It is worth noting that the\nMultimodal Reward Bench is derived from over ten existing benchmarks and reconstructed into a\nunified set, with minimal overlap with our training data. This further demonstrates R1-Reward\u2019s\nremarkable generalization ability across different datasets.\nThe MM-RLHF-Reward Bench (Table 5) presents a higher level of difficulty, particularly when\ndirectly utilizing language models as reward models. The best-performing model, Claude-3.7-Sonnet,\nachieves an accuracy of 65% on the Acc+ metric. Existing reward models perform well, with IXC-2.5-\nReward surpassing an Acc+ score of 50%, while the top reward model, MM-RLHF-Reward, exceeds\n60%. However, MM-RLHF-Reward is trained on a dataset that closely aligns with the distribution of\nthis benchmark, which limits its generalization ability. As a result, its performance on the VL Reward\nBenchmark is suboptimal. In contrast, R1-Reward demonstrates balanced performance across all\nbenchmarks. Moreover, when performing voting on five sampled results, its accuracy reaches 85.3%,\nand when sampling 15 times, it reaches 86.47%\u2014significantly outperforming existing models.\nTest-Time Scaling. In Figure 4, we explore whether increasing the number of samples can lead to\nimproved performance. It is important to note that the temperature is set to 1.0, which causes the\nresult with a single sample ( k= 1) to slightly differ from the main results (which use greedy decoding\nby default). As the number of samples increases, the model\u2019s performance improves consistently.\n\u201cV ote\u201d refers to a majority-voting strategy, while \u201cAny\u201d counts as correct if at least one of the sampled\nresults is correct.

In Table 6, we compare the performance of\na traditional reward model (using a two-layer MLP as the reward head) and MM-RLHF-Reward\n(which first generates a critic and then generates the reward) trained on the same dataset. For\nMM-RLHF-Reward, the training data must include an evaluation for each response. To achieve\nthis, we use GPT-4o to generate corresponding evaluations for each sample, which may be slightly\nless accurate than the human annotations used in the original work. All the models\u2019 backbones are\nQwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct. As shown in the table, the traditional reward model, when trained with only\n200K data samples, performs poorly. In most cases, MM-RLHF outperforms the traditional reward\nmodel. Its superior performance in the \u201challucination\u201d dimension is likely due to the generated critic.\nComparing these two baselines, the reinforcement learning-based approach significantly enhances\nthe reward modeling capabilities, even with the same amount of data. Moreover, our SFT approach\nshows advantages over both the traditional reward model and MM-RLHF-Reward. We believe this\nis primarily due to that we allow direct comparison of two responses during the scoring process,\nwhereas existing methods score responses independently before comparing them.\nAblation Studies of the StableReinforce Algorithm. We examine the impact of each component\nof the StableReinforce algorithm on the training process and final results. First, we emphasize\nthe necessity of the Consistency Reward Function. Removing this function results in significant\nhallucination behaviors across different algorithms, making it challenging to achieve stable evaluation\noutcomes. Additionally, directly applying the Reinforce++ algorithm causes the model to crash,\nwith the loss becoming NaN and the response length reaching the preset maximum length, while the\noutput consists entirely of garbled text. In Table 6 and Figure 5, we present the effects of removing\neach module on final performance and changes in training dynamics. We observe that the Advantage\nFilter and Pre-Clip modules primarily ensure training stability by effectively removing outliers from\nthe loss. Removing any of these components results in decreased final accuracy, reduced training\nstability, and the model\u2019s output length failing to converge to shorter values.\nAha Moment of R1-Reward. Through our task design and reward function formulation, the R1-\nReward model effectively learns the reward modeling task structure during the SFT phase. Following\nreinforcement learning, it reduces the length of reasoning to enhance efficiency. Visual examples of\nthe model\u2019s output appear in Figures 3 and 6. The model autonomously learns a process to assess\nresponse quality. It first defines the goal, analyzes the image, attempts to solve the problem, and\nprovides an answer.

We\ndemonstrate that RL can be effectively applied to reward modeling, significantly enhancing its\nperformance. Our approach addresses key challenges, including training instability, the advantage\nnormalization limitation, and inconsistencies between reasoning and results. By incorporating\ntechniques such as pre-clipping, advantage filtering, consistency reward and a a progressive difficulty\ntraining strategy, StableReinforce stabilizes training and improves model performance. Experiments\nshow that R1-Reward outperforms SOTA models on several multimodal reward model benchmarks,\nwith significant improvements in accuracy and data efficiency.\nFurthermore, R1-Reward demonstrates excellent test-time scaling capabilities, and paves the way\nfor future research on integrating reinforcement learning into MRMs. Looking ahead, there are still\nmany areas to explore in RL for reward modeling. For example, we only test a simple majority voting\nstrategy for test-time scaling; more advanced methods could potentially improve performance fur-\nther [ 26]. Additionally, improving training strategies to further enhance the foundational capabilities\nof reward models is also a meaningful open problem.\nReferences\n[1]Pravesh Agrawal, Szymon Antoniak, Emma Bou Hanna, Baptiste Bout, Devendra Chaplot,\nJessica Chudnovsky, Diogo Costa, Baudouin De Monicault, Saurabh Garg, Theophile Gervet,\net al.

Reinforce++: A simple and efficient approach for aligning large language models.\narXiv , 2025.\n14\n\nThe members of the science club shared how many times they had been to\nthe zoo last year. How many members went to the zoo fewer than 2 times?\nTo answer this question, let's analyze the data provided in the image: 1. The table shows \"Trips to the zoo last year\" 2. It has two\ncolumns: \"Number of trips\" and \"Frequency\"\nWe need to find how many members went to the zoo fewer than 2 times. This includes those who went 0 times and 1 time.\nFrom the table: - 14 members went 0 times - 5 members went 1 time\nTo get the total number of members who went fewer than 2 times, we add these two numbers: 14 + 5 = 19\nTherefore, 19 members of the science club went to the zoo fewer than 2 times last year.To find out how many members went to the zoo fewer than 2 times, add the\nfrequencies for 0 trips and 1 trip: -\n0 trips: 14 members \u2013\n1 trip: 5 members\nTotal = 14 + 5 = 19 members So, 19 members went to the zoo fewer than 2 times.\n1. Analyze the Request: The user wants me to evaluate two responses answering a question based on a provided image (a frequen cy table showing trips to the\nzoo). The question asks for the number of members who went to the zoo fewer than 2 times. I need to compare the responses, explain my reasoning, and\nchoose the better one, avoiding a tie.\n2. Analyze the Image Data:\nThe table represents \"Trips to the zoo last year\".\nColumn 1: \"Number of trips\" (X) Column 2: \"Frequency\" (F)\nRow 1: (X=0, F=14) -> 0 trips, 14 members Row 2: (X=1, F=5) -> 1 trip, 5 members\nRow 3: (X=2, F=4) -> 2 trips, 4 members Row 4: (X=3, F=8) -> 3 trips, 8 members\n3. Evaluate the Question:\n\"How many members went to the zoo fewer than 2 times?\"\n\"Fewer than 2\" means strictly less than 2. This corresponds to only the number of trips X = 0.\nThe frequency for X = 0 is 14.\nWait, re-reading the question. It says \"The members of the science club shared how many times they had been to the zoo last year.\" The question doesn't\naskhow manymembers wentexactly0 times, but rather how many went *fewer than* 2 times.\nAnotherpossibility is to sum the frequencies for 0 and 1 trips: 14 (for 0 trips) + 5 (for 1 trip). This represents 14 + 5 = 19 members who went 0 OR 1 time.\nThis seems more likely what the question intends.\n4. Analyze Response 1:\nInterpretation:Response 1 interprets \"fewer than 2 times\" as including both 0 trips and 1 trip.\nMethod:Sums the frequencies for 0 trips (14) and 1 trip (5).\nCalculation:14 + 5 = 19.\nConclusion:19 members.\nClarity:Clear and concise. Uses bolded text for key numbers.\nAccuracy:This interpretation is common and generally reflects a cleaner reading of \"fewer than 2 times\" in this context.\n5. Analyze Response 2:\nInterpretation:Response 2 also interprets \"fewer than 2 times\" as including 0 trips and 1 trip.\nMethod:Explicitly states the need to find members who went 0 times or 1 time. Sum the frequencies for 0 trips (14) and 1 trip (5).\nCalculation:14 + 5 = 19.\nConclusion:19 members.\nClarity:Very clear, structured step-by-step. Explainswhyit's looking for 0 and 1 trips. Includes references to the table structure.\nAccuracy:Same as Response 1.\n6. Compare Responses:\nAccuracy:Both responses arrive at the likely intended answer (19) and use the correct calculation based on that interpretation. Both * mis*quote the\nquestion slightly by calling itexactlyrather thanfewer than, but this is a minor point as they correctly interpret the data for *fewer than*.\nInterpretation of \"Fewer Than\":Both interpret \"fewer than 2 times\" as the range 0 to 1, meaning either 0 trips OR 1 trip. This is the most plausible\ninterpretation in this scenario.\nClarity & Explanation:Response 1 is very concise. Response 2 is much more detailed, explaining its steps and explicitly stating the logic (finding 0 and 1\ntrip frequencies) and context (table structure).\nHelpfulness:Response 2's structured approach and explanation might be slightly more helpful to a user trying to understandhowto use the table andwhy0\nand 1 trips are relevant. Response 1 is sufficient for getting the answer but less explanatory.\nOverall:Both are good responses. Response 2's step-by-step structure and explicit reasoning, while slightly longer, offer a slightly better explanation of the\nprocess used to arrive at the answer, making it marginally better in terms of demonstrating the understanding of the data and question. The explicit reference to\nthe table columns and the final sentence confirming what the number represents adds value.\n7. Conclusion: Response 2 is slightly better due to its more detailed explanation and step-by-step reasoning, making the process clearer.\n</think> <answer>2</answer>\nR1-Reward\nRe\ufffdlection patterns!\nFigure 6: An example of the R1-Reward output.\n15\n\n[16] Jian Hu, Xibin Wu, Zilin Zhu, Xianyu, Weixun Wang, Dehao Zhang, and Yu Cao.

Investigation of DiT is provided in Appendix A,\nwhich leads to the similar results as SiT.\n1 Introduction\nDiffusion transformers [57, 52, 10] and vision transformers [18, 49, 68] have held the dominant\npositions in visual generation and representation because of their scalability during pre-training [5,\n20, 56, 65] and generalization capacity for downstream tasks [38, 47, 35, 45].\nRecently, many works [77, 79, 74, 39] have explored leveraging representation components of vi-\nsion transformers for diffusion transformer\u2019s training, and have shown that learning a high-quality\ninternal representation can not only speed-up the generative training progress, but also improve\nthe generation quality. These works either utilize the training paradigm in representation learning\n(e.g., MAE\u2019s [26], IBOT\u2019s [78]) shown in Figure 1a or leverage a large-scale pre-trained represen-\ntation foundation model ( e.g., DINOv2 [56], CLIP [60]) shown in Figure 1b to give representation\nguidance for the diffusion transformer during the original generative training. However, the former\nmethod requires a complex training framework design, and the latter method relies on a powerful\nprior which is trained on massive amount of data with thousands of GPUs. Thus, we raise a sig-\nnificant but underexplored question: Can we obtain such representation guidance only during the\ngenerative training without any representation component involved?\nOur observations: Different from the representation model that takes a clean image as input then\noutput semantically-rich feature, diffusion model often takes a noise latent as input and obtain\ncleaner one step-by-step. In other words, the generative mechanism by which the diffusion model\noperates can be generally considered as a coarse to fine process. Hence, we hypothesise that the\nrepresentations in diffusion models also follow this trend. To testify this, we perform an empirical\nanalysis with recent diffusion transformers [52, 57]. As shown in Figure 2a, we first find out that the\nlatent features in the diffusion transformer are progressively refined, moving from coarse to fine, as\nblock layers increase and noise level decreased. Next, akin to the results in prior studies [74, 70], we\nobserve that the diffusion transformer already learns meaningful discriminative representations as\nshown in Figure 2b. Meanwhile, although the accuracy drop off after reach a peak at about layer 20\nbecause the model needs to shift away to focus on generating images with high-frequency details,\nthe quality of the representations basically transfer from bad to good by increasing block layers and\ndecreasing noise level. These results indicate that the diffusion transformer gets a roughly from\ncoarse-to-fine discriminative process when only generative training is performed.\nThis distinctive trend motivates us to leverage the better representations in the diffusion transformer\nto guide the weaker ones in the original generative training, thereby enhancing the representation\nlearning of the model without involving any additional representation component. However, this\napproach is not straightforward during training. As observed in previous studies [11, 25], directly\nusing the output of the same model as a supervision signal may lead to shortcut learning [23], which\ncan compromise performance or even cause training collapse.\n2\n\nOur approach: To overcome abovementioned hurdles, we present Self-Representation Alignment\n(SRA), a simple but effective technique built on recent diffusion transformer architectures [52, 57].\nAs shown in Figure 1c, SRA dose not need any representation component, in essence, it aligns\nthe output latent representations in earlier layer conditioned with higher noise to that in later layer\nconditioned with lower noise to achieve self-representation guidance. Meanwhile, in order to make\nthe training process more stable, we obtain the target features from another model which shares the\nsame architecture with the trainable model but updates weight by weighted moving average (EMA)1.\nFurthermore, the student\u2019s output latent feature is first passed through the projection layers to con-\nduct a slight nonlinear transformation for better representation extraction, and then aligned with the\ntarget feature output by the teacher. In a nutshell, our SRA can offer a flexible way to integrate\nrepresentation guidance without representation component needs and architect modification.\nBased on our analysis, we conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of SRA.\nAfter a series of component-wise analyses within the design space, we show that SRA brings sig-\nnificant performance improvements to both DiTs [57] and SiTs [52]. Moreover, our ablation study\nhighlights the crucial role of internal representations in the success of SRA, which supports our\ncentral hypothesis: diffusion transformers can provide representation guidance by themselves .\nIn summary, our main contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 We analyze the latent representations in the diffusion transformers and assume that diffusion trans-\nformers have the potential to provide representation guidance by themselves.\n\u2022 We introduce SRA, a simple yet effective method that aligns the output latent representations of\nthe diffusion transformers in earlier layer with higher noise to that in later layer with lower noise\nto achieve self-representation guidance.\n\u2022 With our SRA, both DiTs and SiTs achieve sustained training speed acceleration and nontrivial\ngeneration performance improvement.\n2 Method\n2.1 Preliminary: Training Object of DiT and SiT\nAs our method is built upon the diffusion-based model (DiT) and flow-based model (SiT), to facil-\nitate a more seamless introduction of SRA in the subsequent part, we now present a brief overview\nof the training object of these two types of models. We omit the class-condition here for simplicity\nbecause it can be easily added to all analogs without causing any changes to the mathematical equa-\ntions. We leave more detailed mathematical descriptions of these types of models in Appendix B.\nDiffusion-based models learn to transform Gaussian noise into data samples through a step-by-step\ndenoising process. Given a pre-defined forward process that gradually adds noise, these models\nlearn the reverse process to recover the original data.\nFor data point x0from distribution p(x), the forward noising process follows: q(xt|xt\u22121) =\nN(xt;\u221a1\u2212\u03b2tx0, \u03b22\ntI). The model learns to reverse this process using a neural network \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t)\nthat predicts the noise added at each step. The network is trained using a simple mean squared error\nobjective that measures how well it can predict the noise:\nLsimple =Ex\u2217,\u03f5, th\n||\u03f5\u2212\u03f5\u03b8(xt, t)||2\n2i\n. (1)\nDifferent from diffusion-based model, flow-based model aims to learn a velocity field v\u03b8(xt, t)that\ngoverns a probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF ODE). This PF ODE allows the model\nto sample data by starting from Gaussian noise and flowing towards the data distribution. This\nprocess is defined as:\nxt=\u03b1tx\u2217+\u03c3t\u03f5, \u03b1 0=\u03c3T= 1, \u03b1T=\u03c30= 0, (2)\nwhere x\u2217\u223cp(x)is the data, \u03f5\u223c N (0,I)is Gaussian noise, and \u03b1tand\u03c3tare decreasing and\nincreasing functions of t\u2208[0, T], respectively. The PF ODE is given by:\n\u02d9xt=v(xt, t), (3)\n1In the following part, we use term \u2018student\u2019 to represent the trainable model and \u2018teacher\u2019 to represent the\nEMA model in SRA for simplicity.\n3\n\nwhere the distribution of this ODE at time tmatches the marginal distribution pt(x).\nThe velocity field can be expressed as:\nv(x, t) =E[\u02d9xt|xt=x] = \u02d9\u03b1tE[x\u2217|xt=x] + \u02d9\u03c3tE[\u03f5|xt=x]. (4)\nTo learn the velocity field, the model v\u03b8(xt, t)is trained to minimize the following loss function:\nLvelocity =Ex\u2217,\u03f5,t\u0002\n||v\u03b8(xt, t)\u2212\u02d9\u03b1tx\u2217\u2212\u02d9\u03c3t\u03f5||2\u0003\n. (5)\nFor the sake of simplicity, in the following part, we use generative loss ( Lgen) to uniformly represent\nthe two generative training objects of DiT and SiT.\n2.2 Self-Representation Alignment\nDiT/SiT Block\nDiT/SiT BlockDiT/SiT Block\nDiT/SiT Block\nDiT/SiT Block\nDiT/SiT Block\n\u2505DiT/SiT Block\nDiT/SiT BlockDiT/SiT Block\nDiT/SiT Block\nDiT/SiT Block\nDiT/SiT Block\n\u2505\nMLPsEarlier Layer\nHigher Noise  Later Layer\nLower Noise\ud835sa\n\ud835gen\nEMA\nFigure 3: Overall framework of SRA. Our SRA explicitly\naligns the diffusion transformer\u2019s representations in earlier\nlayer with higher noise with the representations in later layer\nwith lower noise to conduct self-representation alignment.Previous studies have demonstrated\nthat learning good internal represen-\ntation can both speed up diffusion\ntransformer\u2019s training and improve\nthe quality of its generated samples.\nIn SRA, our insight is aligning stu-\ndents latent feature in earlier layer\nconditioned on higher noise with that\nin later layer conditioned on lower\nnoise of teacher to conduct self-\nrepresentation guidance without re-\nquiring any dedicated representation\ncomponents. As depicted in Figure 3,\nthe goal of this simple training frame-\nwork is let the diffusion transformer\nnot only predict noise-invariant, but\nalso align with better visual represen-\ntations from itself. This thereby pro-\nvides a simple and resource-friendly way to enhance the representation learning in the diffusion\ntransformer during generative training without the need to design complex representation regulation\nor introduce additional representation foundation models.\nFormally, let fbe the trainable student model and f\u2217be the teacher model. Considering input noise\nlatent, timestep, and condition to be xt,t, and c. Then, we can obtain the student encoder latent\noutput y=fm(xt, t, c)\u2208RB\u00d7N\u00d7D, where B, N, D > 0are the batchsize, number of patches\nand the embedding dimension for f, and mdenotes the output from the mthlayer in f. Similarly,\nthe output of the teacher can be expressed as y\u2217=fn\n\u2217(xt\u2212k, t\u2212k, c)\u2208RB\u00d7N\u00d7D. In our SRA,\nwe set m\u2264n,k\u22650, and 0\u2264(t\u2212k)< tmax2. Hence, we can conduct self-representation\nalignment using the teacher\u2019s output y\u2217and the student\u2019s output variant h\u03d5(y)\u2208RB\u00d7N\u00d7D, where\nh\u03d5(y)is a projection of the student encoder output ythat through a lightweight trainable MLPs head\nh\u03d5. Notably, this projection head can be discarded optionally after training, which enables SRA to\nprovide guidance without altering any architecture in diffusion transformers.\nIn particular, SRA attains self-alignment by minimizing the patch-wise distance between the\nteacher\u2019s output ( y\u2217) and the student\u2019s output variant ( h\u03d5(y)):\nLsa(\u03b8s, \u03d5) =Ext,t,ch1\nNNX\ni=1dist(y[i]\n\u2217, h\u03d5(y[i]))i\n, (6)\nwhere [i]is a patch index, dist(\u00b7,\u00b7)is a pre-defined distance calculation function, and \u03b8s,\u03d5is the\nparameters of student diffusion transformer and the projection head.\nFinally, we add this objective in the original diffusion-based objective described in Section 2.1 and\nAppendix B for joint learning:\nL=Lgen+\u03bbLsa, (7)\n2For SiTs, tmax = 1and for DiTs, tmax = 1000 . In practice, we truncate ( t\u2212k) to 0 if it is less than 0.\n4\n\nwhere \u03bb > 0is a hyperparameter that controls the trade-off between generation object and self-\nrepresentation alignment object.\n2.3 EMA Teacher Network\nIn SRA, we do not need a off-the-shelf teacher to give the prior guidance. Meanwhile, using the\noutput of the same model as the target to conduct supervision would cause training instability [11,\n25]. Thus, we follow some works in self-supervised learning (SSL) [78, 8, 27] that build the teacher\nfrom past iterations of the student network using an exponential moving average (EMA) on the\nstudent weights. In specific, the update role of EMA is \u03b8t=\u03b1\u03b8t+ (1\u2212\u03b1)\u03b8s, where \u03b1\u2208[0,1)is\nthe momentum coefficient. We study different values of \u03b1in Section 3.2 and show that \u03b1= 0.9999\nunchanged works surprisingly well in our framework. Moreover, we do not use other operations like\nclustering constraints [6, 7], batch normalizations [25, 61], and centering [8, 78] in SSL, because we\nfind that the training progress is already stable enough without applying these tricks.\n3 Experiment\nIn this section, we seek to validate the effect of SRA through extensive experiments. In a specific,\nwe mainly focus on answering the following questions:\n\u2022 How each design choice and component in SRA influence the performance? (Table 1)\n\u2022 Dose SRA work on different baselines across different model size? (Figure 4)\n\u2022 Can SRA show comparable or superior performance against other methods that leverage either\nrepresentation training paradigm or representation foundation model? (Table 2)\n\u2022 Does SRA genuinely enhance the representation capacity of the baseline model, and is the gener-\nation capability indeed strongly correlated with the representation guidance? (Figure 6)\n3.1 Experimental Setup\nImplementation details. Unless otherwise specified, the training details are strictly followed the\nsetup in DiT [57] and SiT [52], including AdamW [51] with a constant learning rate of 1e-4, no\nweight decay, batchsize of 256, using the Stable Diffusion V AE [62] to extract the latent, and etc.\nWe use ImageNet [16], where each image is preprocessed to the resolution of 256 \u00d7256 (denoted\nas ImageNet 256 \u00d7256), and follow ADM [17] for other data preprocessing protocols. For model\nconfigurations, we use the B/2, L/2, and XL/2 architectures introduced in the DiT and SiT papers,\nwhich process inputs with a patch size of 2. Additional experimental details, hyperparameter set-\ntings, linear probing details, and computing resources, are provided in Appendix C.\nEvaluation. We report Fr \u00b4echet inception distance (FID [28]), sFID [54], inception score (IS [64]),\nprecision (Pre.) and recall (Rec.) [41] . To ensure a fair comparison with previous methods, we also\nuse the ADMs TensorFlow evaluation suite [17]with 50K samples and the same reference statistics.\nMore details of each metric are provided in Appendix D.\nSampler. For DiT [57], we use DDPM sampler and set the number of function evaluations (NFE)\nas 250 by default. For SiT [52], we use the SDE Euler-Maruyama sampler (for SDE with wt=\u03c3t)\nand set the NEF as 250 by default. The settings also align with those used in DiT and SiT papers.\nBaselines. We use several recent diffusion-based generation methods as baselines. Specifically, we\nconsider the following three types of approaches: (a) Pixel diffusion : ADM [17], VDM ++ [37],\nSimple diffusion [32], CDM [30], (b) Latent diffusion with U-Net : LDM [63], and (c) Latent diffu-\nsion with transformers : DiT [57], SiT [52], SD-DiT [79], MaskDiT [77], TREAD [39], REPA [74],\nand MAETok [9]. Here in diffusion transformers family, we choose to compare with DiT/SiT and\ntheir modifications with representation components involved but do not compare with works aiming\nat designing advanced architecture like lightningDiT [73] and DDT [67]. Detailed descriptions of\neach baseline method are provided in Appendix E.\n3.2 Component-Wise Analysis\nBelow, we provide a detailed analysis of the impact of each component. To save time, we use\nSiT-B/2 and train with SRA for 400K iterations for evaluation.

We begin by analyzing the effect of using different blocks of student\nand teacher for alignment. We observe that using the teacher\u2019s last but not least few layers ( e.g., 8) to\nregulate the student\u2019s first layers ( e.g., 3) leads to optimal performance. We assume that the first few\nlayers need more guidance so they can catch semantically meaningful representation for subsequent\ngeneration. Meanwhile, there is a strong correlation between the quality of the representations of the\nteacher\u2019s layers and the performance of the corresponding aligned student (we give the quantitative\nresults and analysis in latter Section 3.4). Based on these results, we set alignment layers as 3\u2212 \u21928,\n6\u2212 \u219216, and 8\u2212 \u219220for B, L, and XL models respectively as default3\nTime intervalforalign ment. We then study the time interval (meaning the same as kin Section 2.2)\nused for alignment. Here we study fixed and dynamic interval. Notably, we find that using teacher\u2019s\nfeatures input with lower noise than student\u2019s leads to performance enhancement and interval value\nwith 0.1 or the mean with 0.1 is optimal. We hypothesize that this is because lower noise levels can\noffer better representation guidance; but an excessively large time interval can hinder the model\u2019s\nlearning process, causing it to only focus on optimizing alignment loss at the expense of neglect-\ning the generative aspects. As dynamic interval shows slightly better performance, we apply time\ninterval as 0\u223c0.2in our feature experiments4.\nObjectiveforalign ment. We next compare three simple regression training objectives for align-\nment, including smooth- \u21131,\u21131, and\u21132. Empirically, we find that all three objectives can lead to good\nperformance and are stable during training. We adopt smooth- \u21131by default in future experiments.\nTeacher network foralign ment. In other generative learning studies, the EMA model is often\nemployed solely for evaluation. However, as we need it to provide guidance during training, we\nstudy different updating methods here. Here, we investigate several different strategies to build the\nteacher. First, we find that using teacher copied from student would impair the performance, which\n3For DiTs, we set alignment layers as 3\u2212 \u21927,6\u2212 \u219214, and 8\u2212 \u219216by default because DiT\u2019s discriminative\nbehavior across layers is sightly different from SiT\u2019s (see Figure 2 and Figure 7).\n4For DiTs, we set time interval as \u230a0\u223c200\u230bby default since DiTs adopt the linear variance schedule with\ntwhere t\u2208 {0,1,2, ..., 999} \u2229Z.\n6\n\ntestifies our argument in Section 1. Next, we consider using strategy used in self-supervised learning\nworks [8, 78, 25] that updates momentum coefficient from 0.996 to 1 during training. However, in\nour framework, this does not work well. Finally, we use momentum coefficient of 0.9999 unchanged\nwhich is commonly used in other generative learning works [17, 57, 52] and find it is also suitable\nfor our framework. Thus, we set momentum coefficient as 0.9999 in future experiments.\nEffectofprojection head foralign ment. We finally examine the effect of the projection head for\nalignment. Surprisingly, We observe that using this simple head to post-possess the student\u2019s output\nis much better than directly using it to alignment. We hypothesize this slight operation enables\nthe model to learn more effective hidden representations for subsequent projection head to conduct\ntransformation for final alignment, rather than explicitly aligning the entire latent feature that could\npotentially disrupt the original generation field that each layer and timestep is responsible for [76,\n75, 22]. Hence, we keep using the projection head in future experiments.\n3.3 System-Level Comparison\nBased on the analysis, we perform a system-level comparison between recent state-of-the-art diffu-\nsion model approaches and diffusion transformers with SRA.\nFirst, we compare the FID values between vanilla DiT or SiT and the same models trained with\nSRA. As shown in Figure. 4, diffusion transformers trained with SRA demonstrate substantial im-\nprovements in performance at each training step across different types , as well as various sizes.\nMoreover, similar to the observation in some SSL works [56, 21], we notice that the effect of SRA\nin larger size model is more significant, which probably because larger model tends to provide richer\nguidance. It is also worth noting that the benefits of SRA do not saturate even when the models have\nalready achieved a low FID score. We assume that this is likely due to the teacher\u2019s constantly\nimproving capacity throughout training, which allows it to provide better and better representation\nguidance for the student when the training goes on.\nFigure 4: FID comparisons with vanilla DiTs and SiTs across different model size on ImageNet\n256\u00d7256 without classifier-free guidance (CFG).\nFinally, we provide a quantitative comparison between SiT-XL with SRA and other recent dif- fu-\nsion model methods using classifier-free guidance [31]. Our method already outperforms the orig-\ninal SiT-XL model with 1000 fewer epochs and it is further improved with longer training. At 800\nepochs, SiT-XL with SRA achieves FID of 1.58 and IS of 311.4. It is worth noting that this result\nis far superior than methods ( e.g., MaskDiT [77]) that rely on auxiliary and complex representa-\ntion training frameworks, and is comparable with methods ( e.g., REPA [74]) that depend heavily\n7\n\nTable 2: System-level comparison on ImageNet 256 \u00d7256 with Classifier-free Guidance (CFG).\nThebest and second-best results on each metric are highlighted in bold and underlined.\nModel Epochs Tokenizer FID \u2193sFID\u2193 IS\u2191 Pre.\u2191Rec.\u2191\nPixel diffusion\nADM-U 400 - 3.94 6.14 186.7 0.82 0.52\nVDM ++ 560 - 2.40 - 225.3 - -\nSimple diffusion 800 - 2.77 - 211.8 - -\nCDM 2160 - 4.88 - 158.7 - -\nLatent diffusion, U-Net\nLDM-4 200 LDM-V AE 3.60 - 247.7 0.87 0.48\nLatent diffusion, Transformer\nDiT-XL/2 1400 SD-V AE 2.27 4.60 278.2 0.83 0.57\nSiT-XL/2 1400 SD-V AE 2.06 4.50 270.3 0.82 0.59\nSD-DiT 480 SD-V AE 3.23 - - - -\nMaskDiT 1600 SD-V AE 2.28 5.67 276.6 0.80 0.61\nDiT + TREAD 740 SD-V AE 1.69 4.73 292.7 0.81 0.63\nSiT + REPA 800 SD-V AE 1.42 4.70 305.7 0.80 0.65\nSiT + MAETok 800 MAE-Tok 1.67 - 311.2 - -\nSiT + SRA (ours) 400 SD-V AE 1.85 4.50 297.2 0.82 0.61\nSiT + SRA (ours) 800 SD-V AE 1.58 4.65 311.4 0.80 0.63\nFigure 5: Selected samples on ImageNet 256 \u00d7256 from the SiT-XL + SRA.

Moreover, due to the progressively higher-quality guid-\nance teacher provide throughout training, we find that our method is much less likely to encounter\nsaturation compared with REPA (we provide detailed results and analysis in Appendix F).\n3.4 Ablation Study\nIn this part, we aim at testing whether representation truly matters in SRA. We give the answer by\nconducting following experiments.\nEnhanced representation capacity with SRA. We first compare the representation capacity of\nvanilla SiT and SiT trained with SRA. As shown in Figure 6a and Figure 6b, SRA consistently\nimprove the quality of latent representation in the diffusion transformer, as indicated by better linear\nprobing results across different blocks and timesteps.\nTight coupling between generation quality and representation guidance in SRA. We then in-\nvestigate the correlation between generation performance and the representation guidance (detailed\nexperimental setup can be find in Appendix G) in SRA. Figure 6c reveals a strong correlation be-\ntween linear probing accuracy and FID scores as the teacher network layers for alignment are varied.\n8\n\n                     (a) Linear Probing Result (t=0.1)                      (b) Linear Probing Result of Layer 8                                 (c) Validation Acc. vs. FID\n              \n Figure 6: We empirically investigate the effect of representations in SRA. Left and Middle: Linear\nprobing result of vanilla SiT-XL trained for 1400 epochs and SiT-XL + SRA trained for 800 epochs.\nRight: Linear probing vs. FID plot of SiT-XL + SRA with different teacher\u2019s output layers for\nalignment (similar plot of DiT + SRA is provided in Appendix H).\nThis finding underscores that the model\u2019s generative capabilities are indeed closely tied to the effec-\ntiveness of the self-representation guidance mechanism.\n4 Related Work\nWe discuss with the most relevant studies here and provide a more discussion in Appendix I.\nRepresentations guidance for diffusion transformer\u2019s pre-training. Many recent works have\nattempted to introducing representation guidance in diffusion transformer\u2019s training. MaskDiT [77]\nand SD-DiT [79] add MAE\u2019s [26] and IBOT\u2019s [78] training paradigm into the original DiT\u2019s training\nprogress. TREAD [39] design a token routing strategy with MAE loss to speed-up diffusion model\u2019s\ntraining. REPA [74] utilize a large-scale data pre-trained representation model to regulate diffusion\nmodel\u2019s latent feature. V A-V AE [73] and MAETok [9] align the latent distribution of the tokenizer\nwith additional representation foundation model and show this alignment is beneficial to resulting\ndiffusion models. Different from these work, we aim at looking for representation guidance in the\ndiffusion model itself and it\u2019s own training paradigm.\nEMA model as teacher guidance. Different from traditional knowledge distillation [24] that uses\na stronger pre-trained model as teacher, using EMA model [33] as teacher can be seen as self-\ndistillation because the weight of the teacher model is obtained by weighted moving average of the\nparameters of the student model. This method needs a feasible pretext task to succeed. For example,\nMoCo [27, 13] sets the EMA teacher as momentum encoder and use contrastive learning to guidance\nthe student model; DINO [8, 56] feeds two views of images to EMA teacher and trainable student\nthen forces the student\u2019s output distribution to be close to teacher\u2019s. Our work also shares some\nsimilarities, where we set aligning student model\u2019s latent feature in earlier layer and higher noise\nwith that in later layer and lower noise of the EMA teacher as our pretext task for training.\n5 Conclusion and Discussion\nIn this study, we show that diffusion transformers can provide representation guidance by themselves\nto boost generation performance with our proposed SRA, which aligns the output latent representa-\ntion of the diffusion transformer in earlier layer with higher noise to that in later layer with lower\nnoise to progressively enhance the overall representation learning during only generative process.\nMeanwhile, a few open questions are worth discussing. First, we have observed that the effect of\nSRA becomes more pronounced when scaling model size. However, owing to the limitation of\ncomputational resources, we are unable to further scale the model size and data. Investigating the\nscalability of SRA in more complex and resource-intensive scenarios ( e.g., text-to-image) will be\nan exciting future direction. Next, similar to other related works [74, 77, 9, 79], our method is\nalso experiment-driven. Exploring theoretical insights into why learning a good representation is\nbeneficial to generation will also be an exciting future direction.\nConsidering the simplicity and effectiveness of SRA, we believe it will facilitate more future re-\nsearches that focus on unveiling the intertwined nature of visual representation and generation.\n9\n\nReferences\n[1] Abdi, H., Williams, L.J.: Principal component analysis.

Similar\nto SiT, the latent representations in DiT basically follow the coarse to fine process, as block layers\nincrease and noise level decreased.\nB Descriptions for Two Types of Baseline Models\nIn this paper, we use DiT and SiT as our baseline models. We now provide an overview of two types\nof generative models that are variants of denoising autoencoders and are used to learn the target\ndistribution. Specifically, we discuss Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) like DiT\nin Section B.1 and Stochastic Interpolants Models like SiT in Section B.2.\nB.1 Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DiT)\nDenoise diffusion-based models [29, 55] aim to model the target distribution ( p(x)) by learning a\ngradual denoising process that transforms a Gaussian distribution ( N(0,I)) into p(x). Formally,\ndiffusion models learn a reverse process ( p(xt\u22121|xt)) corresponding to a pre-defined forward\nprocess ( q(xt|x0)), which incrementally adds Gaussian noise to the data starting from p(x)over a\nsequence of time steps ( t\u22081, . . . , T ), with T >0fixed.\nFor a given x0\u223cp(x), the forward process ( q(xt|xt\u22121)) is defined as: [ q(xt|xt\u22121) =\nN(xt;\u221a1\u2212\u03b2tx0, \u03b22\ntI), ] where \u03b2t\u2208(0,1)are pre-defined small hyperparameters. DDPM [29]\nformalizes the reverse process ( p(xt\u22121|xt)) as:\np(xt\u22121|xt) =N\u0010\nxt\u22121;1\u221a\u03b1t\u0000\nxt\u2212\u03c32\nt\u221a1\u2212\u00af\u03b1t\u03f5\u03b8(xt, t)\u0001\n,\u03a3\u03b8(xt, t)\u0011\n, (8)\nwhere \u03b1t= 1\u2212\u03b2t,\u00af\u03b1t=Qi= 1t\u03b1i, and \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t)is parameterized by a neural network.\nThe model is trained using a simple denoising autoencoder objective:\nLsimple =Ex\u2217,\u03f5,th\n||\u03f5\u2212\u03f5\u03b8(xt, t)||2\n2i\n. (9)\n15\n\nFor the covariance term ( \u03a3\u03b8(xt, t)), DDPM[29] demonstrated that setting it as ( \u03c32\ntI) with ( \u03b2t=\n\u03c32\nt) is sufficient. Subsequently, Improved-DDPM[55] showed that performance can be enhanced\nby jointly learning ( \u03a3\u03b8(xt, t)) along with ( \u03f5\u03b8(xt, t)) in a dimension-wise manner using the\nfollowing objective:\nLvlb= exp( vlog\u03b2t+ (1\u2212v) log \u02dc\u03b2t), (10)\nwhere vis a component per model output dimension, and \u02dc\u03b2t=1\u2212\u00af\u03b1t\u22121\n1\u2212\u00af\u03b1t\u03b2t.\nWith a sufficiently large Tand an appropriate scheduling of \u03b2t, the distribution p(xT)approaches\nan isotropic Gaussian distribution. Thus, sampling is achieved by starting from random Gaussian\nnoise and iteratively applying the reverse process ( p(xt\u22121|xt)) to recover a data sample x0[29].\nB.2 Stochastic Interpolants Models (SiT)\nUnlike DDPMs, flow-based models [48, 46] describe a continuous time-dependent process involving\ndata ( x\u2217\u223cp(x)) and Gaussian noise ( \u03f5\u223c N(0,I)) over t\u2208[0,1]:\nxt=\u03b1tx0+\u03c3t\u03f5, \u03b1 0=\u03c31= 1, \u03b11=\u03c30= 0, (11)\nwith\u03b1tand\u03c3tbeing decreasing and increasing functions of t, respectively. The process is governed\nby a probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF ODE):\n\u02d9xt=v(xt, t), (12)\nwhere the distribution of the ODE at time tmatches the marginal distribution pt(x).\nThe velocity v(x, t)is expressed as:\nv(x, t) =E[\u02d9xt|xt=x] = \u02d9\u03b1tE[x\u2217|xt=x] + \u02d9\u03c3tE[\u03f5|xt=x], (13)\nand can be approximated by a model v\u03b8(xt, t)trained to minimize the objective:\nLvelocity =Ex\u2217,\u03f5,th\n||v\u03b8(xt, t)\u2212\u02d9\u03b1tx\u2217\u2212\u02d9\u03c3t\u03f5||2i\n. (14)\nThis also corresponds to a reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) given by:\ndxt=v(xt, t)dt\u22121\n2wts(xt, t)dt+\u221awtd\u00afwt, (15)\nwhere the score s(xt, t)is defined as:\ns(xt, t) =\u22121\n\u03c3tE[\u03f5|xt=x]. (16)\nThe score s(xt, t)can also be approximated using a model s\u03b8(x, t), trained with the objective:\nLscore(\u03b8) =Ex\u2217,\u03f5,th\n||\u03c3ts\u03b8(xt, t) +\u03f5||2i\n. (17)\nAs shown in [2], any functions \u03b1tand\u03c3tthat satisfy the following three conditions:\n1. \u03b12\nt+\u03c32\nt>0,\u2200t\u2208[0,1]\n2. \u03b1tand\u03c3tare differentiable ,\u2200t\u2208[0,1]\n3. \u03b11=\u03c30= 0, \u03b10=\u03c31= 1,\nlead to an unbiased interpolation process between x0and\u03f5. Example choices include linear inter-\npolants ( \u03b1t= 1\u2212t,\u03c3t=t) or variance-preserving (VP) interpolants ( \u03b1t= cos(\u03c0\n2t),\u03c3t= sin(\u03c0\n2t))\n[52].\nAn advantage of stochastic interpolants is that the diffusion coefficient ( wt) can be independently\nselected during sampling with the reverse SDE, even after training. This capability simplifies the\ndesign space compared to score-based diffusion models [36].\n16\n\nTable 3: Defualt hyperparameter setup.

We implement our models based on the original DiT and SiT im-\nplementation. To speed up training and save GPU memory, we use mixed-precision (fp16) with a\ngradient clipping and FusedAttention [15] operation for attention computation. We also pre-compute\ncompressed latent vectors from raw pixels via stable diffusion V AE [62] and use these latent vectors.\nWe do not apply any data augmentation, but we find this does not lead to a big difference, as sim-\nilarly observed in MaskDiT [77] and REPA [74]. We also use stabilityai/sd-vae-ft-ema for\nencoding images to latent vectors and decoding latent vectors to images. For projection head used\nfor nonlinear transformation, we use two-layer MLP with SiLU activations [19]. The \u03bbis set to 0.04\nfor DiT and 0.2 for SiT initially and followed the rules: \u03bb=\u03bbinit\u22170.1(Ne\u2212150\n1000),where Ne>150is\nthe number of epoch, to change after 150 epochs for ensuring LgenandLsaat the same scale.\nWhen using SiT-XL to generate images with classifier-free guidance [31], the guidance interval\nintroduced in the study [40] with the same setting used in REPA [74] is applied, which has been\ndemonstrated to yield a slight performance improvement.\nLinear probing. We follow the setup used in REPA [74] and I-DAE [12], and use the code-base\nof ConvNeXt [50] to conduct the experiment. Specifically, we use AdaptiveAvgPooling and a batch\nnormalization layer to process the latent features output by the model, then train a linear layer for\n80 epochs. The batch size is set to 4096 with cosine decay learning rate scheduler, where the initial\nlearning rate is set to 0.001.\nComputing resources. We use 8 NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs or 8 NVIDIA L40S 48GB GPUs for\ntraining largest model (XL); and use 4 NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs or 4 NVIDIA L40S 48GB GPUs\nfor training smaller model (L, B), our training speed is about 2.12 step/s with a global batch size of\n256. When sampling, we use either NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs or NVIDIA L40S 48GB GPUs or\nNVIDIA RTX 4090 24GB GPUs to obtain the samples for evaluation.\nD Evaluation Metric\nIn this section we explain the main concept of metrics that we used for the evaluation.\n17\n\n\u2022FID [28] measures the feature distance between the distributions of real and generated images.\nIt uses the Inception-v3 network [66] and computes distance based on an assumption that both\nfeature distributions are multivariate gaussian distributions.\n\u2022sFID [54] proposes to compute FID with intermediate spatial features of the Inception-v3 net-\nwork to capture the generated images\u2019 spatial distribution.\n\u2022IS[64] also uses the Inception-v3 network but use logit for evaluation of the metric. Specifically,\nit measures a KL-divergence between the original label distribution and the distribution of logits\nafter the softmax normalization.\n\u2022Precision and recall [41] are based on their classic definitions: the fraction of realistic images\nand the fraction of training data manifold covered by generated data.\nE Baselines for Comparison\nIn what follows, we explain the main idea of baseline methods that we used for the evaluation.\n\u2022ADM [17] improves U-Net-based architectures for diffusion models and proposes classifier-\nguided sampling to balance the quality and diversity tradeoff and improve the performance.\n\u2022VDM++ [37] proposes a simple adaptive noise schedule for diffusion models to improve training\nefficiency.\n\u2022Simple diffusion [32] proposes a diffusion model for high-resolution image generation by ex-\nploring various techniques to simplify a noise schedule and architectures.\n\u2022CDM [30] introduces cascaded diffusion models and trains multiple diffusion models starting\nfrom the lowest resolution and applying one or more super-resolution diffusion models for gen-\nerating high-fidelity images.\n\u2022LDM [63] proposes latent diffusion models by modeling image distribution in a compressed\nlatent space to improve the training efficiency without sacrificing the generation performance.\n\u2022DiT[57] proposes a pure transformer backbone for training diffusion models based on proposing\nAdaIN-zero modules.\n\u2022SiT[52] extensively analyzes how DiT training can be efficient by moving from discrete diffu-\nsion to continuous flow-based modeling.\n\u2022SD-DiT [79] leverages IBOT\u2019s [78] training paradigm that combines DINO loss [8] and BEIT\nloss [4] for efficiently training diffusion transformers.\n\u2022MaskDiT [77] proposes an asymmetric encoder-decoder scheme for efficient training of diffu-\nsion transformers, where they train the model with an auxiliary mask reconstruction task similar\nto MAE [26].\n\u2022TREAD [39] introduces a dynamic token routing strategy combined with the mask reconstruc-\ntion task similar to MAE [26] and MaskDiT [77] to accelerate the training of diffusion models.\n\u2022REPA [74] achieves significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality\nby aligning latent feature of diffusion model with that of a large-scale data pre-trained represen-\ntation model ( e.g., DINOv2 [56]).\n\u2022MAETok changes the SD-V AE to MAE-Tok which is trained with auxiliary mask reconstruc-\ntion loss and align loss with three representation targets (HOG\u2019s [14], DINOv2\u2019s [56], and\nCLIP\u2019s [60]) and obtains diffusion transformer with better generation performance.\nF Convergence Speed Against REPA\nHere we provide quantitative comparison on convergence speed with SiT-XL baseline and SiT-XL\n+ REPA [74]. It is worth noting that REPA leverages a powerful representation foundation model\nwhose training data and resource are far beyond training a diffusion transformer on ImageNet.\nAs shown in Figure 8, although REPA converges quickly at the beginning of training due to its\nstrong representation prior, the performance saturates after about 200 epochs. On the contrary, in\nSRA, since the teacher\u2019s ability is constantly enhanced during training and thus better and better\n18\n\nFigure 8: Training epochs vs. FID plot without classifier-free guidance (CFG). The benefit of\nREPA encounters saturation after approximately 200 epochs, while our method provides continuous\nperformance improvement.\nguidance is provided, the continuous performance improvement can be achieved. From another\nperspective, the representation guidance signal in REPA is fixed in every timestep and epoch, while\nour supervision signal is dynamically changing. This provides a wider variety of learning cues to\nhelp the model continuously improve the performance.\nG Detailed Setup of Ablation Study\nWe now give the detailed experimental setup of Figure 6c in our ablation study. The accuracy rate\nof the horizontal axis in the figure is obtained by using the linear probing results of the original\nSiT-XL/2 checkpoint training for 7M iterations, while the vertical axis is the FID evaluation result\nof training 400K iterations with SRA without classifier-free guidance (CFG). Since we do not intro-\nduce any representation component and use the representation supervision signal only in generative\ntraining process, we consider this experiment can validate the effectiveness of our approach.\nH Ablation Results of DiT\nWe also perform a similar analysis with DiT like those have done in Figure 6c, the results are\nshowed in Figure 9. In short, we also observe that the generative capability of DiT with SRA is\nindeed strongly correlated with the representation guidance as observed in SiT with SRA.\nFigure 9: We also investigate the correlation between generation performance and the representation\nguidance of DiT + SRA. The similar tight coupling can also be seen.\n19\n\nI More Discussion on Related Work\nDiffusion transformers. Currently, the diffusion model is progressively transitioning from a U-\nNet-based architecture to a Transformer-based one, owing to the superior scalability of the latter. At\nthe beginning, U-ViT [3] shows transformer-based backbones with skip connections can be an ef-\nfective backbone for training diffusion models. Then, DiT [57] shows skip connections are not even\nnecessary components, and a pure transformer architecture can be a scalable architecture for train-\ning diffusion-based models. Based on DiT, SiT [52] shows the model can be further improved with\ncontinuous stochastic interpolants [2]. Moreover, Stable diffusion 3 [20], Lumina-Image 2.0 [59]\nand FLUX 1 [42] show pure transformers can be scaled up for challenging text-to-image generation,\nand this characteristic is also verified by Sora [5], CogvideoX [72] and Wan [69] in text-to-video\nfield. Our work fouces on improves the training of DiT (and SiT) architecture based on our proposed\nself-representation alignment.\nExploring representation capacity of diffusion models. With the success of diffusion models to\ngenerate detailed images, many works have attempted to test out whether the discriminative seman-\ntic information can be found in diffusion models. GD [53] and DDAE [70] first observe that the\nintermediate representations of diffusion models have discriminative properties. Driving from this\nfinding, I-DAE [12] deconstructs diffusion models to be a self-supervised Learner. Moreover, Rep-\nfusion [71] and DreamTeacher [43] propose knowledge distillation schemes using diffusion models\nto perform various downstream tasks ( e.g., semantic segmentation and object detection). Our work\nalso try to explore representation capacity of diffusion model, but we focus on leveraging the repre-\nsentations in diffusion transformers to enhance their generation capacity.\nApplying representation guidance to other generation tasks. In addition to pre-training of the\nclass-conditional diffusion model, applying representation guidance can benefit other generation\ntasks. For example, lbGen [34] utilizes text feature from CLIP [60] as a low-biased reference to\nregulate diffusion model for low-biased dataset synthetics. RCG [44] focuses on unconditional\ngeneration, which first use the features from self-supervised image encoder to train a representation\ngenerator and subsequently used it output as the \u2018label\u2019 for image generation by a second generator.\nDiff-AE [58] uses a learnable encoder for discovering the high-level semantics and a diffusion model\nfor modeling stochastic, these dual-encoding improves realistic of the generated images on attribute\nmanipulation and image interpolation tasks. Different from these works, our study focus on class-\nconditional diffusion transformer\u2019s pre-training and exploiting representation guidance in itself and\nits own training paradigm. But we also believe our plug-and-play method can be easily applied to\nother tasks with benefits.\nJ More Qualitative Results\nBelow we show some uncurated generation results on ImageNet 256 \u00d7256 from the SiT-XL + SRA.\nWe use classifier-free guidance with w= 4.0.\n20\n\nFigure 10: Uncurated samples of loggerhead turtle (class label: 33).\nFigure 11: Uncurated samples of sulphur-crested cockatoo (class label: 89).\n21\n\nFigure 12: Uncurated samples of golden retriever (class label: 207).\nFigure 13: Uncurated samples of white fox (class label: 279).\n22\n\nFigure 14: Uncurated samples of tiger (class label: 292).\nFigure 15: Uncurated samples of red panda (class label: 387).\n23\n\nFigure 16: Uncurated samples of acoustic guitar (class label: 402).\nFigure 17: Uncurated samples of balloon (class label: 417).\n24\n\nFigure 18: Uncurated samples of baseball (class label: 429).\nFigure 19: Uncurated samples of fire truck (class label: 555).\n25\n\nFigure 20: Uncurated samples of ice cream (class label: 928).\nFigure 21: Uncurated samples of cheeseburger (class label: 933).\n26\n\nFigure 22: Uncurated samples of coral reef (class label: 973).\nFigure 23: Uncurated samples of lakeside (class label: 975).\n27\n\n",

Despite the benefits of incorporating explanations in models, an urgent need is found in addressing the privacy concerns of providing this additional information to end users. In this article, we conduct a scoping review of existing literature to elicit details on the conflict between privacy and explainability. Using the standard methodology for scoping review, we extracted 57 articles from 1,943 studies published from January 2019 to December 2024. The review addresses 3 research questions to present readers with more understanding of the topic: (1) what are the privacy risks of releasing explanations in AI systems? (2) what current methods have researchers employed to achieve privacy preservation in XAI systems?  (3) what constitutes a privacy preserving explanation? Based on the knowledge synthesized from the selected studies, we categorize the privacy risks and preservation methods in XAI and propose the characteristics of privacy preserving explanations to aid researchers and practitioners in understanding the requirements of XAI that is privacy compliant. Lastly, we identify the challenges in balancing privacy with other system desiderata and provide recommendations for achieving privacy preserving XAI. We expect that this review will shed light on the complex relationship of privacy and explainability, both being the fundamental principles of Trustworthy AI.

These software systems are built on human designed algorithms and produce a trace of the logic used to generate an output. Even in complex systems, it is possible for software experts to analyze the logic and generate an explanation for a specific result. During the software development lifecycle, engineers focus on creating the algorithm and validating using well designed test cases that closely replicate real world scenarios. In contrast, modern AI systems do not have an underlying human-written algorithm and learn from data fed to them. This data-driven nature creates dependence of the system on data quality [111] and introduces problems such as lack of fairness when data is biased, or irrelevant results when data is incomplete or outdated [173]. During the AI development phase, engineers access training datasets, which may contain personally identifiable or sensitive information about individuals. For neural network systems, the development process is primarily a trial-and-error approach, where high accuracy is targeted by tweaking the hyperparameters such as the learning rate, epochs, batch sizes or architecture of the system, such as the number or type of layers or activation functions. The lack of an algorithm prevents engineers from tracing through the AI system and interpreting the results. Thus, the basic ability to be explainable and understand input-output behaviors, which is critical to all computer systems [162], is often out of reach of AI systems. Explanations are crucial in high-risk applications [117] in domains such as healthcare [43, 50, 191], finance [50, 200], defense [50], justice [42], energy and power [105] where the impact on human life and well-being is significant [88, 109, 128] and the inability to do so deters their successful implementation [128, 153, 191]. Trustworthy AI strives to mitigate risks arising from AI systems due to possible harms from their data-driven nature. Trustworthiness is based on foundation principles of reliability, validity, robustness, privacy, explainability, fairness [5, 165] and other fundamental qualities that boost user confidence in the system outputs. Among these principles, explainability aims to bring the much-needed transparency in opaque models and can be considered as a non-functional requirement of a software system to mitigate opacity [30]. There are numerous benefits of including explanations in AI models. Besides aiding data scientists in getting a better understanding of the data [76] and performing required data cleansing [32], explanations can help developers in detecting errors in input and determining features that can be modified to change the outcome [41]. When multiple models are available with similar accuracy, an explanation method can help to choose between models [44]. Interpretable models can enable knowledge discovery by detecting knowledge or patterns that were missed by uninterpretable ones [89]. Since humans remain an important component in the decision-making process as end-users and consumers of automated decisions [167], explanations can give them an understanding of the model outcome especially when they are adversely affected by the decisions [4]. It can also facilitate privacy awareness in end-users [23], enabling them to make right choices for their personal data and aid regulators and compliance officers to understand the compliance of models [109] with applicable regulations. With generative AI (Gen-AI) and large language models (LLMs) entering mainstream, explanations constitute an important design principle [183] in enabling a better mental model for users [160] and in communicating its capabilities and limitations to them [183]. It can also support users in effective prompt engineering to determine the words that impact the output of a model [115] and in verification of generated content to mitigate the problem of hallucinations [146].  \n\n3 1.2 Challenges for privacy in explainability In many application domains of AI such as healthcare, finance and justice, training models on sensitive personal information is inevitable for usefulness of these systems [176]. For instance, a lung cancer detection model would require training on chest X-ray images, which constitutes personal information of patients. Similarly, a loan evaluation model of a bank, would require training on the financial health of customers, which is also personal to individuals. Usage of personal data impacts the privacy of individuals when they are subject to intentional or unintentional identification and exposure through these systems. Some models are found to memorize data contained in the input [156] which can be exploited by adversaries for extraction of personal information. Gen-AI models create new content from large datasets in text, audio and image formats [160] which could potentially contain sensitive personal information [112]. LLMs are also found to leak the privacy of the data used in prompts during in-context learning [48, 166]. Due to such privacy risks involved, when personal data is used in training, testing, or inferencing on AI models, they become subject to data regulation and privacy acts [78].  Explainability is a foundation principle of Trustworthy AI, however, introducing explanations in AI systems is found to create a tension with the privacy of the system. Explanation interfaces are found to give adversaries an additional attack surface [49, 99] to mine the information contained in the model. Researchers have demonstrated privacy attacks targeting explanations to retrieve information about membership in the training set [99, 126, 151], build surrogates of the target model [3, 181, 190], infer sensitive attributes of individuals [49, 103] and reconstruct the complete training set [151]. These attacks are demonstrated across different types of XAI methods including those that are currently used in commercial production systems. In addition to privacy attacks, the content of explanations may also inadvertently expose information that is proprietary [114] and hence valuable and confidential to organizations [185] or sensitive to individuals, thus causing breach of data and privacy regulations. Hence researchers have highlighted the urgent need of mitigating privacy leakage through explanation interfaces [103, 133, 190]. Due to these concerns of the privacy vulnerabilities of explanations, necessary privacy preservation measures are required in XAI systems [3, 151, 203].  1.3 Main contributions Previous research has identified that the privacy issues in explainability are insufficiently studied [99, 103, 126] despite its criticality in achieving safety in AI transparency. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no work that provides an in-depth understanding of the conflict between privacy and explainability in AI. Hence, we focus this article on these two fundamental desiderata of Trustworthy AI and explore the landscape of privacy risks and preservation methods proposed in literature in the context of XAI. The key questions that we have designed to define the scope of this article are: RQ1: What are the privacy risks of releasing explanations in AI systems? RQ2: What current methods have researchers employed to achieve privacy preservation in XAI systems?  RQ3: What constitutes a privacy preserving explanation?  We conducted a scoping review guided by RQ1 and RQ2. Based on the knowledge gathered from the extracted studies, we propose characteristics of privacy preserving XAI and outline them with the help of practical use cases to answer RQ3. Our main contributions in this article are as follows: - Categorization of reported privacy risks in XAI. We review the conflict between privacy and explainability in current literature and categorize the risks. - Exploration of applicable privacy preservation methods in XAI. We determine the privacy preserving methods that are applicable to XAI and report the progress achieved by researchers in integrating them in XAI systems. \n\n4 - Privacy preserving XAI characteristics. We propose the desirable characteristics of privacy preserving XAI to provide researchers and practitioners a checklist for achieving the tradeoff between privacy, utility and explainability. The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a brief background on XAI including its definition, evolution, categorization of explanation approaches and related reviews. In Section 3, we present the details of our scoping review methodology for extracting studies relevant to our research questions. Sections 4 and 5 synthesize the results from the scoping review. In Section 4, we consolidate both intentional and unintentional privacy risks of explanators to answer RQ1. In Section 5, we elaborate the use of privacy preserving methods on explanators and the existing works that utilize them in response to RQ2. Section 6 proposes the characteristics of privacy preserving XAI and answers RQ3. We conclude the article by discussing the results and highlight the open issues, challenges, and recommendations for future work in Section 7 and conclusions in Section 8.  2 BACKGROUND 2.1 Definition of XAI In 2017, DARPA kickstarted its 4-year XAI program to accelerate research in the development of explanation methods and interfaces that enhance understanding and trust of end-users [68]. The program defined XAI as \u201cAI systems that can explain their rationale to a human user, characterize their strengths and weaknesses, and convey an understanding of how they will behave in the future\u201d [68]. The study established users\u2019 preference for systems with explanations over systems that provided only decisions. Ribeiro et al. [140] refer to explanations of predictions as qualitative artifacts that provide the relationship between an input instance and the output prediction.   \n Figure 1: Important milestones and inception of privacy attacks/defenses in XAI. 2.2 Evolution of XAI and corresponding privacy issues The field of explainability can be traced to the early 1990s, driven by the lack of clarity on the outputs of black-box models. Early works [12, 37, 96, 113, 170] have used different approaches for extracting rules from these systems. The rise of deep \n\n\n5 learning and the improvement in the accuracy of black-box systems, propelled complex uninterpretable systems into mainstream usage. However, their use in critical domains remains a challenge due to their lack of transparency. Regulations, such as the GDPR\u2019s rights related to automated decision-making including profiling [63], contributed to bringing the urgent need for explanations and hence the field of XAI into the forefront and resulted in an exponential growth in proposed explainability methods. However, the introduction of transparency through XAI methods also introduced privacy leakage through explanation interfaces described in early works [114, 150, 151] in the form of privacy attacks on the training data and the underlying model. Correspondingly, researchers have also explored defenses and pioneering works in this field [71, 133] have proposed different strategies for generating privacy preserved explanations. Currently the privacy issues in XAI are far from being resolved, with new attacks being discovered and researchers proposing corresponding mitigation measures to alleviate the risks. Figure 1 summarizes the main milestones in the field of XAI and indicates the timeline of discovery of privacy issues and proposed defenses.  2.3 Categorization of XAI In recent years, several different XAI methods have been proposed. Broadly, explainability can be achieved using inherently interpretable models or applying post-hoc methods on trained models [71]. Methods specific to certain model types and capabilities, are referred to as model-specific while those independent of the model are referred to as model-agnostic [50]. In this subsection, we discuss the main categories into which XAI methods are grouped in existing literature (Table 1), based on the underlying mechanism used to derive explanations. Since there is a broad spectrum of available explainability methods, we limit ourselves to a selection of methods to give readers sufficient understanding of the terminologies used in subsequent sections. For a comprehensive review of XAI categories and methods, we refer the reader to other related reviews listed in Section 2.4. 2.3.1 Interpretable methods These AI models are understandable by design [8]. They have embedded rules or transparent architecture that facilitates the understanding of the input-output logic of the system. They are also referred to as white-box or transparent models. Decision trees, Bayesian networks, linear/logistic regression, k-nearest neighbours, rule based systems and general additive models [8, 120, 138] are some examples of interpretable models. According to Arrieta et al. [8], different transparent models possess different degrees of transparency given by the properties of simulatability, decomposability and algorithmic transparency.  Though interpretable models are promising in aiding the understandability of a system, they have limitations. A major setback to their successful adoption as explainable-by-design methods, is their lower accuracy [16, 53, 68] compared to better performing black-box models such as deep learning systems. When the accuracy gains between these model types is substantial, there is an unwillingness to trade performance with interpretability. Interpretable models also lack natural language explanations, making them unsuitable for use by non-technical users [15]. For models such as decision trees, the understandability deteriorates as the complexity, i.e., the depth of the tree increases [145]. Nonetheless, due to their intrinsically transparent architecture, interpretable models are often used as surrogates for black-box models [109]. The use of multiple surrogate models facilitates the availability of different types of explanations [50] improving the overall interpretability of the system. For trustworthy explanations, surrogates are expected to generate accurate approximations of black-box models, failing which the usefulness of the explanations can deteriorate [191]. \n\n6 2.3.2 Example-based methods These methods use examples, i.e., data instances as samples to explain the model [109]. The instances may be from the training set or generated by the method [84, 95]. These methods are also referred to as record-based [150], instance-based [65] or case-based [122] methods in literature. They can complement feature-based methods to aid understandability of the end users [83] and also improve the interpretability of complex distributions [89]. They are intuitive and natural in their ability to provide explanations to humans [84]. Some methods in this category are anchors [141], contrastive explanations [44], counterfactuals [178] , influence functions [90] and prototypes and criticisms [89]. Example-based explanations, though easily interpretable by end-users, can cause breach of privacy when datapoints are revealed as explanations [151, 176]. Among the different example-based methods, counterfactuals are effective for understandability, however, they can aid adversaries in determining the change in input required to alter an output to a different classification. Such manipulation of output can have undesirable consequences in critical domains [105]. 2.3.3 Knowledge-based methods These methods utilize knowledge representation techniques in machine learning (ML) models [168]. The integration of background knowledge [74] facilitates the inclusion of context [93, 132], thus increasing the trustworthiness of explanations. Neuro-symbolic [74] or in-between methods [79] is an emerging field that explores integration of symbolic AI approaches from knowledge representation and reasoning with subsymbolic or connectionist based approaches [73]. A neuro-symbolic hybrid can enable the integration of the resilience of neural approaches with the interpretability of symbolic approaches. Semantic web technologies offer tools for semantic interpretation and reasoning from knowledge bases [147]. Knowledge graphs, expressed using Resource Description Framework, and ontologies, expressed using Web Ontology Language, are the common tools that can be deployed for explainability. Knowledge graphs have applicability as pre-model and post-model XAI for extracting features and relations from data as well as for inferencing and reasoning [137]. The field of semantic web technologies in explainability is attractive because of its potential of creating knowledge-rich explanations without adversely affecting the performance of the system [147]. 2.3.4 Feature-based methods These explanation methods score or measure the effect of individual input features on the output of the model [8, 14, 50, 159]. They are also referred to as feature importance [109], feature relevance [8] or attribution-based [99] methods. They are based on the attribution problem which is the distribution of the output of a model for a specific input to its base features [161]. Two important categories of feature-based methods identified in literature are perturbation and backpropagation-based methods [7, 109]. - Perturbation-based methods remove, alter, or mask an input feature or set of features and observe the difference with the original output [109]. Some perturbation-based methods are LIME [140], permutation feature importance [22], SHAP [101] and MASK [59]. - Backpropagation-based methods compute input attributions in forward and backward passes of the network [7]. The use of the gradient of the output with the respective input features [109, 159] is a common approach in these methods and is referred to as gradient-based approach. Methods used on images that determine the global importance of pixels, generate saliency maps, and are referred to as pixel-level attribution methods [86, 120]. Some examples of backpropagation-based methods are gradient [155], gradient x input [154], guided backpropagation [158] and integrated gradients [162]. \n\n7 Compared to backpropagation, perturbation-based methods require running the model with different sets of input, hence they are slower [7] and increasing the number of features increases the performance time [86]. Moreover, when perturbation-based methods are used in neural networks, obtaining reliable results for all permutations is challenging due to non-linearity and dependence of the outcome on the exact set of features [86]. Though feature-based explanations are popular and used by many Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms [103], the explanations though useful to researchers, are found to be difficult to understand by end-users [176].

Though current literature has reviews covering different aspects of XAI, to the best of our knowledge there is a lack of comprehensive review that considers the tension of privacy with explainability. Our work fills this gap and is unique in comparison to other existing reviews. In this subsection, we identify related reviews on XAI and summarize their focus areas.  An in-depth overview of the core concepts and taxonomies in XAI was provided by Arrieta et al. [8]. Mohseni et al. [118] executed an interdisciplinary survey and provided a framework for XAI design and evaluation methods. Dwivedi et al. [50] covered a wide breadth of explanation algorithms, programming frameworks and software toolkits for XAI development. Ali et al. [4] surveyed explainability through the lens of trustworthiness and elaborated on evaluation metrics, packages and XAI datasets. Bodria et al. [19] categorized explanation methods and benchmarked popular methods using quantitative metrics. Muralidar et al. [125] reviewed transparency elements from HCI in the context of explanations while Cambria et al. [25] explored the presentation methods and usage of natural language with XAI. In addition to these broad surveys on explainability, researchers have also surveyed specific application domains such as healthcare [135, 191],  cybersecurity [27] and energy and power systems [105]. Reviews on specific XAI categories and methods also exist, such as counterfactuals [67], data-driven knowledge-aware XAI systems [95], knowledge-graph based XAI [137, 168] and semantic web technologies for explanations [147]. The use of XAI with federated learning, termed as Federated XAI (Fed-\n\n8 XAI), was reviewed by L\u00f3pez-Blanco et al. [100]. H. Zhao et al. [201] surveyed explainability for transformer-based language models and categorized methods based on training paradigms.  The review in this article differs from the above reviews in that it explores the risks to privacy arising from including explainability in AI systems. Further, we review strategies used by researchers in mitigating the privacy leakage in XAI. We use an established scoping review strategy guided by well-defined research questions. Our taxonomy of XAI, privacy risks and corresponding mitigation methods are distilled from the widely accepted understanding of the privacy and XAI community in existing literature. Our review methodology facilitates the answering of the identified research questions from the extracted studies. 3 METHOD We conducted a scoping review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) [172]. In this section, we elaborate the process followed and the identified research trends. 3.1 Literature Selection and Extraction  We followed a 4-step process comprising of identification, screening, eligibility, and extraction as depicted in Figure 2. In the first step, namely, identification, Elsevier Engineering Village [54] search platform was used and the search was conducted on Compendex and Inspec databases, which indexes publications from major computer science publishers including IEEE, ACM, Springer and Elsevier. A search string was formulated using the two main concepts of privacy and explainability and applied on the title, subject, and abstract fields. For reproducibility, the search and inclusion criteria used to retrieve the relevant studies is as follows: - Search string: (privacy OR confidential* OR \u201cmembership inference\u201d OR \u201cmodel inversion\u201d OR \u201cmodel extract*\u201d OR \u201cmodel reconstruct*\u201d OR \u201cproperty inference\u201d) AND (explainab* OR explanat* OR interpretab* OR XAI OR recourse OR \u201ctransparency report\u201d). - Period of publication: January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2024. The start year was chosen based on the seminal works [114, 150, 151] published on this topic. - Date of most recent search: Jan 6, 2025 - Type of publications included: journal articles, conference articles, book chapters, articles in press. - Type of publications excluded: preprints, unpublished papers, dissertations, books, standards, report chapters, notes, report reviews, editorials, erratum, retracted documents. - Language: English  - Inclusion criteria: Study should describe at least one privacy risk or privacy preservation method in XAI.  \n\n9  Figure 2: Scoping review process as per PRISMA-ScR.  The search results comprising of 3,766 studies were exported from Engineering Village and imported into Covidence [205] review management software. During the import process, the software eliminated duplicate studies retrieved from both databases, retaining only unique records. After deduplication, 1,943 studies were forwarded for screening. A researcher screened the title and abstract to determine relevance to RQ1 or RQ2 considering the inclusion criteria. Out of 1,943 studies, 69 studies were moved to the next step to determine eligibility wherein the full text of the identified articles were examined with respect to RQ1 and RQ2. During this stage, those that addressed only security issues in explainability, privacy issues in ML, or survey papers were eliminated. This resulted in removal of 17 studies. During this stage, 5 relevant studies that did not appear in the original search results, were found through forward and backward searches. These were added to the pool resulting in extraction of 57 studies. 3.2 Research Trends Each extracted study was categorized under the appropriate research question. The distribution of these studies for RQ1 (i.e., XAI privacy risks) and RQ2 (i.e., XAI privacy preservation) by year, can be seen in Figure 3 (a). As observed, there is an increase in reported privacy risks in XAI methods in the period considered. Correspondingly, there is also an increase in the number of studies on the use of various privacy preservation methods in XAI as observed from Figure 3 (b). Differential privacy and anonymization are the popular privacy preservation methods used with XAI methods. Among the privacy risks identified, 3 attacks, namely, membership inference, model inversion and model extraction, have similar \n\n\n10 proportion of studies as seen in Figure 3 (c). One privacy attack, namely, property inference, is not tested in XAI systems. Figure 3 (d) shows the categories of XAI targeted by different attacks. As observed, feature-based and example-based XAI are mainly targeted for privacy attacks in comparison to interpretable methods. To the best of our knowledge, no attacks are reported on knowledge-based methods.  \n  \n  Figure 3: Research trends identified from extracted studies. 4 PRIVACY RISKS IN XAI Traditionally privacy is referred to as the \u201cright to be left alone\u201d [182] and the \u201cclaim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others\" [184]. In the modern context, with availability, collection, and collation of copious information about individuals through online and offline sources, the concept of information privacy is more applicable and refers to the ability of individuals to exert control on their own data [38]. Clarke has defined information privacy as the \u201cclaims of individuals that data about themselves should generally not be available to other individuals and organizations, and that, where data is possessed by another party, the individual must be able to exercise a substantial degree of control over that data and its use\u201d [34]. In this article, we refer to the last definition of privacy. During the training process, ML models feed on large amounts of data. More data is provided to the models, in the form of queries, during inference time. If a model uses or creates personal data, it falls within the scope of data protection regulations [78]. Consider an example of a model that makes decisions on the credit card application of an individual. The \n\n\n11 model would typically require query data in the form of personal details such as annual salary, age, credit rating and other sensitive fields to determine an approval or rejection. In this case, the outcome of the application is a decision made on the individual and is also considered as personal data. Usage of personal data in the training or inferencing process of models, make them subject to privacy regulations. In XAI, the output is accompanied by an explanation of the result, also referred to as transparency report, and provides further insights into the decision-making process of the model [151]. When the explanation contains or leaks personal data, it constitutes a privacy risk [203]. Trustworthy AI is built on explainability as one of its ingrained principles. Explainability assists in gaining insights into the functionalities of a black-box AI system [165], however, the relationship between privacy and explainability has contrasting aspects. Explainability aids privacy in several ways such as, in creating privacy awareness in users [23], in ascertaining that privacy of a system is achieved [46, 124], and in determining correlations with identifiable data for removal [76]. On the downside, explanations can reveal sensitive information contained in models and training data [71, 138, 203] thus leading to privacy risks [92]. Thus, there are conflicting outcomes [30, 66, 130, 144, 157] of including explainability as a non-functional requirement in AI systems. In the following subsections, we answer RQ1 by discussing the threat model of XAI to elaborate the assets, actors, and the type of privacy risks, AI systems with explanations are vulnerable to. 4.1 System Assets To understand the privacy risks in XAI, we first focus on the assets (Figure 4) that need privacy protection. Assuming that the model has been trained on personal data and that the model also needs personal data in the form of queries for generation of outputs and explanations, the following potential artifacts are vulnerable to privacy breaches: 1. training data 2. query data 3. model outputs (prediction or classification or recommendation in discriminative models or generated content in generative models [160]) 4. explanation of outputs (i.e., transparency reports) 5. model architecture and hyperparameters The first four assets above, can be intuitively understood as containing personal data to different degrees. If the model is not trained on personal data and does not output any personally identifiable or sensitive information, it falls outside the scope of privacy risks [78]. The fifth asset, i.e., model architecture and hyperparameters, is susceptible to loss of confidentiality. Organizations spend manpower, time, and effort in collecting and curating data and in training and deploying their models. Hence it holds commercial value [198] and an exposure would breach intellectual property [16, 139, 198], proprietary value [114] and confidentiality [105, 176]. Since models can be argued as sources of data, allowing data to be estimated from them with different degrees of accuracy [175], a breach of the model can lead to breach of training and query data, thus leading to privacy risk. \n\n12  Figure 4: Assets that pose privacy risks in XAI. 4.2 System Actors The AI lifecycle [129, 149] (Figure 5) consists of a data acquisition phase where pertinent datasets are explored and preprocessed as needed. This is followed by model development where the appropriate model is chosen and hyperparameters decided. The model is trained on the datasets, and its performance evaluated on criteria such as accuracy and training time. Finally, the model is deployed in the real-world setting. Most AI models require monitoring and appropriate tuning while in this phase. Models eventually become obsolete and require appropriate retirement at the end of the cycle. XAI, being an AI system, follows the phases of the AI lifecycle. Data curators, developers, software architects and quality engineers [30] are the main actors involved in the initial phases involving development and evaluation. Once the system is deployed in production, it is accessible by various end-users through APIs or GUIs as needed. While in production, valid actors such as developers and quality engineers may need to see transparency reports when end-users challenge results and during calibration of AI systems [10].  \n Figure 5: Different phases of AI lifecycle.  \n\n\n13 During different phases, the system can become accessible to adversaries. These may secure different levels of access to an XAI. In white-box access, adversaries possess information about the model internals such as architecture and hyperparameters [97, 198]. In black-box access, adversaries access the input/output of the system [97] without any knowledge of the training process or model internals [142]. Any intermediate access between white-box and black-box is referred to as gray-box [80]. While unintentional privacy leaks may occur during the different lifecycle phases or during the course of an explanation [138], adversaries are associated with intentional privacy breaches. They may act as passive observers [80] and use the model outputs for launching privacy attacks, or they may actively interfere in the training process of the model [127]. Thus, XAI systems require adequate protection mechanisms from both intentional and unintentional privacy leakage (Figure 6). \n Figure 6: Categorization of privacy risks in XAI. 4.3 Intentional Privacy Leakage In this subsection, we review intentional privacy risks in the form of privacy attacks by adversaries. Since XAI systems are essentially AI systems with an additional asset, i.e., explanations, they are vulnerable to malicious attacks applicable to AI models. Previous research has determined security attacks targeting AI, such as evasion and poisoning [136]. However, in our review we differentiate from these security attacks and focus on privacy attacks that target personal data of individuals or model confidentiality. Below we summarize these attacks in the XAI context where model explanations further aid [203] the identification or exposure of personal information of individuals or the intellectual property of the model owner. Table 2 summarizes these risks and the works detailing them. 4.3.1 Membership Inference This is a privacy risk of identification of an individual in the training set of a model [152, 196] (Figure 7). In this attack, the adversary can have black-box or white-box access to the model [175] after it has been deployed in production. This risk is significant since datasets used in critical domains, may reveal sensitive information about individuals used in training the model [152]. An example of membership inference is when an individual\u2019s personal details, such as age, gender, medical conditions, and other attributes, are known to an adversary and is used to determine if he/she was part of the training data of a disease detection model, thus indicating the individual may have the disease with a high chance [77]. Overfitting of the target model is identified as a main cause of membership inference [82, 194]. \n\n\n14  \n Figure 7: Membership inference exploiting explanations. The seminal work on membership inference on feature-based and example-based XAI systems was demonstrated by Shokri et al. [150, 151]. The study used various backpropagation and perturbation methods to show the vulnerability of feature-based systems. The proposed attack used variances in the prediction and explanation vectors to differentiate between members and non-members. H. Liu et al. [99] proposed membership inference on feature-based XAI using model performance and robustness metrics. The study observed higher loss in confidence on perturbation of important features for members and utilized this observation in training an attack model, in addition to using the performance loss from the model. Ma et al. [104] used Shapley value explanations to improve label-only membership inference, that employs hard prediction labels instead of confidence scores for determining membership [33]. Explanations were used to improve neighbourhood sampling thus reducing the number of queries. In the example-based category, Shokri et al. [150, 151] considered influence functions on logistic regression models. Since the explanations from influence functions consist of actual datapoints, the study observed that attackers could obtain certainty about membership, thus leading to stronger attacks. Cohen and Giryes [35] considered self-influence functions instead, that show the influence of a datapoint on its own prediction. The demonstrated attack required white-box access to the target neural network parameters, activations, and gradients. The choice of a good threshold range for self-influence scores for members was crucial for this attack and was achieved by maximizing the balanced accuracy on the training set. Kuppa and Le-Khac [92] used a different type of example-based explanation, namely, counterfactuals, for membership inference. The authors trained shadow models using counterfactual samples and auxiliary datasets. The use of a threshold, on the difference in predictions of the attack and target models, was employed to determine membership. Pawelczyk et al. [134] also targeted counterfactuals and proposed two types of attacks. The first relied on the distances between data points and their counterfactuals to differentiate between members and non-members. The second used a loss-based approach using a likelihood-ratio test [28] that improved the attack. Interpretable models using decision trees, and surrogate models created using Trepan algorithm [37], were evaluated for membership inference by Naretto et al. [126]. The authors also studied the effect of overfitting on the attack. The study found the success of membership inference higher on both interpretable and surrogate models in comparison to black-box models. The attack was also more successful on surrogates of overfitted models in comparison to well-regularized models. Membership inference in machine learning models has been explored extensively in existing literature [77] and attacks have exploited confidence scores and predictions [152]. However, the above attacks that exploit explanations, suggest that XAI interfaces provide a new avenue for adversaries to launch this attack. So far, the attack has targeted feature-based, example-based, and interpretable (including surrogates) XAI methods. Factors such as dataset type [151], dimension [134, \n\n\n15 151], model architecture [151] and overfitting [134], influence the effectiveness of this attack. Some demonstrated attacks are also possible without knowledge of the training dataset or target architectures [99]. Interpretable models are often suggested as surrogates for explaining black-box models [109], however as demonstrated by these attacks, this layer of interpretability can introduce a backdoor to the target system and lead to privacy leaks [126]. In the example-based category, influence functions display training datapoints that are influential for a point of interest and are a direct breach of privacy of the training data [151]. They can also lead to exposure of outliers due to their distinct characteristics and higher influence on the training process [151]. Among feature-based methods, those using perturbations are comparatively resilient to membership inference due to use of out-of-distribution points, however, this can also impact explanation fidelity [151]. Feature-based methods with better explanation quality are also found to be susceptible to higher leakage [99] suggesting a conflict between privacy and utility. 4.3.2 Model Inversion This type of privacy risk is found to be of two types, namely, data reconstruction and training class inference [198]. In this attack, the adversary can have black-box or white-box access to the model [60, 175] after it has been deployed in production. In data reconstruction (Figure 8), individuals\u2019 data used in training or querying [203] the model is recovered partly or completely and constitutes a risk of exposure [45]. Attribute inference is a type of data reconstruction that can determine the values of certain attributes, generally those sensitive to individuals [65, 194] such as gender, age, race, and others. In the second type of model inversion, i.e., training class inference, it is possible to recover a representative record for a required target class [45, 192, 198].  \n Figure 8: Model inversion exploiting explanations. In XAI, model inversion attacks are reported on example-based, feature-based, and interpretable systems. Shokri et al. [150, 151] demonstrated a data reconstruction attack on influence functions in logistic regression models and found the attack dependent on data dimensionality. The authors designed different heuristics for low and high dimension data to improve coverage and efficiently recover more training points. Goethals et al. [64] showed an explanation linkage attack using native counterfactuals generated from actual instances of the training data. The attack demonstrated the vulnerability of counterfactuals in leaking private attributes. Private images were found to be susceptible to recovery through saliency maps by X. Zhao et al. [203] leading to inadvertent exposure. XAI systems that provided class-specific multiple explanations were prone to more leakage. The authors also used attention transfer to demonstrate the risk for non-explanation models. Other works, such as Duddu and \n\n\n16 Boutet [49] and X. Luo et al. [103], have focused on attribute inference on tabular data using feature-based XAI. The former, trained attack models using predictions and explanations, to infer sensitive features. The latter used Shapley values and effectively executed the attack with limited number of queries on cloud ML services. Toma and Kikuchi [169] further showed that the efficacy of their proposed attack was dependent on the combination of black-box architecture and XAI method, with linear models using Shapley values, being more vulnerable to attribute inference. Ferry et al. [56] designed a probabilistic white-box attack applicable to transparent models, such as decision trees and rule lists, and quantified the information about the training data contained in the model. The work found that models built using greedy algorithms leak more information compared to those built using optimal strategies. The authors also observed the attack\u2019s capacity for misuse in launching other inference attacks such as membership and property inference. The above attacks from current literature, demonstrate the leakage of privacy through XAI methods leading to exposure of personal data or sensitive attributes of individuals through explanations. Model explanations provide an effective attack surface compared to predictions [49, 203] and constitute a privacy risk indicating the contradiction between the need for explanations in Trustworthy AI and protecting privacy [203]. Data reconstruction attacks impact active users of AI systems rather than training data as in membership inference, putting end-users at risk [203] and thus having a higher impact. In certain proposed model inversion attacks, sensitive attributes can be retrieved from models trained on non-sensitive attributes [49] while other proposed attacks demonstrate higher leakage from more important attributes [103] and recovery of entire training datasets [151]. In addition, the above works highlight the misuse of XAI techniques even for models that do not provide explanations [203]. There is also a conflict of privacy seen with the utility of the system. For instance, synthetic counterfactuals created by perturbing actual samples can provide resilience to inversion in comparison to native counterfactuals, however, their use is found to affect the plausibility and runtime of explanations [64], suggesting degrading utility. Similarly, for improving understandability of end-users, multiple diverse explanations are usually recommended [177], however they are also found to contribute to leakage of privacy, suggesting that explanation APIs should be restricted [203] thus adversely affecting the utility to end-users. 4.3.3 Model Extraction This type of risk breaches the confidentiality of the target model and is a threat to the intellectual property of the model owner (Figure 9). It is also referred to as model stealing since the functionality of the model can be replicated to a significant degree of accuracy and fidelity [80]. Since the extracted models can further leak personal data through membership inference and model inversion [156], model extraction can indirectly lead to identification and exposure of individuals. This attack is usually used as a starting point for initiating other types of attacks [3, 116]. In a typical model extraction attack, the adversary has black-box access to a victim model in production and uses an unlabeled dataset to query it, thus generating labels to build an attack dataset [190]. The labeled attack dataset is then used for training the cloned model. In data-free model extraction, the attacker does not need to collect the attack dataset and instead generative models can be used to build it, making it convenient for adversaries to run this attack when the input data is hard to find [116]. \n\n17  Figure 9: Model extraction exploiting explanations. Model extraction using explanations is proposed on feature-based and example-based XAI methods. In the seminal work on the topic, gradient explanations, in the form of saliency maps, were found to be vulnerable by Milli et al. [114]. The use of explanations improved the attack by reducing the number of queries in comparison to using model predictions. Miura et al. [116] also leveraged gradient-based explanations but used data-free approach to train generative models for creating the attack dataset. Explanations were found to improve the quality of the generative model, and the accuracy of the cloned model improved with increase in the diversity of the generated attack dataset. The approach of Yan, Hou, et al. [189] was also based on data-free extraction, however the authors used explanation loss to guide the generative model. Accuracy of the cloned model was improved by matching the victim model\u2019s predictions and explanations. A model agnostic extraction technique applicable to both gradient and perturbation-based XAI was proposed by Yan, Huang, et al. [190]. Explanations were found to provide auxiliary information to adversaries, leading to efficient attacks with improved query budgets, compared to those using predictions. The attack could also be applied to non-explanation models and achieved accuracy equivalent to those of explanation models. In another work, Yan et al. [188] used a multitask learning architecture to extract both classification and explanation tasks of the victim model. Besides the above extraction attacks targeting various feature-based XAI, from the example-based category, counterfactuals have been mainly targeted for this attack. In an extraction attack proposed by A\u00efvodji et al. [3], they were used to approximate the decision boundary of the victim model with high accuracy and fidelity under low query budgets. Multiple and diverse counterfactuals were found to aid the extraction process by divulging additional information to adversaries. An improvisation of the attack, to reduce the number of queries further, mitigate decision boundary shift and achieve higher agreement with the victim model, was proposed by Y. Wang et al. [181]. The method used the original counterfactual explanation with its counterfactual as training pairs, to extract additional datapoints to train the cloned model. Kuppa and Le-Khac [92] proposed iterative querying of the victim model to capture the training data distribution and utilization of distillation loss to transfer knowledge from the victim to the cloned model. The attack was found to be successful due to the optimization of various properties such as diversity, proximity, feasibility, and sparsity in the counterfactual method used. The misuse of XAI techniques for cloning models with high accuracy and fidelity, is a threat to the confidentiality of the model owner. The above attacks demonstrate the exploitation of XAI techniques to facilitate extraction of victim models efficiently with reduced number of queries in comparison to extraction attacks based solely on predictions [114, 116]. The reduction in the number of queries to conduct this attack by using explanation interfaces without access to predictions, is a significant gain for attackers, especially in pay-by-query models. Certain attacks are also possible with partial knowledge of the data distribution [3] or even when the attack dataset has no overlap with the training dataset [188]. In addition, in scenarios where attackers do not possess the input datasets, data-free extraction attacks are possible and the use of explanations is shown to have improved accuracy of the attack [116]. The diversity of the generated input datasets in such attacks is also found to improve the accuracy of the cloned models [116]. In addition to the direct threat to explanation models, XAI techniques can be misused for extraction of non-explanation models [190]. The use of diverse explanations, that is useful to build trust of users in the explanations, can lead to further \n\n\n18 leakage of privacy [3]. The optimization of counterfactuals to satisfy various properties to improve explanation quality, can provide more information to adversaries about class-specific decision boundaries thus aiding the attack [92] and leading to the conflict of explainability and privacy with utility. 4.3.4 Property Inference This type of risk reveals properties from the training data such as global statistics or aggregates [106], which model owners did not intend on sharing [61] (Figure 10). The inferred property need not be a feature in the training data or correlated to any feature, for instance, deducing the ratio of different genders in the training set [126] or the aggregate employee sentiments through internal company emails used to train a spam classifier [106]. Thus property inferencing can lead to exposure of sensitive information and constitutes a privacy risk. Though this privacy risk is a known issue in AI models, to the best of our knowledge, no attacks are reported so far using explanations.   Figure 10: Property inference exploiting explanations.

Some leakage can occur due to the natural mechanisms of the training process while some can be caused through the content of explanations. 4.4.1 Training issues  Training issues such as, overfitting and memorization, identified in AI models can lead to privacy leakage. Overfitting occurs when the model performs better on the training data in comparison to test data [80] and is found to aid membership and attribute inference attacks [194]. Memorization refers to the model remembering subsets of training data [156] and occurs during training before overfitting begins [80]. It can cause leakage when data owners deploy models with code written by other parties, such as in MLaaS, allowing sensitive information to be leaked from training data [156]. 4.4.2 Explanation content The content of transparency reports may contain values of sensitive fields. For instance, in example-based explanations such as influence functions, training datapoints potentially containing sensitive fields, are directly revealed to end-users. Karimi et al. [88] provide another example of unintentional leakage through contrastive explanations that can lead to inference of sensitive details of individuals whose partial attributes are known. Interpretable models used as surrogates, can reveal properties of the training data or additional information about the black-box than was intended to share [16]. In addition to this type of direct exposure, the explanation may be exposed to unintended users due to lack of appropriate access control [92]. For example, during troubleshooting of error cases, a developer or quality engineer may inadvertently access sensitive personal information in the explanation. Explanation content containing proxies or correlated fields can also lead to inferring of sensitive fields. 5 PRIVACY PRESERVATION METHODS IN XAI To mitigate the privacy risks discussed in Section 4, many works have highlighted the need for privacy preserving XAI techniques [3, 151, 203]. In response to these calls for increasing safety in explanations by stemming privacy leakage, researchers have begun efforts in exploring algorithms that provide transparency reports in a privacy preserving manner. Many works have leveraged existing techniques from privacy preserving ML (PPML) and have studied their applicability to explanations. In this section, we consolidate the solutions proposed in literature for improvement of XAI methods in response to RQ2. We categorize these solutions under the main approaches in PPML. Table 3 summarizes these approaches and methods, and Figure 11 consolidates the proposed privacy preservation methods for specific privacy attacks. \n\n20  Figure 11: Proposed privacy preservation methods for specific privacy attacks in XAI. 5.1 Differential privacy Differential privacy (DP) [51] is a well-known technique that provides a quantifiable definition of privacy and the incremental privacy loss from publishing confidential data [110]. A mechanism is differentially private if it can hide the participation of any single individual in a dataset [71]. This can be achieved by using noise and is typically associated with an adverse effect on the accuracy of the system [71]. By adjusting the privacy budget, \ud835\udf16, from 0 to \u221e, practitioners can manage this trade-off between privacy and accuracy [110]. Because of its strong privacy guarantee, early works in privacy preserving explanations have adopted DP, using different strategies, to protect the training data in interpretable, feature-based, and example-based XAI. In the context of XAI, an explanation is differentially private if it can obscure any single individual in the training dataset [133] of the model. The technique can be applied on the explanation generation algorithm [133], the training process of the target model [35, 99] or on the training data [21, 55]. Decision trees are popular due to their simplicity and inherent interpretable qualities, however they are prone to privacy leakage [56, 126]. Various algorithms for building decision trees based on DP guarantees are proposed in previous works [58] with different trade-offs in privacy and utility. The interpretability of private trees and hence their usefulness to XAI users, depend on factors such as the privacy budget per query, tree depth, pruning strategies and termination criteria [58]. Nori et al. [131] privatized another type of interpretable model, namely, Explainable Boosting Machines (EBM), using DP for prevention of privacy leakage of training data. The privatized system offered good accuracy at low privacy budgets, allowed rectification of errors introduced by noise, removal of bias and enforcing constraints such as monotonicity. Baek \n\n\n21 and Chung [9] further enhanced the utilization of privacy budget in these models to improve accuracy, by optimization of gradient error and pruning of non-important features. An interpretable model using differentially private locally linear maps with Gaussian mechanism per output class was proposed by Harder et al. [71]. The filters learned by the model from input images were observed to have higher interpretability compared to feature-based methods, such as integrated gradients and SmoothGrad. However, increasing the number of such maps per class dropped accuracy due to the distribution of privacy budget over additional parameters. A different interpretable model, in the form of feedforward-designed convolutional neural network (FF-CNN), was made privacy preserving by D. Li et al. [94] using DP guarantees on subspace approximation with adjusted bias (Saab). The use of DP was found to be effective in mitigating the risk of reconstruction of input images while maintaining classification accuracy. For feature-based explanations generated by local linear approximations around the point of interest, Patel et al. [133] introduced a differentially private approach for loss calculation in the explanation algorithm. The work further proposed an adaptive method of reusing previous explanations for prudent usage of the privacy budget. Nguyen et al. [130] employed local DP to restrict adversaries from learning the top influential features through aggregated scores in feature-based XAI. Though, this was proposed as a solution to a backdoor security attack exploiting explanations [148], the random perturbation of influential features under local DP guarantees, was observed to preserve the privacy of those features while maintaining explanation fidelity. Bozorgpanah and Torra [21] also applied local DP to mask the training dataset and determine its impact on privacy and utility of feature-based explanations. An irregularity metric was defined to measure the feature distortion due to privatization of the original dataset and the change in explanation values. The use of additive noise on the training dataset was observed to introduce irregularities, reducing the utility of the explanations. Ezzeddine et al. [55] added calibrated noise to training datasets and evaluated the impact on SHAP explanations using various distance metrics. The change in SHAP values in the privatized systems was found to be correlated to the privacy budget and data dependent. Abbasi et al. [1] explored the use of DP for generation of synthetic data for training of different types of model architectures and used similarity score to track the change in explanations and utility loss to evaluate drop in accuracy, thus quantifying the triad of privacy, utility and explainability. Besides these works, some researchers have also explored the use of DP in the training process of the target model in feature-based [99] and example-based [35, 117] XAI, with mitigation observed against membership inference for high privacy budgets [35, 99]. DP noise enables the regularization of target models [131] and its mathematical guarantee enables quantification of privacy, making it an attractive privacy enhancing technology. In the context of XAI, in addition to its application in mitigating membership inference from explanations [35, 99, 133], it is also found to mitigate reconstruction of sensitive inputs [94]. However, the improvement in mitigation of attacks at high privacy budgets and hence degrading accuracy [35, 99] can be a setback to the use of this technique. In addition to adversely affecting accuracy, its introduction can also deteriorate explanation quality in terms of fidelity [99, 133]. This impact can be more pronounced for minority groups [133]. The technique is also ineffective against attribute inference attacks when there are existing strong correlations between different attributes [31]. Algorithms such as DPSaab [94], are observed to be better at accuracy and privacy trade-off than others. Strategies such as, reusing previously generated differentially private explanations, can be employed to utilize the privacy budget effectively [133]. Methods using local DP, are observed to achieve good faithfulness of explanations with privacy [130], thus demonstrating that it is possible to balance multiple desirable properties. Hence careful use of this technique is required in a way that privacy can be achieved while retaining reasonable utility of the model and explanations.  \n\n22 5.2 Cryptography Cryptographic protocols for privacy preservation in ML, use secure algorithms to protect the target model and data. Popular methods in this category include homomorphic encryption, secret sharing, and secure multi-party computation [195]. In XAI, this technique has been limitedly explored in interpretable and example-based systems. It has also been used in conjunction with other privacy preserving techniques such as federated learning [53, 119, 186, 187]. For interpretable tree-based models, J. Zhao et al. [202] proposed an additive homomorphic scheme for model owners and query users, to push the encrypted model and query data to cloud service providers for inferencing. Adding perturbations to the inference results and query data ensured privacy protection of these assets while producing accuracy comparable to non-private inference. In the example-based category, Veugen et al. [176] proposed a cryptographic method with secure multi-party computation to generate contrastive explanations, while protecting private training data and confidentiality of the model. The algorithm securely trained a binary decision tree, to generate fact and foil leaves, to create an explanation for a query data point. In addition, a synthetic data point from the foil leaf was provided to the end-user to enhance explainability. Cryptographic methods, such as homomorphic encryption, add to the computational complexity [97] of the system. The use of encryption also makes the model less transparent to data scientists for correction of errors, inspection of data, addition of features or fine tuning of the model [47], thus adversely affecting interpretability. Hence it is essential to implement cryptographic protocols in XAI system components in the right use cases to enhance other privacy preservation techniques or when other techniques are infeasible or costly. 5.3 Anonymization Anonymization is a technique of transformation of data [107] to obscure the distinctive features of records, thus protecting their privacy. The process is associated with the removal or modification of direct and quasi-identifiers [107], that can uniquely identify individuals. Various methods of anonymization exist, such as k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness [195]. In XAI, different anonymization techniques have been proposed in example-based, feature-based, and interpretable methods. The use of techniques such as disentangled representation learning and lossy compression on sensitive images such as medical data, are found to generate privatized explainable-by-design images. A dataset is considered k-anonymous if every record is indistinguishable from k-1 other records [163] thus providing a measure of the risk of re-identification of records. K-anonymity can be achieved using methods such as suppression and generalization [164]. Though traditionally this technique is applied to target datasets for protection, Goethals et al. [64] proposed its usage on native counterfactuals, that are actual datapoints from the training dataset, for protection against model inversion attack through explanations. This strategy of generating k-anonymous counterfactuals was found to have lower information loss and higher validity; outperforming counterfactuals generated from k-anonymized datasets. Berning et al. [13] further analyzed k-anonymous counterfactuals and determined its effectiveness only in dense areas of the dataset. The study found its real privacy level disproportionate to the value of k. According to Vo et al. [177], the generation of k-anonymous counterfactuals requires querying the explainer for a large number of counterfactuals and is computationally expensive. The authors suggest a different strategy of privatizing diverse counterfactuals through discretization of continuous features, a technique which is closely related to generalization in privacy preserving data mining, and effective against linkage attacks. K-anonymity\u2019s application on the complete training dataset for feature-based XAI was implemented by Bozorgpanah and Torra [21] using microaggregation. The study found alignment in the explanations generated from non-private and private datasets, with few irregularities, indicating that utility was preserved after privatization. Blanco-Justicia et al. [16] \n\n23 also applied microaggregation to build local tree-based surrogate explanations from clusters around a point to be explained. K-anonymity was enforced by restricting the cluster size and the usage of shallow trees in the method enabled comprehensibility. A line of work has focused on anonymization of images in the medical domain, where privacy protection of patients\u2019 visual data is crucial. The main objective of such techniques is data transformation through removal of identifying features while retaining explanatory evidence. Strategies such as the use of autoencoders for disentanglement of identifiable and medical characteristics [121] and the use of Siamese network for increasing identity distance between original and privatized images [122] for generating case-based explanations are proposed. Campos et al. [26] proposed the generation of synthetic images using latent diffusion models and removing those similar to training data, thus creating a collection of synthetic images to use as explanations. In addition to these techniques, the use of lossy compression by pixel sampling, is found to remove identification information while being post-hoc explainable and without accessing the original images [62, 85]. The compression also has added advantage of reducing the size of images to a fraction of the original size, thus making medical training datasets smaller [62].  For a critical domain, such as healthcare, anonymizing patients\u2019 images can assist in protecting identifiable data. However, the applied techniques should preserve image quality for utility to medical practitioners and patients [26]. Image anonymization techniques, unlike DP, have unproven guarantees while despite DP\u2019s guarantees, it is unable to scale beyond low resolution images [26]. Lossy compression provides a fast and effective way of privatizing images, with the benefits of achieving privacy and explainability while reducing training dataset sizes and enabling data sharing with multiple parties in non-private settings [62]. Thus, this method can be explored as a suitable alternative for generating explanations from sensitive image data. Anonymization techniques protect privacy of individuals by preventing re-identification and linkage attacks [177]. When using k-anonymity, the choice of k that gives both accuracy and acceptable privacy risk level is critical [21]. Higher values of k yield higher privacy but explainability may be adversely affected [13, 16]. The real level of privacy may also not scale with increasing values of k [13]. Hence the choice of k that gives the right balance of privacy, explainability and utility is important. In addition, k-anonymity has downsides, such as its dependence on data characteristics, susceptibility to homogeneity attack [13], and its vulnerability to privacy leakage when background knowledge is available or diversity is lacking in the private attributes [64]. Other techniques such as l-diversity and t-closeness may overcome these challenges but are yet to be explored with explanations. The generation of synthetic data for privacy preserving data analysis is explored in previous non-XAI works [20, 98]. Generating synthetic data that is private, accurate and preserves properties of the true data is a known challenge and NP-hard in the worst case [174]. When models are trained on such data, the explanations through XAI tools are expected to be inherently privacy preserving, hence this can also be a promising future approach to safeguarding privacy in explainable systems. 5.4 Perturbation Perturbation of sensitive data is a well-known technique in privacy preserving data publishing [171, 195]. When explanations contain sensitive information, obfuscating the contents can prevent direct exposure. Perturbation techniques can also be applied to stem indirect leakage from inferencing of sensitive attributes through explanations. C.-L. Chen et al. [31] proposed a generic privacy preserving mechanism applicable to different XAI types such as feature-based and interpretable surrogates. The proposed method perturbed the decision mapping of an algorithm prior to public release of transparency reports. To control privacy leakage while upholding utility, the authors defined a maximum \n\n24 confidence measure in the inference of sensitive attributes of data subjects and a utility measure in terms of faithfulness or fidelity. Jeong et al. [81] proposed a defense framework against black-box model inversion attacks on saliency map explanations from image models. The framework comprised of two-player minimax game between inversion and noise injector networks, in which the inversion network attempts to reconstruct images from saliency maps and the noise injector perturbs explanations to counter the inversion. The use of multiple evaluation metrics to differentiate between the original and reconstructed images, was used to quantify the privacy of the defense mechanism. For prevention of privacy leakage in XAI, researchers have attempted perturbation of two types of model outputs, namely, predictions and explanations. Adding perturbations to model predictions, such as the strategy of adding noise to output confidence scores used by MemGuard [82], is found ineffective in mitigating membership inference through explanations [99]. Perturbation of explanations is also found insufficient in defending against data-free model extraction based on explanations [189]. However, the strategy has shown promising results in countering model inversion. The use of perturbation techniques at the explanation interface is attractive due to its ease of implementation, requiring no retraining of the model [81]. However, because the addition of large magnitude noise can degrade the usefulness of explanations [81], perturbations should be carefully calibrated to minimize any adverse impact on explanation quality. 5.5 Federated Learning Among the privacy enhancing techniques available in PPML, Federated learning (FL) is an architectural solution [52] that enables training of local models on user devices and exchange of model parameters with a centralized server that co-ordinates the training of a shared global model [91]. It thus enables collaborative learning while keeping users\u2019 private data at the source [66] and mitigates the privacy risk of multiple parties sharing their sensitive data with other parties [53] or a centralized server [204]. In horizontal federated learning (HFL), local datasets have the same feature space but different samples while in vertical federated learning (VFL), the feature space is different but there are overlaps in samples [57]. To provide both privacy and explainability in Trustworthy AI, the combination of FL and XAI, i.e., Fed-XAI is suggested [11, 36, 100] and refers to the federated learning of XAI models. Many approaches of Fed-XAI using HFL and VFL are proposed in literature. Fiosina [57] used a HFL approach for forecasting taxi trip duration and applied feature-based explainability methods post-hoc. P. Chen et al. [32] used an explainable VFL framework to optimize counterfactual explanations using a representative query distributed on multiple parties. Both setups demonstrate the use of post-hoc explainability tools in a distributed environment, with FL serving as a privacy preserving setup for collaborative learning of sensitive data owned by multiple parties. Fed-XAI architectures have also leveraged interpretable models locally, such as fuzzy rule-based classifiers [39], Takagi-Sugeno [204] and Takagi-Sugeno-Kang [36] fuzzy rule-based models. In these setups, interpretability is achieved using underlying explainable-by-design [36] models. Though FL aids privacy by default, it is prone to reconstruction and inferencing attacks [123, 199]. The sharing of gradients and model parameters, communication mechanism and aggregation process can lead to leakage of privacy of the participating clients [199]. Hence researchers have proposed integration of other privacy preserving techniques, such as cryptography, with FL methods. In one such work, Molhoek and Laanen [119] generated synthetic data on vertically partitioned data in a FL two-party setup. Counterfactuals built from this synthetic data using secure multi-party computation, were ranked, and shared with both parties and were found to be resilient to attribute inference. El Zein et al. [53] proposed a HFL structure using decision tree models, wherein a global decision tree was collaboratively trained by participants and aggregation of intermediate results used additive secret-sharing. A VFL technique, Falcon [187], utilized a hybrid approach consisting of partially homomorphic encryption (PHE) and additive secret sharing for exchange of intermediate computations. It used logistic/linear regression and multi-layer perceptron as local models. Another setup, \n\n25 Pivot [186], proposed as part of Falcon, used classification and regression tree-based models. Threshold partially homomorphic encryption (TPHE) and additive secret sharing was used to protect privacy of intermediate exchanges. Though these works successfully integrate cryptographic techniques with FL, research has also found that the use of these methods in FL makes it difficult for the centralized server to differentiate the true model parameters, and this can lead to backdoor attacks by adversaries [69]. Hence appropriate defense frameworks, such as trust evaluation schemes [70], should be incorporated for protection of the FL system from malicious users. FL enables the training of AI models from diverse, private, and high-quality data [204] located at client systems. It reduces the footprint of user data in the network [123] by keeping data at the source and avoiding transmission and storage of sensitive information in a centralized location when multiple parties are involved [179]. Despite its benefits, in its current form FL faces challenges for its risk-free adoption [123] including ensuring privacy constraints, merging of local XAI models and dealing with large data streaming that can lead to concept drifts [11]. The introduction of XAI methods in the FL architecture, can also further increase the vulnerability of the system to privacy attacks through explanations. Thus Fed-XAI presently cannot guarantee privacy preservation through XAI components and further research efforts in this area is necessary to stem inadvertent privacy leakage through explanations. 5.6 Other techniques In addition to the main privacy preservation methods from PPML, certain non-standard techniques are also explored in certain types of XAI. Some of these methods include limiting access to training data, obscuring features, or providing an abstraction of the target models. A client-centric, data-driven approach of generating counterfactuals was proposed by An and Cao [6] by leveraging previous inferences retrieved by the model user. Due to the generation of counterfactuals locally at the client, the method was shown to be resilient to model extraction while achieving properties such as diversity and succinctness. Marton et al. [108] described a data-free approach of distilling the function represented by neural networks into interpretable models. The method used synthetic data to train a set of neural networks and extracted their parameters to train an Interpretation-Net with an output representation in the form of surrogate decision trees. Using a knowledge-based approach, Ro\u017eanec et al. [143] applied semantic technologies in the form of domain specific ontology and knowledge graphs, to enhance explanations and describe features on a higher conceptual level. This enabled delinking explanations from features, thus preserving the confidentiality of the underlying model. Further, the integration of feature-based XAI such as LIME, enabled the system to determine features important for predictions. Terziyan and Vitko [167] described an approach to build semantic XAI consisting of decision trees and rules generated from targeted points around the decision boundary of black-box models, without accessing the original training data. Due to the interoperability of semantic rules, the method could be used in a decentralized setup for collaborative decision making, without individual parties sharing private local data. The above works demonstrate the use of data-free and knowledge-driven techniques of XAI to build privacy- by-design systems. These approaches are applicable for protection of training data and the confidentiality of the model. The approach of disconnecting features from the model, enables the creation of an abstraction layer [143] for generation of explanations, thus protecting the underlying assets.  \n\n26 Table 3: Privacy preserving methods applied to XAI systems.

We have also reviewed applicable privacy preserving methods to protect the additional attack surface that explanations expose, in addition to the existing privacy related vulnerabilities in AI systems. In this section, based on the answers to RQ1 and RQ2, we attempt to answer RQ3 and identify desirable characteristics in XAI for mitigation of the identified risks. These characteristics shed light on the properties of privacy preserving XAI by considering the vulnerable assets that need protection and the users involved during the AI lifecycle. The characteristics intend to provide researchers and practitioners, a checklist for validation of existing privacy preserving XAI methods to aid in the design of new methods that target privacy by default. By reflecting these qualities, XAI can aspire to achieve the triad of privacy, explainability and utility. We explain the characteristics (Figure 12) by considering three use cases outlined in Table 4. To facilitate understanding, a simplified example of an online loan application system that makes automated decisions using an AI model with XAI capabilities, is considered. The system uses 7 input features with salary, net worth, and age, being protected features that require privacy preservation. The use cases describe the following scenarios: \u2022 Use Case 1 deals with intentional privacy leakage through an adversary. \u2022 Use Case 2 involves interaction of a layman end-user, i.e., a bank\u2019s customer, who is provided an explanation of an automated decision directly through the system and indirectly through a human. Let\u2019s assume that in this use case, the loan was denied because of the applicant salary being < 40K and age > 50 years. \n\n28 \u2022 Use Case 3 considers the interaction of technical support, in the roles of AI developer and quality engineer, with the XAI system. Table 4: Use cases for privacy preserving XAI in an online loan application system. Property Details System Online loan application system Model owner Bank Model input features salary, net worth, age, length of credit history, occupation, working hours per week, education Sensitive features salary, net worth, age Use Case 1 Adversary with black-box access to the system. Actors Adversary Overview An adversary secures black-box access to the bank\u2019s model through the online application system. The adversary attempts different queries and observes the outputs generated by the system. Query data (i) randomly generated queries. (ii) targeted queries using prior information. Use Case 2 Customer accessing explanation of the application outcome. Actors Customer, bank executive Overview A customer submits an online application for a loan and is given a denied result. The customer is provided with: (i) an automated explanation. (ii) a consultation with a bank executive to discuss the result. Query data salary = $35K, net worth = $75K, age = 55 years, length of credit history = 30 years, occupation = office executive, working hours per week = 25, education = diploma. Use Case 3 AI developer accessing explanation for troubleshooting a reported error case and a quality engineer subsequently validating the system updates. Actors AI developer, quality engineer Overview An error is reported on a specific query and a developer updates the model during debugging. The developer accesses the explanation of the error case to verify the results. Finally, a tester validates the system updates with another round of testing. Query data Synthetic query similar to the error case requiring troubleshooting.  We propose 10 characteristics that XAI should demonstrate. The first 6 are derived from privacy attacks and unintentional leakage reviewed in Section 4. The remaining 4 are derived from performance issues and regulatory compliance. The proposed characteristics are as follows: 6.1.1 Prevent training data identification: XAI tools should not aid identification of individuals used in training the model. In Use Case 1, if the adversary has access to a specific individual\u2019s input details and retrieves the corresponding outputs including the outcome and explanations, no additional advantage should be provided through explanations in determining if the individual was used in training the bank\u2019s model. Thus, the explanations should be resilient to membership inference (Section 4.3.1). 6.1.2 Prevent sensitive data inference: XAI tools should not aid reconstruction or inference of sensitive attributes of individuals. In Use Case 1, if the adversary knows the non-sensitive features of an individual and the outcome of the loan application but is unaware of any sensitive feature such as salary or age, the explanations provided should not aid in inferring these sensitive features of the individual. Thus, the explanations should be resilient to model inversion (Section 4.3.2). \n\n29 6.1.3 Prevent reverse engineering of model: XAI tools should not aid in reverse engineering the model functionalities. In Use Case 1, the adversary, by querying the bank\u2019s model and by inspecting the explanations, should be unable to build a surrogate of the original model. Thus, the explanations should be resilient to model extraction (Section 4.3.3). 6.1.4 Prevent property inference: XAI tools should not aid the inferencing of aggregate properties of the training data. In Use Case 1, by using targeted queries on the bank\u2019s model, the adversary should be unable to exploit explanations in determining group properties such as the ratio of old and young participants in the training data or the ratio of wealthy and average income training participants. Thus, the explanations should be resilient to property inference (Section 4.3.4). 6.1.5 Prevent direct exposure: Explanations generated by XAI tools should not reveal personally identifiable and/or sensitive information to unauthorized individuals [31]. Certain explanation types, such as influence functions or native counterfactuals, reveal actual datapoints leading to direct exposure [13, 150, 151]. In Use Case 2, when the customer seeks an explanation on his/her application outcome, the explanation could indicate the failure to meet respective thresholds of $40K for salary and 50 years for age. Revealing the actual values of the protected features, would breach the privacy of the customer when it is accessed by other actors, such as the bank executive during the customer\u2019s consultation. The customer may, however, subsequently provide consent to the executive to retrieve their personal and financial details from the bank\u2019s records for the consultation. 6.1.6 Prevent indirect exposure: The content of the provided explanations should not indirectly expose personally identifiable and/or sensitive information through correlated or proxy features to unauthorized individuals. In Use Case 2, if the explanation reveals the length of credit history, which is a non-sensitive attribute, to actors other than the customer, it can lead to breach of a sensitive attribute, i.e., age, due to the close correlation between the two attributes. 6.1.7 Access control of explanations: The content of explanations should be accessed only by authorized users [16, 92]. The included details may vary from user to user on need-to-know basis. In Use Case 2, the customer is authorized to access his/her own explanation. The bank executive should be authorized to access the explanation only if a human intermediary is required to enhance the process of explanation for the customer. In Use Case 3, the AI developer and quality engineer should be permitted to access explanations and outcomes for synthetic queries generated to simulate specific error cases without accessing those for real production data. 6.1.8 Upholding of explanation quality: The quality of explanations should not deteriorate by introduction of privacy preservation measures. Explanations are required to be useful [151] to target stakeholders. In Use Cases 2 and 3, the details contained in the explanations to respective users should assist them in completing their tasks effectively and/or help them interpret the outcome of an AI system. \n\n30 6.1.9 Acceptable run time: The run time of XAI methods, being an important evaluation metric [19], should not deteriorate by introduction of privacy preservation measures. In Use Cases 2 and 3, the explanation recipients should see the outputs within an acceptable timeframe. A long turnaround time may lead to the explanations becoming ineffective for the task at hand. 6.1.10 Compliance with applicable AI/privacy regulations: XAI being an AI system, should comply with applicable AI and privacy regulations in respective jurisdictions. For instance, if the XAI is deployed in Canada with Canadian residents as the target users, it is expected to comply with the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act [2]. Users should be informed of the XAI capabilities of the system including the type and content of explanations and the parties with whom the explanations will be shared. Appropriate consent should be taken as required.  \n Figure 12: Proposed privacy preserving XAI characteristics. 7 DISCUSSION In this section, we summarize the results of our work, its implications, the open issues, and challenges in the field. We also make recommendations for future research. 7.1 Summary, results, and implications The review of existing literature enabled us to synthesize knowledge on the conflict between privacy and explainability, both being important pillars of Trustworthy AI. The extracted studies demonstrate that additional information provided in the form of explanations can be an advantage to adversaries to launch privacy attacks in XAI. We have categorized certain types of privacy leakage due to malicious intent of adversaries as intentional causes. These are in the form of membership inference, model inversion and model extraction, demonstrated on explanations generated using different methods. These \n\n\n31 attacks pose a threat to the privacy of individuals contained in the training set, making them vulnerable to identification or exposure of their sensitive information. In addition, due to data reconstruction, individuals whose data is used to query the model [202, 203] during inferencing become susceptible to exposure of sensitive information, thus affecting the active users of an XAI system. The threat of model extraction through explanations, targets the confidentiality and intellectual property of the model owner. Property inference can enable determination of sensitive aggregates or group properties of the training data. However, no property inference attacks are found on XAI systems from the reviewed studies. In addition to privacy attacks, ML models have inherent privacy issues such as memorization of training data or overfitting leading to various inferencing attacks. These privacy problems are inherited in XAI systems, and we have categorized them as unintentional causes. In addition to this type of leakage due to training issues, the explanation content can be at direct threat of privacy breaches by unauthorized users due to lack of access control, or through proxies and correlated fields. Due to the imminent privacy risks of explainability, researchers have started exploring defense mechanisms for privacy preservation with explanations. This review determined that methods such as DP and anonymization are widely explored in this context, deducing from the number of studies that have used these methods. Fewer studies have used knowledge integration, cryptography, or perturbation as strategies for privacy preservation. Hence there is scope to utilize these underexplored techniques to achieve privacy in XAI systems. In distributed environment, Fed-XAI attempts to achieve explainability while preserving privacy of local data, but in its current form it cannot guarantee privacy with XAI, and explanations may provide a backdoor to malicious attacks. Besides, the integration of cryptographic techniques into Fed-XAI can further impact the security of the system [69]. The study of privacy risks and preservation methods in XAI led us to determine characteristics that privacy preserving explanations should reflect. In addition to being resilient to privacy attacks and prevention of direct and indirect exposure of sensitive information, explanations should satisfy performance and utility constraints. Since explanations can contain potentially identifiable data and may be subject to regulations, they are required to comply with the applicable laws within the jurisdiction. This article thus identifies and highlights a significant gap in the research of methods within the field of XAI, i.e., explainability methods should be designed considering privacy as a system requirement. The findings of this paper can be utilized as follows: \u2022 Researchers can use the information to explore state-of-the-art privacy attacks, preservation methods and research related to privacy and explainability. \u2022 Practitioners can leverage these insights to enhance their understanding of the privacy risks associated with XAI and identify potential solutions to mitigate those risks across various XAI methods. 7.2 Open issues, challenges, and recommendations for future work Based on the privacy risks and countermeasures surveyed, we have identified the following open issues and challenges. We also recommend potential directions for future work in this area. 7.2.1 Improving usability of XAI methods End-users are an important component of XAI and directly consume the content generated by the system. Current XAI methods are essentially model-centric and useful for model development and audit [87]. However, the methods should steer towards a user-centric approach to provide need-to-know information to end-users depending on their role in the overall system. Explanations should be provided by integrating user-centric design principles in a privacy preserving manner, in a format suitable for users\u2019 consumption to cater to their diverse needs [4, 87]. Appropriate tools, such as interactivity and visualization, should be employed to enhance the process of explanation and deepen users\u2019 understanding \n\n32 [18]. The use of the 3C-principle of context, content, and consent [24] for creating effective privacy explanations can be utilized for improving usability of XAI tools. 7.2.2 Development of privacy metrics for XAI Privacy is a vital desideratum to ensure the safety of XAI but currently there is a lack of suitable metrics to measure the level of privacy of explanations. Current XAI literature provides evaluation metrics such as sufficiency [40], consistency [40] and sensitivity [193] to evaluate aspects such as faithfulness and robustness [72], but a metric for quantitative evaluation of privacy is lacking. To quantify the privacy of an explainability algorithm, a privacy metric is desirable. 7.2.3 Balancing tradeoff in privacy, explainability and accuracy An adverse effect on accuracy is generally observed when privacy enhancement technologies are introduced [55, 71] in an AI system. For instance, perturbation of classifier weights of support vector machines has adverse impact on the classification accuracy and credibility of counterfactuals [117]. The use of differential privacy in neural network models is found to lower its accuracy and hence its utility [17]. Its introduction into the training process of models is also found to lower explanation quality [99]. Similarly, the use of generalization techniques for anonymization are found to reduce the quality of explanations [13]. Explainability integrated through XAI techniques in non-interpretable models can be evaluated with quantitative metrics such as faithfulness, robustness, stability and run time [19]. Determining the appropriate tradeoff between privacy, explainability and accuracy is crucial for the successful application of XAI. The use of compatibility matrix [1] or hyperparameters, for instance, the privacy budget \ud835\udf16 in differential privacy, is useful in tuning the desired level of these properties. Similar tuning mechanisms should be made available in other privacy preserving approaches to achieve the required tradeoff. Metrics, such as trade-off score [1], can enable to quantify the balance of these properties. 7.2.4 Examining and improving tradeoff in different privacy preserving methods for XAI Different privacy preservation methods applicable to XAI are discussed in Section 5. An examination of the privacy-utility-explainability tradeoff of these methods will help to identify those that are more effective compared to others. It will also help to identify their shortcomings so that novel or hybrid methods can be developed. Apart from differential privacy and anonymization, which have been mainly explored in XAI systems, other underexplored techniques such as use of knowledge integration and cryptographic protocols should be examined and compared. Distributed privacy enhancing solutions, such as Fed-XAI, should be further investigated to determine strategies to stem the possible leakages from XAI components. 7.2.5 Development of XAI methods that are privacy preserving by design According to Hoepman [75], privacy is a core property of computer systems and needs addressing from system design phase rather than treated as an add-on. The proposed characteristics of privacy preserving XAI, can aid researchers and developers in building algorithms that are privacy enhanced by design [21]. Recently there is growing interest in neuro-symbolic approaches [74] and semantic technologies [147], and they can be explored for their usage as explainable-by-design models. \n\n33 7.2.6 Privacy preserving XAI for Gen-AI and LLMs XAI research has mainly focused on discriminative models that produce decision boundaries, and limited work has been done on developing explainability methods for Gen-AI and LLMs [146, 160, 183]. Due to the complex structure and vast number of parameters in these models, traditional explainability methods become impractical to them [201]. Currently these models have privacy issues, such as memorization of training data, that can enable the extraction of sensitive information which escalates as the models become larger [29]. In addition, the downstream private dataset used for in-context learning in LLMs is found to be susceptible to membership inference [48]. Methods such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) are currently being explored to counter some of the challenges, which enables the fine tuning of outputs by augmenting external data sources and can potentially mitigate leakage of memorized training data [197]. XAI is a vital desideratum for trustworthiness [180] and ethical applications of these models [102] but the introduction of explainability should not exacerbate the inherent privacy issues or create new vulnerabilities. A privacy analysis of novel applicable methods in the early stages of development and auditing using existing attacks [29], will boost the development of privacy-enhanced systems. Thus, with the current popularity of Gen-AI and LLMs for the masses, developing appropriate user-centric privacy preserving explainability techniques specifically for these systems is an important avenue for further research. 7.2.7 Evaluation of privacy preserving XAI characteristics The proposed characteristics of privacy preserving XAI (Section 6) describe the desirable qualities of XAI that protect privacy while producing useful explanations to the target users. In future, we will work on the evaluation of XAI methods on the proposed characteristics. We will also enhance XAI methods so that the generated explanations satisfy the characteristics. We aim to improve the applicability of the characteristics through the evaluation of XAI methods.  7.2.8 Comparative study of privacy risks of different XAI categories Existing XAI methods are found to belong to different categories such as interpretable, example-based, knowledge-based, and feature-based (Section 2.3). Each category is found to have its own unique challenges such as interpretable models are transparent but suffer low accuracy compared to complex black-box models [16, 53, 68]. Example-based methods that use instances as explanations, such as influence functions and native counterfactuals, cause direct exposure of training data [151, 176]. Among feature-based methods, backpropagation are found to be more susceptible to privacy risks compared to perturbation-based [151]. The privacy risks of different approaches should be comparatively studied to determine approaches that are more resilient to risks compared to others. Knowledge-based methods have the capacity of segregating features from explanations which may be helpful in safeguarding the privacy of training data and model confidentiality. An analysis of the privacy risks of different approaches will help to determine the suitable approach that new methods should adopt. 8 CONCLUSION XAI is an active field of research and a crucial pillar of Trustworthy AI. It aims to bring logical explanations, a fundamental property of all computer systems, to black-box AI models. Explainability of models is essential to secure user trust in automated outcomes, especially in critical domains where such outcomes have high impact on the lives of individuals. Though explainability has emerged as a gold standard for Trustworthy AI, previous works have highlighted potential privacy risks of introducing transparency to black boxes. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of detailed review on the tension between privacy and explainability. In this article, we have focused on this gap and conducted a scoping \n\n34 review to elicit details on the privacy risks posed by XAI and the corresponding solutions for privacy preservation in XAI. Our review draws attention to the intentional and unintentional misuse of explanation interfaces and the pressing need for developing XAI that is privacy preserving. In addition to reviewing the privacy risks and the progress achieved by researchers in achieving privacy improvement in XAI systems, we propose the characteristics of privacy preserving XAI, to assist AI engineers and researchers in understanding the requirements of XAI that achieves privacy with utility. We base these characteristics on the identified risks, the encountered performance issues, and the expected regulatory compliance. The characteristics can be utilized for designing new explainability methods and for evaluation of existing methods. Finally, we conclude the article by identifying the open issues and challenges in the field and provide recommendations for future work. Among the directions identified, developing privacy metrics, creating privacy preserving explanations for generative models and balancing the tradeoff of privacy, utility and explainability in existing and new XAI methods, will determine its success as a foundation pillar of Trustworthy AI.

Introduction\nComputer vision (CV) has emerged as a powerful tool in\necology and biology, with the potential to dramatically re-\nduce the effort required for data extraction [ 50]. These ad-\nvantages have important implications for many disciplines ,\nincluding biodiversity monitoring [ 47], conservation [ 50],\nbehavioural ecology [ 13], neurobiology [ 38] and more.\nIn recent years, there has been signi\ufb01cant development\nof datasets and algorithms [ 4,5,9,18,28,32,36,37,40\u2013\n42,46,52] for animal studies. While these algorithms are\nrigorously evaluated using machine learning (ML) metrics\n(e.g., accuracy, mean average precision (mAP), root mean\nsquared error (RMSE)), their impact on ecological and bi-\nological research remains largely underexplored. Only a\nsmall number of studies have examined how CV solutions\ntranslate to real-world applications and their effectiven ess\nin deriving meaningful measurements in downstream anal-\nysis [ 8,11,20,41,44,47,53]. However, the emergence of\napplication-driven ML learning [ 49] and its adoption by ma-\njor conferences [ 12,24,43] is beginning to bridge this gap\nand it is a timely opportunity to evaluate the practical us-\nability of ML models in their intended applications.\nIn this paper, we argue models should be evaluated using\napplication-speci\ufb01c metrics that re\ufb02ect effectiveness in their\nintended ecological or biological use cases, in addition to\nstandard ML metrics. To support this argument, we present\ntwo case studies with both methods of evaluation. First,\nwe evaluate a behaviour classi\ufb01cation model for removing\nvideo segments containing behaviours known to bias pop-\nulation abundance estimates calculated using camera trap\ndistance sampling (CTDS). We demonstrate that; (a) high-\nperforming ML models (e.g., 87% mAP) can output data\nthat, when used in CTDS, produce abundance estimates that\ndiffer signi\ufb01cantly from those obtained through manual ex-\npert annotation and; (b) the way model predictions interact\nwith statistical approaches, such as CTDS, is dif\ufb01cult to pr e-\ndict. Second, we employ 3D posture estimation algorithms\nto infer attention in pigeons by estimating head rotation. W e\n\ufb01nd that; (c) there is a mismatch between the accuracy of\nkeypoint estimation with rotation estimation, and; (d) mis -\nmatches can result in misleading conclusions about which\nmodel is the most appropriate for the \ufb01nal application.\nTo better align models with their intended use case, we\nrecommend that application-speci\ufb01c metrics are included\nin existing/future datasets and reported on when propos-\ning new models, as complementary metrics to existing ML\nbenchmarks. Building on recent calls for closer interdis-\nciplinary collaboration [ 47,50], we highlight application-\nspeci\ufb01c metrics as a practical and accessible starting poin t\nfor joint efforts between ML and ecology/biology re-searchers that stands to bene\ufb01t both \ufb01elds.\n2. Related Work\nAs early as 2012, Wagstaff [ 51] highlighted over-\nreliance on benchmark datasets, lack of method interpre-\ntatability, and limited capacity for real-world applicati on in\nthe \ufb01eld of machine learning. More recent commentaries\nhave highlighted limitations with the current benchmark-\ning system [ 35], and need for alternative evaluation pro-\ncedures [ 48]. Recently, Rolnick et al. [ 49] formulated a\nparadigm to separate ML research into methods-driven ML\nand application-driven ML. The latter is intended to over-\ncome the aforementioned limitations by promoting closer\ncollaboration with end users, conservative use of standard -\nized datasets, and evaluation metrics tailored to speci\ufb01c d o-\nmains. In biological and ecological studies, there is in-\ncreasing interest in evaluating ML models in an application -\nspeci\ufb01c context [ 8,11,20,23,29,41,44,47,53].\nEcology . Whytock et al. [ 53] trained the ResNet50 ar-\nchitecture to classify 26 Central African mammal and bird\nspecies with a top-1 accuracy of 77.63% and showed that\npredictions were equivalent to expert labelling when con-\nsidering species richness, occupancy and activity pattern s.\nPantazis et al. [ 45] assess the impact of model architecture,\nlabel noise, and dataset size on the same ecological met-\nrics, showing that model architecture is of minimal impor-\ntance although noise and dataset size is signi\ufb01cant. Hen-\nrich et al. [ 20] perform semi-automatic extraction of dis-\ntances between animal and camera with a deep learning\nmodel and predict population densities for 10 species us-\ning CTDS. They show densities predicted with manual and\nsemi-automatic processes do not differ signi\ufb01cantly.\nBiology . Chistensen et al. [ 11] highlight that ML met-\nrics (F1-score) of a behavioral classi\ufb01er from accelerome-\nter data can be misleading, and even low accuracy can lead\nto a reliable inference of behavioural states in wild birds.\nBenchmarking results from the BuckTales dataset [ 41] sug-\ngest that commonly used MOT metric, MOTA, is not suit-\nable to evaluate animal tracking algorithms, as it does not\nconsider ID switches, which is highly relevant for biologi-\ncal analysis. Recent studies have also evaluated ML-based\npipelines by their ability to predict simple biological hy-\npotheses in animal behaviour [ 8,11], or detect differences\nin medical treatment groups, e.g [ 23,29]. Speci\ufb01cally for\nanimal posture estimation, to the best of our knowledge,\nthere is limited work evaluating the relationship between\nthe accuracy of keypoint estimation models and down-\nstream applications, despite the widespread application o f\nthe method.\n2\n\n3. Case study 1: Abundance & Density Estima-\ntion of Chimpanzees\nOverview . CTDS is a common approach to estimating\nthe abundance of a species through camera trapping [ 16,\n17,21,22]. It measures distances from cameras to detected\nanimals and models detection probability as a function of\ndistance to estimate population abundance and density. At\nits core, it is a detection function, which describes how the\nprobability of detecting an animal decreases with increas-\ning distance from the camera. The data required by CTDS\nis dif\ufb01cult to obtain, necessitating the annotation of intr a-\nvideo animal identities, species, distances from the cam-\nera at regular time intervals, and behaviour in camera trap\nvideos.\nIn this case study, we automate one stage of the data\nacquisition pipeline: behaviour recognition. Camera reac -\ntivity behaviour is known to bias abundance estimates by\ncausing chimps to remain in (i.e., attraction) or out (i.e.,\navoidance) of the cameras view, which can lead to over-\nestimation and underestimation of population abundances,\nrespectively [ 17,21]. Identifying and removing video clips\nwhere camera reactivity is observed currently represents t he\nmost effective method to debias estimates [ 17]. Below, we\ndescribe the training and evaluation of a behaviour recogni -\ntion model, and evaluate its ability to identify clips in whi ch\nchimpanzees exhibit camera reactivity and the effect of us-\ning it on abundance estimates.\n3.1. Experimental Setup\nModel Implementation & Training . We train Uni-\nformerV2 [ 34] on a modi\ufb01ed version of the PanAf20k\ndataset [ 6] to classify camera reactivity (i.e., presence or\nabsence of reaction) of chimpanzees in camera trap videos.\nTo achieve this, we convert the labels of the dataset into a\nbinary format: videos annotated with camera reactivity are\nassigned a positive label, while those without are assigned\na negative label. We follow the training protocol detailed\nin [6], except we use a class balanced focal loss [ 14] to mit-\nigate the effect of class imbalance (a 70:30 class imbalance\nbetween non-reactive and reactive videos exists). Macro-\naveraged mean average precision (mAP) is used for model\nevaluation.\nAbundance Estimation & Model Evaluation . To eval-\nuate impact on downstream abundance estimates a differ-\nent dataset comprising 413 videos from the Ta\u00ef National\nPark, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, is used. Each video is manually an-\nnotated with all the information required to generate abun-\ndance estimates using CTDS [ 21]. The calculations are per-\nformed following the approach outlined by Howe et al. [ 22].\nThe trained model is applied over 2 second segments of\nall videos (i.e., the same time intervals used during man-\nual annotation), and clips classi\ufb01ed as containing camera\nreactivity are removed prior to CTDS. Note that inferenceis performed in an out-of-distribution (OOD) setting since\nthe camera trap locations here are unseen during training.\n3.2. Results\nFirst, the performance of the behaviour recognition\nmodel is reported, as evaluated using typical ML metrics\n(mAP). Then, the abundance estimates produced using the\nmodel \ufb01ltered video footage are compared with those cal-\nculated using expert annotation and removal. Results are\nreported for two different detection functions: half-norm al\n(Hn1) and hazard rate (Hr1). Hn1 assumes a smooth decline\nin detection, while Hr1 allows for a \ufb02at detection zone fol-\nlowed by a steep drop. Note that all other data required\nfor distance sampling (i.e., intra-video individual ident i-\nties, species, distance from camera to individual etc.) are\nproduced expertly. Thus, only the effect of automated be-\nhaviour classi\ufb01cation on CTDS is examined.\nResult 1: Behaviour Recognition Performance . The\nmodel achieves an mAP score of 87.82%, although there is\na noticeable discrepancy in class-wise performance. While\nit effectively detects the absence of camera reactivity wit h\n95.31% AP, performance on detecting presence is lower at\n73.95%. This discrepancy highlights the signi\ufb01cance of\nclass imbalance even when imbalances are not extreme.\nResult 2: Abundance & Density Estimation . If camera\nreactivity clips are not removed prior to CTDS then popula-\ntion abundance and densities are signi\ufb01cantly overestimated\n(Tab. 1; 2575 vs. 1680 and 2529 vs. 1954 for Hr1 and Hn1,\nrespectively). Across both detection functions, estimate s\nare highest when no removal of camera reactivity clips is\nperformed (row 1 and 4 vs. rest). Tab. 1also shows that\nusing the behaviour classi\ufb01er to remove camera reactivity\nclips still results in over estimation of abundance/densit y,\nacross both detection functions. However, the degree of\nabundance overestimation is far greater in Hr1 (+20.77%)\nthan Hn1 (+14.38%). Density is also overestimated but\nthere is relatively little difference in the increase betwe en\ndetection functions. This difference shows that even when\nthesame model predictions are used to remove clips, the\nresulting abundance estimates can vary depending on the\nchoice of detection function. This highlights that it is not\njust the number of correctly classi\ufb01ed segments that matter s\n\u2014 but which segments are correctly identi\ufb01ed and removed.\n4. Case study 2: Gaze Estimation in Pigeons\nOverview. Vision is a primary sensory channel for many\nspecies, and the direction of attention\u2014where an animal\ndirects its eyes or head (gaze)\u2014provides crucial insights\ninto how animals acquire information about their environ-\nments. In this case study, we evaluate markerless 3D pos-\nture estimation methods by comparing their absolute Eu-\nclidean position errors with angular head orientation er-\nrors, the latter being a more meaningful measure for assess-\ning the accuracy of inferred gaze direction.

Bold denotes best model for given metric.\nmans, many bird species have foveas\u2014specialized regions\nin the eye where visual acuity is highest [ 2]. Recent stud-\nies have shown that by measuring a bird\u2019s 3D head rotation,\nresearchers can infer its gaze direction using both marker-\nbased [ 15,26,30,39]and markerless motion capture systems\n[10,40]. When combined with simple behavioral experi-\nments that estimate the location and extent of the bird\u2019s vi-\nsual \ufb01eld during object-directed attention, head orientat ion\ncan serve as a reliable proxy for gaze direction [ 7,30,31].\n4.1. Experimental setup\nDataset & Evaluation Metrics. Here, we use the 3D-\nPOP dataset [ 40], a large scale 2D to 3D posture dataset in\npigeon \ufb02ocks, to reproduce benchmarks introduced in the\n3D-MuPPET framework [ 52] for 3D posture estimation. In\n3D-MuPPET, the authors provide benchmark results. We\nrefer to original publication for implementation details [ 52].\nin terms of RMSE and percentage correct keypoints (PCK).\nRMSE is calculated by taking the root mean squared of the\nEuclidean distances between all predicted and ground truth\nkeypoints, while PCK is the percentage of predicted key-\npoints that fall within 5% or 10% of the maximum length\nof any two ground truth 3D keypoints [ 52]. In the current\nstudy, we only report these metrics for four head keypoints\n- not the nine keypoints reported in [ 52], so the comparison\nis fair with the alternative metric we propose below.\nWe propose an alternative metric that is more aligned to\nthe biological use case, simply the absolute rotational err or\nof the head. We employ the same method shown in [ 10]\nto calculate the rotation error of the head of each pigeon in\neach frame, in terms of the yaw, pitch and roll axis rela-\ntive to the forward axis (axis from the mid-point betweenthe eyes towards the beak). The acceptable rotational error\nin head orientation depends on the spatial arrangement of\ngaze targets, such as conspeci\ufb01cs or objects of interest (e. g.\nfood) within the observation arena. In most experimental\nsetups, these targets are typically separated by more than\n10\u25e6. Moreover, pigeons generally move their eyes within\na narrow range\u2014typically no more than 5\u25e6\u2014when attend-\ning to distant objects [ 30,54]. Therefore, a head orientation\nerror within 5\u25e6from 3D posture tracking is considered an\nacceptable margin for reliably estimating gaze direction.\n4.2. Results\nWe refer to Table 2for the comparison between ML and\napplication-speci\ufb01c metrics. Firstly, we \ufb01nd that based on\nthe median head rotation error, all of the models compared\nare below 5\u25e6, con\ufb01rming that the 3D-MuPPET framework\nis appropriate for the gaze estimation task. In this context ,\nany of the architectures would have been within the accept-\nable accuracy, so the end user can consider other factors lik e\ninference speed or trajectory tracking accuracy when decid -\ning which architecture to use (see [ 52]).\nNext, we show that the model with the best per-\nformance in terms of Euclidean distance errors and\nPCK\u2014LToHP\u2014does not correspond to the best perfor-\nmance when evaluated using head rotation angle, where 3D-\nDLC* performs better (Table 2). This discrepancy appears\nto be driven by 3D-DLC*\u2019s lower accuracy in estimating\nyaw (i.e., horizontal head rotation), which is important if\ngaze targets are arranged on the same eye-level as the pi-\ngeon, which is typically the case. However, we also \ufb01nd\nthat LToHP yields the lowest RMSE in head rotation angle,\n4\n\nsuggesting it may produce fewer outliers. In the original\n3D-MuPPET publication [ 52], the authors recommend 3D-\nViTPose* as the most accurate model (excluding LToHP).\nYet, based on our evaluation using an application-speci\ufb01c\nmetric, 3D-DLC* appears to perform best. This further\nhighlights the discrepancy between standard ML metrics\nand application-speci\ufb01c evaluation.\n5. Discussion & Conclusion\nWe presented two case studies that evaluate computer\nvision models using ML and application-speci\ufb01c metrics.\nIn both cases we report misalignment between metrics,\ndemonstrating that current ML-focused benchmarking is\nnot always optimized to facilitate effective downstream ap -\nplication of models, and complementary mechanisms to\nevaluate them in this context are needed. Case Study 1\nshows that model-derived abundance estimates of chim-\npanzees diverges notably from those produced using man-\nual annotations, despite high ML performance. Similarly,\nCase Study 2 shows that the best model for 3D posture es-\ntimation is not the best model for estimating head rotation.\nThis highlights the potential for end-users to be misled by\nimpressive ML benchmarks or invest substantial resources\n(e.g., data collection, annotation, compute [ 50]) optimising\nmodel performance that fails to translate in practice.\nFurther analysis of why ML and application-speci\ufb01c\nmetrics can be mismatched is needed, though many plau-\nsible explanations exist. For example, in Case Study 1\nthe model is applied in an OOD setting (see Sec. 3.1)\nwhich may degrade performance and ultimately contribute\nto the mismatch between metrics \u2013 a key challenge in\nML [ 1,3,33]. In case study 2, rotation estimation is likely\nmore sensitive than position estimation, as rotational err ors\ncan be compounded in unpredictable ways by small errors\nin point estimates. These challenges are often found in real -\nworld deployments, and these aspects deserve consideratio n\nwhen developing and benchmarking SOTA algorithms.\nFinally, while we present case studies where ML and\napplication-speci\ufb01c metrics can be mismatched, we ac-\nknowledge that in certain cases, these metrics can also be\naligned. However, this does not downplay the importance\nof introducing complementary application-speci\ufb01c metric s\nin current benchmarking pipelines, to better bridge novel\nalgorithms to downstream applications.\nFuture Directions To work toward solutions of the pre-\nsented challenges, we recommend introducing application-\nspeci\ufb01c metrics in existing and new CV datasets with\nbiological/ecological relevance, as complementary bench -\nmarks to traditional ML metrics. While datasets can be used\nto solve many different problems, researchers could intro-\nduce complementary metrics for core problems relating to\nthe proposed application domain of the dataset. This can\nhopefully encourage novel models to benchmark comple-mentary metrics that better represent the ef\ufb01cacy of a model\nfor downstream applications. Finally, similar to [ 47,50], we\nencourage more interdisciplinary collaboration between C V\nresearchers and ecologists/biologists, to better align co m-\nputer vision solutions to real-life problems, which will le ad\nto more holistic solutions as the \ufb01eld continues to grow.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsge-\nmeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under\nGermany\u2019s Excellence Strategy\u2014 EXC 2117\u2014422037984,\nand DFG project number 15990824.

This work is licensed under CC BY -NC-ND 4.0  \nAbstract  \nSocial scoring is one of the AI practices banned by the AI Act. This ban is explicitly inspired \nby China, which in 2014 announced its intention to set up a large -scale government project \u2013 \nthe Social Credit System \u2013 aiming to rate every Chinese citizen acc ording to their good \nbehaviour, using digital technologies and AI. But in Europe, individuals are also scored by \npublic and private bodies in a variety of contexts, such as assessing creditworthiness, \nmonitoring employee productivity, detecting social frau d or terrorist risks, and so on. However, \nthe AI Act does not intend to prohibit these types of scoring, as they would qualify as \u201chigh -\nrisk AI systems\u201d, which are authorised while subject to various requirements. One might \ntherefore think that the ban on social scoring will have no practical effect on the scoring \npractices already in use in Europe, and that it is merely a vague safeguard in case an \nauthoritarian power is tempted to set up such a system on European territory. Contrary to this \nview, this art icle argues that the ban has been drafted in a way that is flexible and therefore \nlikely to make it a useful tool, similar and complementary to Article 22 of the General Data \nProtection Regulation, to protect individuals against certain forms of disproport ionate use of \nAI-based scoring.  \nKeywords : social score \u2013 credit scor ing \u2013 profiling \u2013 AI Act \u2013 GDPR \u2013 automated  decision -\nmaking  \u2013 artificial intelligence  \n \n  \n\n2 \n 1. Introduction  \nScores, whether used by public or private actors, are pervasive in our societies. Citizens are \nscored, often without their knowledge, to determine whether they are creditworthy ,1 good \nworkers ,2 safe drivers ,3 potential terrorists ,4 likely to commit social fraud5 and so on.  Claiming \nto predict behaviour, these scores are used to make decisions about individuals in key areas. \nCompanies and public authorities either develop scores themselves or buy them from data \nbrokers and credit agencies who collect and analyse vast quantit ies of data from a variety of \nsources.  \nGiven that s cores are increasingly produced using artificial intelligence ( \u201cAI\u201d) methods, the \nquestion arises as to how they are affected by the recently adopted Artificial Intelligence Act \n(\u201cAI Act\u201d) ,6 and what this regulation changes from existing law.  The risk -based approach that \nstructures this new legislation is now well -known: AI systems which present a too substantial \nrisk are banned, those that present a high risk are subject to a series of legal requirements, and \nthose with a low risk are subject to minimal or no requirement s. While scoring techniques are \nnot regulated as a whole, one of the few banned uses of AI listed in Article 5 concerns \u201csocial \nscoring\u201d.  \nCompared to other banned AI practices such as real -time biometric identification, social scoring \nhas been the subject of relatively little debate between co -legislators. The only major \namendment that has been added to the Commission\u2019s initial proposal is to ban social scoring in \ngeneral, whether implemented by public or private organisations, while th e Commission had \nlimited the ban to public authorities .7 What was clear was that the EU wanted to distinguish \nitself from China, which in 2014 announced its intention to set up a \u201cSocial Credit System \u201d, a \nlarge -scale government project aiming to rate every Chinese citizen according to their good \nbehaviour, using digital technologies and AI. Although the reality in China is more nuance d \u2013 \nthe Social Credit System being far from fully implemented, contrary to what we usually read in \n \n1 Mikella Hurley and Julius Adebayo, \u2018Credit Scoring in the Era of Big Data \u2019 [2016] Yale Journal of Law and \nTechnology 148.  \n2 Javier S \u00e1nchez -Monedero and Lina Dencik, \u2018The Datafication of the Workplace \u2019 (Data Justice Lab, Cardiff \nUniversity 2019) Working paper; Wolfie Christl, \u2018Corporate Surveillance in Everyday Life.

The \nCouncil of the European Union, in its \u201cgeneral approach\u201d of 25 November 2022, endorsed this view, as did the \nEuropean Parliament in the text adopted in spring 2023.  \n\n3 \n the media  \u2013,8 the fact that the EU had this Chinese project in mind when introducing the ban is \nexplicitly acknowledged . The Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton stated in this \nregard that: \u201cThe majority of applications using AI are risk -free. This is not the case for some. \nSocial scoring, for example. China uses it to control individuals. Using data captured without \ntheir knowledge, citizens are classified, evaluated and monitored. We are p roposing to ban this \ntype of artificial intelligence application in Europe.\u201d9 \nHowever, the AI Act\u2019s ban on social scoring is not intended to prevent European citizens from \nbeing scored  (or \u201cclassified, evaluated and monitored\u201d, to use Breton\u2019s words) in any \ncircumstances . Some forms of AI scoring are not even concerned  by the AI Act, such as scoring \nfor advertising purposes .10 And some other forms of scoring, such as credit scoring , insurance \npricing or recidivism risk assessment, qualify as \u201chigh -risk AI systems\u201d,11 meaning that they \nare explicitly authorised while being subject to a number of requirements.  \nIf this ban is not aimed  to aff ect these forms of scoring, one might wonder whether it is likely \nto have any effect on the uses of AI that are already taking place in the EU , a question that \nseems all the more relevant that it now concerns both private and public actors. The fact that \nsocial scoring is presented as only being used in China suggests that its prohibition  is merely \nseen as a vague safeguard in case an authoritarian power is tempted to set up such a frightening \nsystem  on EU territory . \nContrary to this view, this Article argues that the boundary between social scoring and high-\nrisk AI scoring systems within the meaning of the AI Act is far from clear -cut. Indeed, Article \n5(1)(c) , which contains the ban, proves to be drafted broadly, open ing the possibility of wide \napplication. In this regard, the ban on social scoring share s common features  with the \nprohibition of automated decisions set out in Article 22 of the General Data Protection \nRegulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) ,12 and the way the latter has been recently interpreted by the Court of \nJustice of the European Union (\u201cCJEU\u201d) in the recent SCHUF A Holding AG  case13 can be taken \nas a source of inspiration to anticipate the scope of Article 5(1)(c) .  \nIn brief, and this assertion will be developed throughout this Article , the \u201csocial\u201d nature of a \nscore (which makes it prohibited) is not an inherent characteristic of the score but rather a matter \n \n8 Zeyi Yang, \u2018China Just Announced a New Social Credit Law.

One score can be lawful in one case , and qualify as a social score in another because \nof the way it is used. This has important implications in terms of the rights of data subjects : far \nfrom being a useless provision, Article 5(1)(c) of the AI Act can be used as a tool \u2013 similar to \nArticle 22 of the GDPR \u2013 to protect individuals against some forms of disproportionate uses of \nAI-based scores.  \nTo support this claim, th e second section of this  Article begins by examining how scores were \nfirst regulated by data protection law through the prohibition of automated decision -making, a \nprovision that has its roots in the 1978 French \u201c Informatique et libert\u00e9s \u201d law and is now set out \nin Article 22 of the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) .14 In this regard, the \nSCHUF A case held by the CJEU is discussed. The third section then describe s the core \nprinciples of the AI Act and how it tackles scoring techniques. Finally, t he fourth  section focuses \non the ban o n social scoring by examining the wording of the AI Act as well as the detailed \nguidelines published by the European Commission on prohibited AI practices.15 It argues for a \nbroad interpretation that makes this ban a protection against disproportionate uses of AI -based \nscores.  \nDrawing on the existing literature on scoring techniques and the risks  they pose to fundamental \nrights ,16 this Article  offers the first in -depth discussion of how scoring is addressed by the AI \nAct and, in particular, of the implications of the ban on social scoring in light of existing scoring \npractices . \n2. Scores and automated decisions in the GDPR  \nScoring systems aim to assess or predict a trait relating to an individual  (or a group of \nindividuals)  \u2013 such as creditworthiness  or health status  \u2013 using data analytics  and AI.17  \nSchematically, a scoring system is developed in the following way: a database is built up, for \nexample of previous borrowers if the aim is to assess creditworthiness. This data may include \ninformation such as credit history, whether they have a bank accoun t, type of employment, \nprofessional experience, marital status, etc. The data is then divided in two parts \u2013 those who \n \n14 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural \npersons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing \nDirective 95/46/EC (General Data Prot ection Regulation) [2016] OJ L 119/1.  \n15 European Commission, \u2018 Annex to the Communication to the Commission Approval of the content of the draft \nCommunication from the Commission - Commission Guidelines on prohibited artificial intelligence practices \nestablished by Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (AI Act) \u2019, C(2025) 884 final  (\u2018Guidelines  on prohibited AI practices \u2019). \nThe publication of these guidelines was required by Article 96(1)(b)  of the AI Act . Note that a draft version of this \narticle \u2013 which was submitted in September 2024 \u2013 was shared  in August 2024 with the team at the AI Office \n(European Commission) working on these guidelines, and that some statements from this article have been directly \nreproduced in the guidelines. Where this is the case, it is indicated in footnotes.  \n16 See inter alia : Francesca Palmiotto, \u2018When Is a Decision Automated? A Taxonomy for a Fundamental Rights \nAnalysis \u2019 (2024) 25 German Law Journal 210; Dencik and others (n 5); Tal Zarsky, \u2018Understanding Discrimination \nin the Scored Society \u2019 (2014) 89 Washington Law Review 1375; Danielle K Citron and Frank Pasquale, \u2018The \nScored Society: Due Process for Automated Predictions \u2019 (2014) 89 Washington Law Review 1; Mireille \nHildebrandt and Serge Gutwirth (eds), Profiling the European Citizen: Cross -Disciplinary Perspectives  (2008).  \nThe title of this article deliberately echoes that of the classic book Profiling the European Citizen  just mentioned . \n17 See Dencik and others (n 5) 10.  Legal entities are also scored by commercial credit agencies and credit rating \nagencies (as regards financial markets) . However, since both the GDPR and the ban on social scoring concern \ndecisions made about natural persons, we leave aside legal entities.  \n\n5 \n have duly repaid their loans and those who have not \u2013 in order to identify the combination of \ncharacteristics that tend to predict the target value \u2013 in this case, creditworthiness. Each variable \nis therefore weighted according to whether it correlates wit h being a good or bad borrower. In \nthe end, the scoring system enables a new applicant to be rated on the basis of his or her own \ncharacteristics. The higher the score, the more likely the applicant is to repay the loan.  \nAlthough scoring systems largely predate the emergence of contemporary AI techniques,18 the \nrise of Big Data and machine learning has given them considerable importance in a wide range \nof fields and stimulated their mass adoption by private and public actors .19 By contrast with \ntraditional statistical techniques, AI models can be fed by a large number of variables that often \ncome directly from people\u2019s behaviour as recorded by computers, mobile phones and ubiquitous \nconnected devices. Organisations such as credit institutions, telecom firms, insurance \ncompanies, retailers and major platforms score individuals for a variety of purposes, including \ntargeted advertising, credit and risk assessment, employee productivity monitoring, and so o n.20 \nScoring systems have also attracted public authorities at national or local level which use them \nto detect phenomena such as risk of child abuse, welfare fraud, recidivism, terrorism, irregular \nimmigration, etc.21 \nScores and scoring systems as such are not defined in EU law. However, EU data protection \nlaw contains the notion of profiling which close ly align s with scoring.  The GDPR defines it as \n\u201cany form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to \nevaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person , in particular to analyse or predict \naspects concerning that natural person\u2019s performance at work, economic situation, health, \npersonal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements \u201d.22 The main \nprovision of the GDPR dealing with profiling is Article 22 which prohibits automated decisions. \nIt states that: \u201cthe data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely \n \n18 See inter alia  in the banking, criminal justice and insurance sectors:  Josh Lauer, Creditworthy: A History of \nConsumer Surveillance and Financial Identity in America  (Columbia University Press 2017); Daniel Bouk, How \nOur Days Became Numbered: Risk and the Rise of the Statistical Individual  (University of Chicago Press 2015); \nBernard E Harcourt, Against Prediction: Profiling, Policing, and Punishing in an Actuarial Age  (University of \nChicago Press 2007).   \n19 There literature on the contemporary importance of scoring techniques is now very large. See notably: Marion \nFourcade and Kieran Joseph Healy, The Ordinal Society  (Harvard University Press 2024); Dencik and others (n \n5); Eubanks (n 5); Citron and Pasquale (n 16); Marion Fourcade and Kieran Healy, \u2018Classification Situations: Life -\nChances in the Neoliberal Era \u2019 (2013) 38 Accounting, Organizations and Society 559.  \n20 Antonio Aloisi and Valerio De Stefano, Your Boss Is an Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence, Platform Work and \nLabour  (Hart 2022); Ifeoma Ajunwa, \u2018Algorithms at Work: Productivity Monitoring Applications and Wearable \nTechnology as the New Data -Centric Research Agenda for Employment and Labor Law \u2019 (2018) 63 Saint Louis \nUniversity Law Journal 21; Christl (n 2).  \n21 See Julia Angwin and others, \u2018Machine Bias \u2019 (ProPublica , 23 May 2016) \n<https://www.propublica.org/article/machine -bias-risk-assessments -in-criminal -sentencing> accessed 16 August \n2023; Eubanks (n 5); Dencik and others (n 5); Sam Desiere, Kristine Langenbucher and Ludo Struyven, \u2018Statistical \nProfiling in Public Employment Services: An International Comparison \u2019, vol 224 (2019) OECD Social, \nEmployment and Migration Working Papers 224; Dubois (n 5); Charly Derave, Nathan Genicot and Nina \nHetmanska, \u2018The Risks of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence: The Case of the European Travel Information and \nAuthorisation System \u2019 (2022) 13 European Journal of Risk Regulation 389.  The notion of \u201crisk assessment tool \u201d \nis largely synonymous with scoring system, but it emphasizes that what is being assessed is framed as a risk (e.g., \nthe risk of offending or irregular immigration). In contrast, scoring systems have a broader scope, as they can be \nused to predict outcomes  that are not necessarily undesirable (e.g., in marketing, predicting who is likely to click \non a certain link).  \n22 Article 4(4) of the GDPR.  \n\n6 \n on automated processing, including profiling , which produces legal effects concerning him or \nher or similarly significantly affects him or her\u201d. The second paragraph of the same provision , \nthough, provides for important exceptions to this prohibition, automated decisions  being lawful \nif they are necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract, authorised by law or based \non the explicit consent of the data subject . However, even when these exceptions apply, Article \n22(2)(b) and (3) require the data  controller to implement \u201csuitable measures to safeguard the \ndata subject\u2019s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests\u201d and \u201cat least the right to obtain \nhuman intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and to \ncontest  the decision\u201d. This involves the right to get \u201cmeaningful information about the logic \ninvolved [in the automated decision], as well as the significance and the envisaged \nconsequences of such processing for the data subject \u201d.23  \nAutomated decisions about individuals, whether by private actors or public authorities, often \ninvolve profiling and scoring, as they typically assess the likelihood of a person having a certain \ncharacteristic (e.g., being creditworthy, a welfare fraudster,  or a recidivist). Scoring systems \ncalculate this probability, and the decision is made by setting a threshold: if the score exceeds \nthis threshold, the individual will be considered to possess this quality (e .g. creditworthy) and \nwill be treated according ly (e.g. receive a credit).  \nA detour through the history of this provision confirms this  strong link between scores and \nautomated decisions . Article 22 of the GDPR is the successor to Article 15 of Directive \n95/46/EC ,24 which was itself directly inspired by the French \u201c Informatique et libert\u00e9s \u201d law of \n6 January 1978, one of the first  data protection  laws adopted in Europe. Article 2(2) of this law \nstipulated that \u201c[n]o administrative or private decision involving an assessment of human \nbehaviour may be based solely on automated processing of information giving a definition of \nthe profile or personality of the person concerned \u201d.25  \nThe raison d'\u00eatre  for this provision in the French law was to be found in projects run by the \npublic authorities , in particular the GAMIN  system (for \u201c gestion automatis\u00e9e de m\u00e9decine \ninfantile \u201d), a scoring system designed in 1970 by the Ministry of Health to prevent disabilities \nin children .26 Using data from health certificates issued by doctors during medical check -ups, \nit was designed to automatically identify children at risk who required medical or social \nassistance. The information included data such as the parents \u2019 occupation. When the scoring \nsystem (which was not based on AI but on more traditional statistical methods) identified a \nchild as being at risk, this could lead, for example, to compulsory referral to special education \nprogrammes. However , the most precarious  members of the population were more likely to see \ntheir children receive  this label , which provoked strong criticism and played a decisive role in \nthe introduction of a ban on solely automated decisions .27 In the 1980s, the discussions \n \n23 Articles 13(2)(f), 14(2)(g) and 15(1)(h) of the GDPR.  \n24 Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council  of 24  October 1995 on the protection of \nindividuals with regard to the  processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data  (O.J.

In its 1985 report, the CNIL note d that \u201cdecisions \nto grant or refuse credit to finance the purchase of goods or services are taken on the basis of \n[a] score\u201d and question ed the legality of this practice with regard to the prohibition of automated \ndecisions .28 \nFollowing the migration of this provision (with some amendments) into Directive 95/46/EC \nand then into the GDPR, and with the rise of algorithmic and AI systems, the prohibition o f \nautomated decisions has become all the more topical . The provision contains two main criteria \nwhich both have given rise to considerable doctrinal debate: i) the decision about the data \nsubject must produce legal or significant effects; ii) the decision must be solely automated.  \nFirst, r egarding the legal or significant effects , Recital 71 of the GDPR illustrates these effects \nby mentioning the refusal of a credit application and online recruitment practices. The Article \n29 Working Party guidelines written on profiling and automated decision -making \u2013 which have \nonly doctrinal value \u2013 provides more examples .29 In terms of legal effects, the guidelines refer \nto events such as the cancellation of a contract, the refusal of a social benefit granted by law, or \nthe refusal of a residence permit in a country. In terms of significant effects, the guidelines \nspecify  that this should refer to effects which \u201csignificantly affect the circumstances, behaviour \nor choices of the individuals concerned; have a prolonged or permanent impact on the data \nsubject; or at its most extreme, lead to the exclusion or discrimination o f individuals\u201d .30 \nExamples include access to health services or to educational institution s. \nSecond, when is a decision solely  automated ?31 Although it may seem obvious at first glance, \nit is difficult to define a clear criterion for distinguishing a decision that has been automated \nfrom one in which a human being is involved. Indeed, decision -making systems concerning \nindividuals are rarely f ully automated. Human agents are often involved at one stage or another, \nbut this doesn\u2019t mean that algorithms can\u2019t play a decisive role. The Article 29 Working Party \nconsiders that the condition of human involvement implies that the oversight of the deci sion \nmust be \u201cmeaningful, rather than just a token gesture\u201d .32 But what if, for example, an automated \ndecision -making system identifies people suspected of having committed welfare fraud, which \nthen triggers a control by government officials. The control itself would be carried out by a \nhuman being, but it would have  been triggered because of a prior automated decision.

Article 29 Working Party has written guidelines on \nprofiling and automated -decision making (which had been amended by the European Data Protection Board): \nArticle 29 Working Party (n 29).

How does one  determine whether the agent\u2019s involvement is \nsufficiently meaningful?  \nImportantly, t he first major case in which the CJEU had the opportunity to rule on the scope of \nthis provision is the case C -634/21 SCHUF A Holding AG  which  only dates back to 2023 .33 It \nprecisely relates to scores, namely a credit score  produced by the German consumer credit \nagency SCHUFA. This company was founded in 1927, when the German consumer credit \nmarket was being nationalised. In the 1970s, it had almost 22 million files, representing around \n80% of the country\u2019s working populatio n and it remains today the main credit bureau in the \ncountry .34 The dispute arose from a SCHUFA credit score sold to a third party (a bank or other \ntype of credit institution) which led this third party to refuse a loan to the applicant. After being \nrefused the loan, the applicant asked SCHUFA to disclose information about the data stored and \nto erase incorrect data. In response, SCHUFA informed her that her score was 85.96%, and \nprovided some general information about the methodology used, but refused to say more, \nclaiming business confidentiality. The applicant then sued SCHUFA, relying on various \nprovisions of the GDPR, in particular Article 22.  \nThe main issue was indeed the applicability of article 22 as SCHUFA itself does not grant any \nloans nor provide any services to individuals, it merely offers information to commercial actors. \nTherefore, strictly speaking, SCHUFA does not take any decisions  concerning anyone as it has \nno contractual relationship with consumers. However, depending on how credit institutions \ninterpret a score, its influence varies. A score may be only one of many factors considered or, \nconversely, it may be the only criterion taken into account by the lending institution. In many \ncases, a lending institution will not base its decision solely on the credit bureau score but will \nautomatically refuse to grant credit to applicants with a score below a certain threshold. In such \na case, it is difficult to determine where exactly the decision is taken. Is the decision taken solely \nby the credit institution, or is the SCHUFA score itself a decision?  \nTo answer this question, the CJEU relies on the description given by the German referring court, \naccording to which the third party draws \u201cstrongly\u201d on credit scores so that an insufficient \nSCHUFA score leads \u201cin almost all cases, to the refusal of that ba nk to grant the loan applied \nfor\u201d.35 This factual finding demonstrates, according to the Court, that the score itself constitute \na decision even though the entity producing the credit score is not the lending institution.  \nScores are therefore not explicitly mentioned in the GDPR, but they are nonetheless directly \naffected by the ban on automated decisions.  A score which strongly leads to certain \nconsequences corresponding to \u201clegal or significant effects\u201d is prohibited, unless exceptions \napply (such as an explicit law authorising this automated decision).  However, as the CJEU \nfound in the SCHUFA case, the \u201cdecision -making\u201d nature of a score is a matter of context and \n \n33 Judgment of the 7  December 2023, SCHUF A Holding AG, Case C -634/21,  ECLI:EU:C:2023:957.

The same score may be classified as an \nautomated decision in certain circumstances, but not in others.   \nIn addition to EU data protection law , scoring techniques will now have to comply with the AI \nAct. The question we must now address, therefore, is how this new legislation deals with \nscoring techniques and to what extent it complements the prohibition on automated decisions \nalready present in the GDPR. This is examined in the following two sections.  \n3. Scores  in the AI Act  \nTo understand how the AI Act addresses scoring techniques, it is useful to take a look at the \nEthics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI (\u201cEthics Guidelines \u201d), published in 2019 by the High -\nLevel Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence set up by the European Commission and which \nhad a strong influence on the Commission\u2019s regulation proposal .36  \nScoring techniques are discussed in the document among other examples of AI use that raise \ncritical concerns, and are described as endangering the principles of autonomy and non -\ndiscrimination. However, the Ethics Guidelines draw a distinction between \u201ccitizen scoring \u2013 \non a large or smaller scale \u2013 [that] is already often used in purely descriptive and domain -\nspecific scoring\u201d and \u201cnormative citizen scoring (general assessment of \u201cmoral personality\u201d or \n\u201cethical integrity\u201d) in  all aspects and on a large sca le\u201d which presents a risk for democratic \nvalues, especially \u201cwhen used disproportionately and without a delineated and communicated \nlegitimate purpose\u201d .37 \nWhat seems to distinguish this normative citizen scoring from other types of scoring is 1) that \nit consists of a general assessment of the individual\u2019s personality and 2) that this assessment is \nnot specific to one area or purpose but has consequences for all aspects of life, and is used \ndisproportionately. The first point concerns what might be called the stage of \u201cscore design\u201d, \ni.e. the way in which the score is developed and what it is intended to assess. And the second \npoint concerns what might be call ed the sage of \u201cscore use\u201d, i.e. the uses made of the score and \nthe consequences attached to it.  \nTo some extent, this distinction between normative citizen scoring and other types of scoring \ncorrespond to the distinction  that can be found in the AI Act  between social scoring and high -\nrisk AI scoring systems . As we know, t his regulation is both general in its application, since in \nprinciple it covers all types of AI systems, and risk -based, since the level of requirements and \nobligations imposed on the AI system depends on the risk the system poses to health, safety and \nfundamental rights. While certain  so-called \u201cAI practices\u201d are prohibited because the risk they \npose is deemed \u201cunacceptable\u201d, other AI systems are classified as \u201chigh -risk\u201d and therefore \n \n36 High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence, \u2018Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI \u2019 (European \nCommission 2019).  \n37 ibid 34.  As explained in Introduction, th is normative citizen scoring clearly refers to th e Chinese social credit \nsystem project . \n\n10 \n authorised but subject to a series of requirements .38 Certain other AI systems, such as chatbots, \nwhich present a low risk, are subject to transparency and information requirements .39  \nIn line with this logic, AI-based scores are regulated differently depending on their level of risk. \nFirst, \u201csocial scoring\u201d is one of the prohibited practices set out in Article 5 (1)(c)  of the AI Act . \nReproduc ing the distinction between the design of the score (first paragraph) and the use of the \nscore (points (i) and (ii) of the second paragraph), th is provision states that:  \nAre prohibited \u201cthe placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of AI \nsystems for the purpose of the evaluation or classification of natural persons or groups \nof persons over a certain period of time based on their social behaviour or known,  \ninferred or predicted personal or personality characteristics, with the social score leading \nto either or both of the following:  \n(i) detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain natural persons or whole groups \nof persons in social contexts that are unrelated to the contexts in which the data \nwas originally generated or collected;  \n(ii) detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of \npersons that is unjustified or disproportionate to their social behaviour or its \ngravity.\u201d40 \nIn addition, there are also traces of scoring systems in the list of high -risk AI systems. While  \nthe word \u201cscore\u201d is only mentioned once to refer  to credit scoring , a closer look at Annex III \nleads to the conclusion that many other high -risk AI systems in fact consist of a scoring system. \nWithout being exhaustive, we can mention AI systems used to recruit new employees or assess \ntheir performance once they have been h ired,41 to select and rate insurers for life and health \ninsurance,42 to assess the eligibility of citizens for public assistance benefits,43 to assess the risk \n \n38 The classification rules for high -risk AI systems are contained in Article 6  which refers to Annexes of the \nRegulation. One the one hand, a list of different types of AI systems lies in Annex III . On the other hand , AI \nsystems that are used as a  safety component of a  product (or are themselves a  product) covered by the Union \nharmonisation legislation listed in Annex  I, and that require third -party conformity assessment pursuant to this \nlegislation are also classifie d as high -risk. There are also specific rules for general -purpose AI models (See Chapter \nV of the AI Act).  \n39 Most of the rules contained in the AI Act will apply from 2 August 2026, but the rules relating to prohibited \npractices came into force on 2 February 2025.  \n40 In addition, Recital 31 precises that \u201cAI systems providing social scoring of natural persons by public or private \nactors may lead to discriminatory outcomes and the exclusion of certain groups. (\u2026) Such AI systems evaluate or \nclassify natural persons or groups thereof on the basis of multiple data points related to their social behaviour in \nmultiple contexts or known, inferred or predicted personal or personality characteristics over certain periods of \ntime. (\u2026) AI systems entailing such unacceptable scor ing practices and leading to such detrimental or \nunfavourable outcomes should be therefore prohibited. That prohibition should not affect lawful evaluation \npractices of natural persons that are carried out for a specific purpose in accordance with Union an d national law.\u201d  \n41 Annex III (4)(a) of the AI Act.  \n42 Annex III ( 5)(c) of the AI Act.  \n43 Annex III ( 5)(a) of the AI Act.  \n\n11 \n of recidivism44 or to assess the risk of illegal immigration.45 As explained in the previous \nsection, a ll these applications are likely to rely on scoring methods .46 \nOn the one hand, the legal regime applicable to the ban on social scoring is simple : if a score \nfalls within its scope , it is unlawful . The underlying logic is therefore very similar to that of \nArticle 22 of the GDPR: like automated decisions, social scores are prohibited .47 In contrast, \nthe rules imposed on high -risk AI systems are very complex. These include establishing a risk \nmanagement system, drafting technical documentation which demonstrates compliance with \nthe AI Act, maintaining a data governance framework (which notably aims to control the quality \nand representativeness of the data used to feed the AI  model), ensuring that a human oversees \nthe AI system and its outputs, etc.48 Before placing a \u201chigh -risk\u201d AI system on the market or \nputting it into service, the providers of such systems will have to carry out a conformity \nassessment to ensure that they meet all these obligations.  \nThe ban on social scoring is thus not intended to affect licit uses of scores, including high -risk \nAI scoring systems. In this sense, the last sentence of Recital 31 of the AI Act states that the \n\u201cprohibition [of social scoring] should not affect lawful ev aluation practices of natural persons \nthat are carried out for a specific purpose in accordance with Union and national law\u201d.49  \nHowever, the boundary between social scoring and other forms of scoring is not necessarily \nstraightforward. As underlined by the European Commission  in its Guidelines on prohibited AI \npractices , \u201cthe use of AI systems classified as high -risk may in some cases qualify as a \nprohibited practice in specific instances if all conditions under one or more of the prohibitions \nin Article 5 AI Act are fulfilled\u201d.50 To understand when a score risks being prohibited under \nArticle 5(1)(c), it is therefore essential to take a close look at the conditions set out in this \nprovision.  \n4. How to distinguish social scoring from lawful scoring?  \nUsing the distinction between score design and score use, this final section analyses Article \n5(1)(c) and compares it to existing scoring practices. This will enable us to test the robustness \nof the distinction  between social scoring within the meaning of the AI Act and other forms of \nscoring and to determine what the foreseeable effects of the ban will be . By following a step -\nby-step analysis, the analysis will show that the scope of the ban is broad and likely to cover \ndifferent types of scoring devices.  \n \n44 Annex III ( 6)(d) of the AI Act.  \n45 Annex III ( 7)(b) of the AI Act.  \n46 It should be noted that AI systems listed in Annex III will not automatically be classified as high -risk given that \na provision, Article 6(3), was added during the legislative process allowing providers to escape from this \nqualification in some circumstances (for instance when the AI system only performs a narrow procedural task). \nBut interestingly, the last paragraph adds that AI systems listed in Annex III \u201cshall always be considered to be \nhigh-risk where the AI system performs profiling of natural persons\u201d. This precision is important since scoring is \nalways a form of profiling, as e xplained in the previous section. This means that a scoring system falling under \none of the AI systems listed in Annex III should always be considered as high risk.  \n47 However, as discussed in the conclusion, unlike Article 22 of the GDPR, Article 5(1)(c) of the AI Act does not \nprovide for any exceptions.  \n48 See Chapter  2 of the AI Act.  \n49 See also Guidelines on prohibited AI practices  (n 15) 61, para. 175.  \n50 Guidelines on prohibited AI practices  (n 15) 12, para. 37. \n\n12 \n 4.1. The stage of score design  \nSimply put, the first paragraph of Articles 5(1)(c) defines \u201csocial score\u201d as the evaluation or \nclassification of natural persons based on their \u201csocial behaviour\u201d or \u201cknown, inferred or \npredicted personal or personality characteristics\u201d.  \nThis definition is close to the definition of profiling set out in EU data protection law which \nwas discussed in Section 2.51 Both definitions refer to the evaluation of a natural person.52 One \nmajor relevant difference is that the AI Act only concerns AI systems while the GDPR mentions \nautomated processing of data, which is not necessarily based on AI.   \nAnother important difference is that the definition of profiling requires the evaluation to be \nbased on personal data, while the definition of social scoring makes no reference to personal \ndata but rather to social behaviour, personality characteristics an d personal characteristic. None \nof these concepts are defined in the regulation.53 \nWhat is behaviour and, subsequently, what is \u201csocial behaviour \u201d (as opposed to behaviour that \nis not social)? If we think of digital traces, should we consider that interactions on social media \nare social behaviour, but that browsing history is not? The entire history of the social and \nbehavioural sciences has been ma rked by discussions on the meaning and limits of these two \nconcepts, and the least we can say is that there is no clear, unequivocal understanding of them.  \nAs for the concept of \u201cpersonality characteristic \u201d, it has its origin in psychology, which since \nthe 19th century has attempted to categorise and classify human beings on the basis of their \nmental aptitudes or personality. From the outset, psychometric tests were designed to \ndistinguish between children on the basis of their aptitudes or to select and guide j ob \napplicants .54 Today, there is a great deal of work looking at the use of personality traits for \npredictive purposes. Some studies examine the psychological determinants of employability \n(which is considered useful for public services when dealing with the unemployed) .55 In the \n \n51 In the same sense, see Guidelines on prohibited AI practices  (n 15) 52, para. 154.  \n52 As the European Commission\u2019s G uidelines on prohibited AI practices  point out, the notion of classification \n(which is also included in the definition) is even broader than the notion of evaluation, since it includes assignment \nto a category such as age or gender  (Guidelines on prohibited AI practices  (n 15) 52, para 153) . See also  Article \n29 Working Party (n 29) 7.  It also worth noting that scores should be distinguished from individual ratings by \nwhich consumers assess the quality of a service (such as an Uber driver, or a restaurant) as these ratings do not \ninvolve AI but consist of a mere aggregation of individua l preferences. AI -enabled scoring on its part is not a \nmatter of summing up individual preferences, but of assessing the probability of future behaviour. The European \nCommission's guidelines align with this perspective (see Ibid. 61). \n53 The term \u201cpersonality characteristic\u201d is also mentioned in the text in relation to AI systems intended to be used \nby law enforcement authorities or on their behalf to assess personality traits and characteristics of natural persons \nor groups (See Article 5 (1)(d) and Annex III, (6)(d)).  \n54 For an overview of the work carried out in this field at the time: JM Lahy, \u2018Les Profils Psychologiques Dans La \nS\u00e9lection et l \u2019orientation Professionnelle \u2019 [1926] Prophylaxie mentale 178; Hugo M \u00fcnsterberg, Psychology and \nIndustrial Efficiency  (The Riverside Press 1913).  \n55 Claude Houssemand, Anne Pignault and Raymond Meyers, \u2018A Psychological Typology of Newly Unemployed \nPeople for Profiling and Counselling \u2019 (2014) 33 Current Psychology 301; Selver Derya Uysal and Winfried \nPohlmeier, \u2018Unemployment Duration and Personality \u2019 (2011) 32 Journal of Economic Psychology 980; Majella J \nAlbion, Karen M Fernie and Lorelle J Burton, \u2018Individual Differences in Age and Self -Efficacy in the \nUnemployed \u2019 (2005) 57 Australian Journal of Psychology 11.  Uysal and Pohlmeier show, for example, that of the \ndifferent personalities in the famous Big Five model, the \u2018conscientious mind\u2019 personality type has a high \nprobability of finding a job, while the \u2018neuroticism\u2019 personality type has little chance of findin g a job quickly.   \n\n13 \n field of credit too, psychometrics is often used. The company LenddoEFL \u2013 which specialises \nin the use of alternative data for credit assessment \u2013 explains on its website that \u201ca psychometric \ncredit assessment provides an alternative for thin -file loan app licants ( i.e., zero or low credit \nhistory) by generating credit scores based on personality and behavior\u201d .56 Other research \nattempts to show how various sources of data can be used to predict personality traits. In a 2013 \narticle, researchers studied the predictive power of Facebook likes with regard to various \npersonal characteristics, including the Big Five pe rsonality dimensions, intelligence and even \nsexual orientation .57 This is all the more relevant given that Article 5(1)(c) specifies that not \nonly \u201cknown\u201d but also \u201cinferred or predicted\u201d personality characteristics are concerned.  \nLastly, \u201cpersonal characteristic \u201d is probably the broadest of the three notions.58 It seems very \nclose to the concept of personal data that is defined in Article 4(1) of the GDPR as \u201cany \ninformation relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u2018data subject\u2019)\u201d and has been \ninterpreted in a flexible and extensive way by the CJEU .59 This broad definition and the ongoing \nprocess of datafication of all aspects of society have led some to conclude that almost any data \ncan be personal data, making data protection law the \u201claw of everything\u201d .60 The notion of \npersonal characteristic could be considered to have an even fuzzier meaning than that of \npersonal data, since it is not defined in the text and the condition of \u201cidentifiability\u201d contained \nin the definition of personal data is therefore not required. In this sense, it would be sufficient \nfor a piece of information to relate to an individual for it to constitute a personal characteristic.  \nGiven all this, it does not seem excessive to conclude that all types of data are covered by Article \n5(1)(c).  As a result, it is really difficult to imagine an individual AI-based score which would \nnot qualify as a \u201csocial score\u201d under this definition.  One might even argue that every time an \nAI system evaluates or classifies someone, it performs \u201csocial scoring\u201d within the meaning of \nthe AI Act. This definition however is problematic because it corresponds to any form of scoring \nand it is hard to see what exactly makes the scorin g social . Think of credit scoring already \nmentioned: it is the evaluation of someone on the basis of certain personal characteristics (such \nas income, age, family situation, consumer habits, etc.). This is precisely the definition of social \nscoring given i n the AI Act.  \nThe definition of \u201csocial score\u201d was presumably intended to refer to AI systems assessing a \nperson\u2019s \u201cmorality\u201d, \u201cintegrity\u201d or \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d. But in the end, looking at the precise \nwording of the provision, it appears to encompass any form of individual scoring. As far as the \n \n56 \u2018LenddoEFL \u2019 (LenddoEFL , 17 May 2021) <https://lenddoefl.com> accessed 16 July 2024.

In \nour view, personal characteristics have a broader scope than personality traits. See Guidelines on prohibited AI \npractices  (n 15) 54, para. 159.  \n59 Lee A Bygrave and Luca Tosoni, \u2018Article 4(1).

Broad Concept of Personal Data and Future of EU Data Protection \nLaw\u2019 (2018) 10 Law, Innovation and Technology 40.   \n\n14 \n score design stage is concerned, there is therefore nothing that distinguishes social scoring from \nlawful scoring. What remains to be examined is the question of the uses to which a score may \nbe put.  \n4.2. The stage of score use  \nThe second part of Article 5(1)(c) provides that social scores are banned only a) if they lead to  \n\u201cdetrimental or unfavourable treatment\u201d b) in \u201csocial contexts that are unrelated to the contexts \nin which the data was originally generated or collected\u201d and/or c) \u201cthat is unjustified or \ndisproportionate to their social behaviour or its gravity\u201d.  \n4.2.1. A score leading to a detrimental treatment  \nThis criterion  conceals two questions: what is a detrimental or unfavourable treatment? And \nwhen does a score lead to a detrimental or prejudicial treatment? These interrogations are \nstrikingly similar to those raised by Article 22 of the GDPR.  \nFirst, the condition of a detrimental of unfavourable treatment echoes the \u201clegal or significant \neffects \u201d of Article 22  discussed in Section 2 since t he expression \u201cdetrimental of prejudicial \ntreatment\u201d used in the AI Act, although vague, also refers to the impact of the score on the \nsituation of the scored subject, which corresponds more broadly to the logic behind the AI Act\u2019s \nrisk-based approach, i.e . the regulation of AI systems according to their effects. Recital 31 of \nthe AI Act also states that socia l score may lead to \u201cdiscriminatory outcomes and the exclusion \nof certain groups\u201d and \u201cviolate the right to dignity and non -discrimination and the values of \nequality and justice\u201d. Violation of the right to dignity or non -discrimination is therefore not a \ncondition in itself for finding the existence of a prohibited social score within the meaning of \nthe AI Act, but it does constitute the raison d'\u00eatre  underpinning this prohibition. In this regard, \nit is noteworthy that the examples of \u201clegal or significant effects\u201d given by the Article 29 \nWorking Party are very similar to the types of AI use listed as high -risk in the AI Act (i.e. AI \nused in the workpl ace, in educational institutions, in the banking sector, in social welfare, etc.) .61 \nSecond, Article 5(1)(c) of the AI Act provides that social scoring must lead to a detrimental or \nunfavourable treatment in order to be prohibited. In other words, the treatment must be the \nconsequence of the score, and the score the cause of the treatment.62 This parallels the \u201csole \nautomation\u201d criterion of Article 22 of the GDPR. Here again, the wording is less precise than \nArticle 22 of the GDPR since it is not specified that the social score must \u201csolely\u201d lead to the \ntreatment, which gives room for a broad er interpretation. But we can assume that if an AI score \nis only one element among many others leading to the treatment, the provision is less likely to \napply. The score should play a decisive role in order to fall under the scope of Article 5(1)(c). \nHowev er, the conclusion of the SCHUFA Holding CA Case , namely that a score produced by \nan institution other than the one taking the final decision can constitute an automated decision, \nshould be transposed: a score could \u201clead to a detrimental or unfavourable t reatment\u201d even if \n \n61 One difference with Article 22 is that the treatment must be detrimental or unfavourable, while Article 22 does \nnot explicitly require the decision to be negative but only to produce legal or significant effects.  \n62 This analysis has been endorsed by the European Commission in its Guidelines on prohibited AI practices . See \nGuidelines on prohibited AI practices  (n 15) 55, para. 160 -162. \n\n15 \n this score was not produced by the organisation which is the author of the treatment, but by \nanother organisation.  \n4.2.2. The variety of application contexts   \nFinally, one of two alternative criteria (points i) or ii) of the provision) is required for a score to \nfall within the scope of the ban. The first of these two alternative criteria concerns the context \nof application: t he detrimental treatment must have occurred in social contexts unrelated to the \ncontexts in which the data was originally collected  or generated . This condition implicitly \nintends to prohibit the use of a score for multiple purposes. As stated in the Ethics guidelines , \nsocial scoring is supp osed to concern \u201call aspects\u201d. In the same vein, Recital 17 of the \nCommission\u2019s initial AI Act proposal assumes that social scoring is done \u201cfor general purpose\u201d. \nThis has been removed in the final version of the AI Act  but the last sentence of the actual \nRecital 31 specifies that the ban does not affect lawful scoring carried out for a \u201cspecific \npurpose\u201d , implying a contrario  that scores that are not used for a specific purpose should be \nprohibited .63 \nHowever, the condition that the context of data collection is unrelated to the context in which \nthe score is used is not identical to the condition that the social score is carried out for  general -\npurpose. The former is arguably broader than the latter.   \nConsidering a score designed and used for a specific purpose such as credit scoring , what if the \ndata used to build a scoring system appeared very loosely related to creditworthiness? Could \nwe consider the data feeding the score to be unrelated to its context of application (i.e. granting \ncredit). Classic scores such SCHUFA scores are fed by information such as payment defaults, \nclaims, credit history, etc. which are all more or less related to credit. But  new forms of credit \nscoring include various source of information such as the time at which the credit application \nis submitted online or activity on social networks, a tendency well illustrated by the expression \n\u201call data is credit data \u201d.64 In this case, could it not be considered that the data fed into the score \nis \u201cunrelated to its context of application \u201d (i.e. the granting of credit), even though the score is \nused for a specific purpose?65 \nIn addition, scores are sometimes used for purposes beyond those for which they were originally \ndesigned. This is particularly true of credit scores produced by agencies such as Equifax, \nExperian, and TransUnion in countries like the United States, Canada,  and the United Kingdom. \nInitially, these scores were intended for banks assessing loan applicants. However, they soon \ncame to be consulted by landlords selecting tenants, employers hiring staff, and car insurance \ncompanies determining premiums.66 In Canada, credit scoring has been characterised as a \n \n63 This condition echoes the purpose limitation principle set out in Article 5(1)(b) of the GDPR which requires that \ndata must be \u201ccollected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that \nis incompatible with those purposes\u201d. However, we will not proceed to an exhaustive comparis on of these two \nprovisions in this Article . \n64 Rob Aitken, \u2018\u201cAll Data Is Credit Data \u201d: Constituting the Unbanked \u2019 (2017) 21 Competition & Change 274.  \n65 In its Guidelines on prohibited AI practices, the European Commission gives the example of a tax authority that \nwould take into account taxpayers\u2019 Internet connections to decide who to inspect, and considers that such practices \nwould fall within the scope of the p rohibition  (Guidelines on prohibited AI practices  (n 15) 57). \n66 Akos Rona -Tas, \u2018The Off -Label Use of Consumer Credit Ratings \u2019 (2017) 42 Historical Social Research / \nHistorische Sozialforschung 52.  \n\n16 \n \u201cparallel justice system\u201d , functioning as \u201ca default judgment, which is based solely on the \ncreditors\u2019 version of the facts\u201d and does not respect the general legal principle audi alteram \npartem .67 Once produced, a score can thus be used for purposes that were not initially intended \nby those who designed them, a phenomenon that sociologist Akos Rona -Tas calls the \u201coff -label\u201d \nuse of scores.68 \nCredit scores used in this way contribute to determining the destiny of individuals in different \ncontexts which are crucial to everyday life. More than just predictors of an individual \u2019s financial \nstability, they are used as true indicators of their personality, seriousness and integrity. In his \nhistory of creditworthiness, historian Josh Lauer emphasises this point. He explains that the \noverlap between traits such as creditworthiness, h ealth and employability reflected \u201can implicit \nunderstanding that credi tworthiness  \u2013 one\u2019s trustworthiness as a financial subject  \u2013 was \nconceptually linked to moral qualities involving one\u2019s lifestyle, reputation, physical fitness, and \nsocial conformity\u201d .69 From a legal perspective, should such use of credit scores for purposes \nother than granting loan take place in an EU Member State, it could be prohibited under Article \n5(1)(c) (i) of the AI Act  despite the fact that scoring system was not intended to be \u201csocial\u201d . The \nimportant point is thus that the intention that existed when producing the score is irrelevant, \nonly the practical consequences of the score matter. If a score happens to be bought and used \nby a company or public service  in a context other than the one in which it was originally \nproduced , it could qualify as a social score .70 \n4.2.3. The disproportionate punishment of a social behaviour  \nThe second alternative criterion relates to proportionality: a social score shall  also be prohibited \nif it leads to a detrimental or unfavourable treatment that is unjustified or disproportionate to \nthe social behaviour of the scored subject or its gravity. As already seen, the first paragraph of \nArticle 5(1)(c)  specifies that social scores are based on social behaviour, personality or personal \ncharacteristics , which are all very broad notions, encompassing almost all kinds of data . Here \nhowever, the focus is solely on social behaviour. Why is that? What seems to differentiate \n\u201csocial behaviour \u201d from personality of personal characteristics  is that the concept of behaviour \nrefers to an action on the part of  the subject . On the contrary, gender, age  or an IQ test result are \nconsidered personal attributes but not behavioural data. Roughly speaking, t hey tend to describe \nwhat the person is rather than what he or she does.71 Behaviour is something for which a person \n \n67 Vincent Caron, \u2018Le pr \u00e9judice de perte de solvabilit \u00e9 d\u00e9coulant d \u2019une inscription n \u00e9gative au dossier de cr \u00e9dit du \nconsommateur \u2019 (2021) 50 Revue g \u00e9n\u00e9rale de droit 445.  Our translation.  \n68 Rona -Tas (n 66).  \n69 Lauer (n 18) 172.  \n70 As already said, this use of a score could also violate the GDPR, in particular the purpose limitation principle. \nWe do not analyse this issue in more detail here, but it can be pointed out  that there are exceptions to this principle \n(notably those set out in Article 6(4)  of the GDPR ), while Article 5( 1)(c) of the AI Act  does not suffer any \nexceptions.  In addition, it should be noted that that the AI Act requires high -risk AI system s to specify their \n\u201cintended purpose\u201d  as well as the \u201creasonably foreseeable misuse\u201d ( i.e. the use of an AI system for another purpose \nthan its intended purpose ) (see definitions at  Article 3  (12) and (13)). The main requirement in this respect for the \nprovider is to minimise (through the risk management system and human oversight) the risk of a \u201creasonabl y \nforeseeable misuse\u201d. The use of a credit score to select new employees could possibly be considered as such a \nreasonabl y foreseeable misuse. However, such misuse is not prohibited per se , but the associated risks must be \nmitigated.  \n71 This distinction is of course far from clear -cut as it is often a daunting task to distinguish what is behavioural \nand what is not.  \n\n17 \n could be held responsible. And the fact that the provision also refers to the \u201cgravity\u201d of the \nbehaviour confirms this implicit view . It is as if the social  scoring system was designed to \nsanction individuals for their bad behaviours. Given that the Chinese scoring system inspired \nthe drafters of the AI Act, this is not surprising since the ambition of the Chinese system is \nindeed to make the behaviour of Chinese citizens more virtuous. For example, in the social \ncredit system project proposed by the city o f Changsha, actions such as volunteering with the \nCommunist Youth League, donating to the Chinese Red Cross or giving blood increase your \nscore; while actions such as not paying your employees\u2019 wages , being convicted of a crime or \ncommitting traffic violations make you lose points .72 \nIn Western countries, the system which is the close st to this idea of attributing points in relation \nto the good or bad behaviour of citizens is probably points -based driving licences: each driver \nloses points every time he or she infringes a traffic rule, which can ultimately lead to the \nwithdrawal of the driving licence73. However, if we think of AI -enabled scoring, the idea that \nthe variables influencing the score should be proportionate to the consequences resulting from \nthe score sounds incongruous . AI developers would probably argue that s coring is not about \npunishing or rewarding someone for their good or bad actions, but about looking for attributes \nthat can statistically predict unknown traits  in order to improve decision -making process es. As \ndiscussed above, r ecent years have seen the emergence  of new forms of scoring that take into \naccount alternative data such as the time spent in readi ng the terms and conditions  or the \nnetwork of telephone contacts .74 Is this proportionate to the \u201cgravity \u201d of the \u201cbehaviour \u201d of the \nscore d subject? Is it really justified and proportionate to deny someone access to credit because \nthey are related to \u201cbad borrowers\u201d ?75 The way out for a bank taking into account such variable \nwould  probably  be, first, to invoke the statistical validity of its model  \u2013 if these criteria are right, \nit\u2019s because  the data is correct and effectively predicts the risk  \u2013, and second to argue  that it is \nonly one variable among others that feed the model .  \nIn any case, just as the criterion relating to the multiplicity of contexts of application, this \ncondition is broad and makes it possible to tackle scoring practices which, even if they would \nnot immediately be associated with social scoring, would nonetheless appear disproportionate.  \n \n72 Ars\u00e8ne (n 8) LXV .  \n73 In some systems, drivers do not lose points but accumulate them each time they commit a traffic offence ( See \nJos\u00e9 I Castillo -Manzano and Mercedes Castro -Nu\u00f1o, \u2018Driving Licenses Based on Points Systems: Efficient Road \nSafety Strategy or Latest Fashion in Global Transport Policy? A Worldwide Meta -Analysis\u2019 (2012) 21 Transport \nPolicy 191).  It is worth noting that the behaviours penalised are prohibited by traffic regulations, whereas the \nChinese system also rewards actions that are not compulsory but only considered virtuous.  \n74 Mar\u00eda \u00d3skarsd \u00f3ttir and others, \u2018The Value of Big Data for Credit Scoring: Enhancing Financial Inclusion Using \nMobile Phone Data and Social Network Analytics \u2019 (2019) 74 Applied Soft Computing 26; Robinson + Yu, \n\u2018Knowing the Score: New Data, Underwriting, and Marketing in the Consumer Credit Marketplace.

Conclusion : a new tool to protect the scored subject?  \nWill European citizens be scored differently with the entry into force of the AI Act? The \nintuition that triggered the writing of this article is that the ban on social scoring is perceived \nmainly as a rule with little effect, adopted solely to avoid falling into a kind of authoritarian \ndrift and which will not affect existing scoring practices. It \u2019s as if we had two types of scoring: \non the one hand, scoring practices which already exist in Europe and certainly raise fundamental \nrights concerns, but which should nevertheless be promoted as long as they remain in line with \nthe \u201chuman -centric and trus tworthy approach to AI\u201d that has been promoted by the EU ;76 on \nthe other, a potential totalitarian scoring system that exerts harsh control over citizens by \nmonitoring their most trivial behaviour and deciding every aspect of their lives. The analysis \ncarried out in this article shows, however, that things are mor e complex, as the boundary \nbetween social scoring as defined in the AI Act and other lawful forms of scoring is far from \nsharp.  \nAs has been demonstrated, the \u201csocial\u201d nature of a social score within the meaning of Article \n5(1)(c) is context dependant: it may become social because of how it is used. A social score can \nof course be produced by an AI system that is itself designed as a \u201csocial scoring system\u201d, i.e. \na system which would be conceived from the outset to assess individuals in the light of various \ndata and for different purposes. But the ecosystem of data and scores is such that data is \ncollected, sold and transformed into scores, and the scores themselves are sold to third parties. \nIn this sense, a score \u2013 for example, a credit score \u2013 can individually become a social score \nbecause it has been used in a way that qualifies it as \u201csocial\u201d under the AI Act. In this regard, it \nis of great importance that Article 5(1)(c) does not ban social scoring systems , but only social \nscores. This finding echoes the conclusions of the CJEU in the SCHUFA Holding AG Case  in \nwhich the Court stated that the score sold by SCHUFA was itself an aut omated decision because \nit played a decisive role in refusing to grant credit to the applicant. Even if the SCHUFA scoring \nsystem is not an automated decision -making system (since the scores do not necessarily involve \na decision), the SCHUFA score was fina lly qualified as an automated decision (because of the \ninfluence of the score on the final refusal of credit in this case ). Similarly, even if the SCHUFA \nscoring system (or any other consumer credit agency) is not a social  scoring system, a SCHUFA \nscore co uld qualify as a social score if it were used by a third -party in a different context than \nthat of credit.  \nIn addition, the ban on social scoring may also concern scores that are used for a specific \npurpose and in a limited context. Indeed, although Recital 31 states that lawful evaluation of \nindividuals carried out for a  specific purpose are not affected by th is prohibition, the wording \nof Article 5(1)(c)(ii) specifies that a score shall be prohibited if the treatment resulting from this \nscore is disproportionate or unjustified with regard to the social behaviour or its gravity. \nNothing here prevents a score th at is used for a specific purpose, but which appears \ndisproportionate of unjustified from constituting a social score.  \nIn light of this, the ban on social scoring appears to be a complementary tool to the ban on \nautomated decisions introduced by Article 22 of the GDPR.  Some practices that are not \n \n76 For a critique of this a pproach: Derave, Genicot and Hetmanska (n 21).  \n\n19 \n prohibited under Article 22 of the GDPR are now banned under Article 5(1)(c) (and, conversely , \nother practices that were already prohibited by Article 22 of the GDPR will remain so).77 In \nsome respects, Article 22 of the GDPR is broader in scope: it covers  automated decisions ( based  \non personal data) , whereas Article 5 (1)(c) covers AI-based scoring. Many scores are indeed not \nbased on AI, especially as the AI Act\u2019s definition of AI system s requires them to operate with \nvarying levels of autonomy  and to show a daptiveness after deployment , which tends to narrow \nthe scope of application of the AI Act.78 In addition, Article 22 prohibits any automated scoring \nthat leads to decisions producing legal or significant effects, whereas Article 5(1)(c) of the AI \nAct only prohibits AI -based scoring to the extent that the resulting detrimental treatment occurs \nin a different context or is disproportionate. However, the AI Act\u2019s ban on social scoring appears \nbroader in one key aspect: unlike the GDPR\u2019s prohibition on automated decisions, it allows for \nno exceptions. While Article 22(2) of the GDPR permits automated decisions under certain \nconditions  \u2013 when necessary for entering into a contract, when authori sed by Member State \nlaw, or when based on the explicit consent of the data subject  \u2013, the ban on social scoring is \nabsolute . \nFrom a fundamental rights perspective, the crucial point is therefore that the ban on social \nscoring confer a strict right on individuals to be protected against practices that may infringe \ntheir rights and be potentially harmful. In contrast, the safeguar ds put in place for high -risk AI \nsystems are more vague and imprecise, as it is up to the providers and deployers  of these \nsystems to mitigate the risks they have identified themselves. The ban on social scoring could \nthen be used to challenge the legality  of common AI -enabled scoring techniques. When faced \nwith an AI -enabled score, the question will arise as to the context in which the data was \ncollected and the score produced, as well as the relationship of proportionality and necessity \nbetween the behavi our of the scored subject and the possible consequences of the score. It now \nremains to be seen whether the courts will be willing to embrace such a proactive interpretation \nof the ban on social scoring. The future will tell.  \n \n77 In this regard, Article 2(7) of t he AI Act states that the AI Act shall not affect EU data protection law (including \nthe GDPR). However, this obviously does not mean that it cannot prohibit practices which are not already \nprohibited under EU data protection law (otherwise there would no point in banning such p ractices). The European \nCommission confirms this in its Guidelines on prohibited AI practices : \u201c[The AI Act] provides additional \nprotection by addressing specific harmful AI practices which may not be prohibited by other [EU] laws. (\u2026) At \nthe same time, the AI Act does not affect prohibitions that apply where an AI practice falls within other Union law. \nThus, even where an AI system is not prohibited by the AI Act, its use could still be prohibited or unlawful based \non other primary or s econdary Union law  (Guidelines on prohibited AI practices  (n 15) 14, para 42 -43).  \n78 Article 3(1) of the AI Act.

The Fetal Brain Tissue Annotation (FeTA) Challenge 2024\nbuilds upon previous editions to further advance the clinical relevance and robustness\nof automated fetal brain MRI analysis. This year\u2019s challenge introduced biometry\nprediction as a new task complementing the usual segmentation task. The segmen-\ntation task also included a new low-field (0.55T) MRI testing set and used Euler\ncharacteristic difference (ED) as a topology-aware metric for ranking, extending the\ntraditional overlap or distance-based measures.\nA total of 16 teams submitted segmentation methods for evaluation. Segmenta-\ntion performance across top teams was highly consistent across both standard and\nlow-field MRI data. Longitudinal analysis over past FeTA editions revealed mini-\nmal improvement in accuracy over time, suggesting a potential performance plateau,\nparticularly as results now approach or surpass reported levels of inter-rater variabil-\nity. However, the introduction of the ED metric revealed topological differences that\nwere not captured by conventional metrics, underscoring its value in assessing seg-\nmentation quality. Notably, the curated low-field MRI dataset achieved the highest\nsegmentation performance, illustrating the potential of affordable imaging systems\nwhen combined with high-quality preprocessing and reconstruction.\nA total of 7 teams submitted automated biometry methods for evaluation. While\npromising, this task exposed a critical limitation: most submitted methods failed\nto outperform a simple baseline that predicted measurements based solely on gesta-\ntional age, without using image data. Performance varied widely across biometric\nmeasurements and between teams, indicating both current challenges and opportu-\nnities for improvement in this area. These findings highlight the need for better\nintegration of volumetric context and stronger modeling strategies needed for the\nclinical adoption of automated fetal biometry estimation.\nIn addition, we analyzed different dimensions of domain shifts within our data\n3\n\nand observed that image quality was the most influential factor affecting model\ngeneralization, with Dice score differences of up to 0.10 between low- and high-\nquality scans. The choice of super-resolution reconstruction pipeline also had a\nsubstantial impact on segmentation performance. Other factors\u2014such as gestational\nage, pathology, and acquisition site\u2014also contributed to performance variability, but\ntheir effects were comparatively smaller.\nOverall, FeTA 2024 provides a rigorous, multi-faceted benchmark for evaluating\nmulti-class segmentation and biometry estimation in fetal brain MRI. It emphasizes\nthe need for data-centric approaches, improved topological modeling, and greater\ndataset diversity to develop clinically reliable and generalizable AI tools for fetal\nneuroimaging.\nKeywords: Fetal Brain, MRI, Low-field, Segmentation, Topology, Biometry,\nDomain Shift, Challenge results\n\u2020Equal contributions.\n1. Introduction\nThe fetal brain undergoes rapid and complex development throughout gestation,\ninfluenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Understanding this dynamic\nprocess is critical in both clinical and research domains, as neurodevelopmental dis-\nruptions are linked to congenital anomalies and long-term cognitive or physiological\nimpairments (Griffiths et al., 2017; Ciceri et al., 2024; Van den Bergh et al., 2018). In\nvivo imaging biomarkers derived from ultrasonography (US) or magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) provide non-invasive and quantifiable metrics to monitor prenatal\nbrain development. Deviations from normative patterns in these biomarkers have\nbeen associated with a range of pathologies, including corpus callosum (Marathu\net al., 2024; Lamon et al., 2024) and posterior fossa malformations (Dovjak et al.,\n2020; Mahalingam et al., 2021), ventriculomegaly (Chen et al., 2024), and have been\nshown to correlate with neurodevelopmental outcomes in conditions such as congen-\nital heart disease (Sadhwani et al., 2022), intrauterine growth restriction (Ega\u02dc na-\nUgrinovic et al., 2015; Meijerink et al., 2023), and preterm birth (Story et al., 2021;\nHall et al., 2024).\nFetal brain MRI has emerged as an important non-invasive tool for studying\nneurodevelopment in utero and diagnosing congenital disorders, complementing ul-\ntrasonography (Griffiths et al., 2017; Alamo et al., 2010). Accurate and automatic\nsegmentation of fetal brain tissues in MRI is critical for quantitative analysis and\nbiomarker extraction, including tissue volumetry, cortical morphometry (Payette\n4\n\net al., 2023), and biometric measurements (She et al., 2023). Manual segmenta-\ntion, however, remains labor-intensive, error-prone, and susceptible to inter-observer\nvariability, underscoring the necessity of reliable automated techniques.\nWhile clinical US and 2D MRI are the standard techniques for assessing fetal\ndevelopment (Tilea et al., 2009), the use of super-resolution reconstruction (SRR)\ntechniques to generate 3D fetal brain reconstructions has emerged as a powerful\nadvancement. SRR methods fuse multiple 2D MRI slices (often motion-corrupted)\ninto a single, enhanced 3D motion-corrected volume, significantly improving brain\nanalysis (Gafner et al., 2020; Avisdris et al., 2021; Matthew et al., 2024). Recent\nstudies have shown that biometric measurements derived from 3D SRR volumes\ncorrelate strongly with those from ultrasound, while offering greater rater confidence\nthan using 2D MRI series (Lamon et al., 2024; Khawam et al., 2021; Gafner et al.,\n2020; Sanchez et al., 2024b; Kyriakopoulou et al., 2016; Ciceri et al., 2023).\nThe Fetal Tissue Annotation (FeTA) challenges, held in 2021 (Payette et al., 2023)\nand 2022 (Payette et al., 2024), have significantly advanced fetal brain MRI analysis\nby providing public datasets and standardized evaluation protocols for brain tissue\nsegmentation. The FeTA 2024 challenge builds on previous editions, retaining\nthe core brain tissue segmentation task and introducing a new clinically relevant\nobjective: biometry extraction , alongside several other key innovations.\nFirstly, FeTA 2024 introduces a new low-field (LF, 0.55T) MRI testing dataset.\nLF MRI offers a low-cost alternative to 1.5\u20133T systems, making it especially valuable\nin resource-limited settings (Arnold et al., 2023; Marques et al., 2019). This afford-\nability supports research in low- and middle-income countries with large pediatric\npopulations, where access to high-field MRI is limited, hindering studies on brain de-\nvelopment under normal and adverse conditions (Murali et al., 2023; Aviles Verdera\net al., 2023).\nSecondly, we introduced the Euler characteristic difference as an additional rank-\ning metric for segmentation (Taha and Hanbury, 2015). Unlike overlap- or distance-\nbased metrics, it captures topological correctness, offering a complementary view of\nperformance (Maier-Hein et al., 2024). This is especially relevant for downstream\ntasks like cortical surface extraction or morphometric analyses (e.g., sulcal fold-\ning, cortical maturation, or structural abnormality assessment) (Yehuda et al., 2023;\nClouchoux et al., 2011).\nIn FeTA 2024, we promote the development of generalizable, fully automated\nmethods for fetal brain analysis, enabling the extraction of key imaging biomark-\ners via multi-class tissue segmentation and biometry across diverse acquisition and\nreconstruction settings. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of the\nchallenge , covering its organization, submitted algorithms, performance assessment,\n5\n\nbenchmarking, and evaluation using the BIAS reporting framework, which empha-\nsizes transparency, reproducibility, and fairness (Maier-Hein et al., 2020). We also\nanalyze performance trends over time, tracking improvements in state-of-the-art seg-\nmentation accuracy across FeTA editions. Finally, we assess data quality in both\ntraining and testing sets to examine its impact on the generalization of submit-\nted methods. Combined with other domain shifts\u2014such as gestational age, pathol-\nogy, super-resolution reconstruction, and acquisition site\u2014our work provides a deep\noverview of how domain shifts affect deep learning models for fetal brain\nanalysis and informs strategies to mitigate their impact.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Challenge organization\nContext. The FeTA 2024 challenge was held as a thematic event within the Peri-\nnatal, Preterm, and Pediatric Image Analysis (PIPPI) workshop2, part of the Med-\nical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2024 con-\nference. The challenge was run through a custom platform, available at https:\n//fetachallenge.github.io/ , which provided participants with all the necessary\ninformation on the organization, time frame, and submission instructions.\nData, participation and submission. Challenge participation required submission of\nfully automated segmentation and/or biometry algorithms. A training set of 3D\nsuper-resolution fetal brain MRI from two institutions was provided; no validation\nset was released, and test data remained private for evaluation. Participants could\nuse publicly available external datasets and pre-trained models, provided these were\npublic and fully documented in the algorithm description, as well as use both 2D\nand 3D models.\nParticipants submitted their algorithms as Docker containers with a command-\nline interface for test data evaluation3. Any programming language was allowed,\nprovided the input/output followed the evaluation utility specifications. Each team\nwas allowed one submission, except in cases of technical errors (e.g., Docker is-\nsues), which could be corrected upon notification by the organizers. Evaluation on\ntest data was performed by the organizers using publicly available code4. To pro-\nmote transparency and reproducibility, FeTA 2024 encouraged participants to share\n2https://pippiworkshop.github.io/\n3Instructions: https://github.com/fetachallenge/fetachallengesubmission .\n4Available at https://fetachallenge.github.io/pages/Evaluation .\n6\n\ntheir code publicly. A Docker Hub page ( https://hub.docker.com/repositories/\nfetachallenge2024 ) was created to host containers from teams who agreed to re-\nlease their Docker images.\nTimetable, rewards and results paper. The challenge followed a predefined schedule:\ntraining data was released on May 21, 2024; registration opened after challenge\nacceptance. The Docker submission deadline was extended to August 4, 2024, and\nalgorithm descriptions were due by August 12. On August 23, the top five teams were\ninvited to prepare 2-minute pitch presentations for the challenge day and, along with\nall participants, were invited to present posters at the dedicated conference session.\nThe challenge took place in person on October 6, 2024, during MICCAI. Results\nwere announced live and later published on the challenge website, along with top\nteams\u2019 presentations (with their consent). The top three teams in each task received\ncertificates and small gifts, including a 3D-printed fetal brain keychain for in-person\nattendees. The highest-ranking team in each task also received a box of artisanal\nSwiss-made cookies. Organizers could participate but were not eligible for awards.\nAll teams with valid submissions and interest in the publication were included in\nthis results paper, with up to three members per team listed as co-authors. Teams\nwere free to publish their algorithms and results independently after the challenge,\nwithout embargo, provided they cited both the data publication (Payette et al., 2021)\nand this summary paper.\nData usage terms and conflicts of interest. The training data from the University\nChildren\u2019s Hospital Z\u00a8 urich ( Kispi ) and General Hospital Vienna/Medical University\nof Vienna were provided with specific licensing conditions. Kispi data, hosted on the\nSynapse platform5,is for non-commercial use only .Vienna data is governed by\na custom Data Transfer Agreement, allowing use for challenge purposes only .\nParticipants could modify the data, including generating synthetic data through\naugmentation, as long as modifications were documented and synthetic data could\nbe provided to the organizers upon request. None of the organizers participated in\nthis year\u2019s challenge or have conflicts of interest to disclose. The challenge awards\nwere funded by the institutional budget (Kispi), and none of the participants were\ninvolved in funding. Only organizers at Kispi had full access to the testing dataset,\nas they managed data transfer agreements with all providers.\n5https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn25649159/wiki/610007\n7\n\n2.2. Challenge tasks\nThe FeTA challenge presents two primary tasks (see Figure 1). Participants could\nchoose to compete in either or both tasks.\nTask 1. Fetal brain tissue segmentation .This task aims to develop algorithms\nthat automatically delineate different tissues in SRR fetal brain MRI. The 3D seman-\ntic segmentation involves classifying each voxel into one of seven predefined classes:\nBackground, External CSF, Grey Matter (GM), White Matter (WM), Ventricles in-\ncluding cavum (VM), Cerebellum (CBM), Deep Grey Matter (SGM), and Brainstem\n(BSM). Reference annotation procedures and inter-rater variability analyses for all\ndatasets (except the new LF set) are detailed in Payette et al. (2021) and Payette\net al. (2024). The LF dataset followed the same annotation protocol, with seven\nannotators (AJ, CS, RG, VZ, YG, MA, MR) each segmenting a specific label map.\nThese were merged into a single reference annotation, reviewed, and corrected by\ntwo fetal MRI experts (KP, AJ).\nTask 2. Biometric measurements prediction .The goal of this task is to\ndevelop algorithms that automatically and accurately estimate key fetal brain biom-\netry from MRI. The selected measurements\u2014length of the corpus callosum (LCC),\nheight of the vermis (HV), brain biparietal diameter (bBIP), skull biparietal diam-\neter (sBIP), and transverse cerebellar diameter (TCD)\u2014were chosen to minimize\nannotation burden while providing complementary anatomical and diagnos-\ntic value . Four raters contributed: YG (5 years\u2019 fetal MRI experience), MKo (16\nyears), and junior raters RG and MA (reviewed by AJ, 12 years)6. Not all measure-\nments were available for all cases: in the test set, 15 cases lacked LCC, one lacked\nHV, and one lacked TCD due to annotator uncertainty. In the training set, 102 of\n120 cases had complete annotations\u201410 Kispi cases were excluded for poor qual-\nity; 5 Kispi and 3 Vienna cases had partial annotations. While the main goal was\nto predict biometry values, the training set also included 3D landmark annota-\ntions \u2014single-voxel labels marking anatomical structures used to derive each mea-\nsurement. Clinicians identified these landmarks during annotation, and the actual\nbiometry values were computed via organizer-provided scripts. Both the landmarks\nand scripts were shared, allowing participants to either regress biometry directly or\npredict landmarks, followed by automated biometry measurement.\n6Biometry annotation protocol is described on our website: https://fetachallenge.github.\nio/pages/Data description\n8\n\nTask 1 \nBrain tissue \nsegmentation \nTask 2 \nBiometry \nestimation \nCSF\nWM\nGM\nVM\nSGM \nCBM \nBSM \nsBIP: 55.77mm \nbBIP: 49.09mm LCC: 24.4mm HV: 14.98mm TCD: 21.97mm \nTask 1 \nBrain tissue \nsegmentation \nTask 2 \nBiometry \nestimation \nCSF\nWM\nGM\nVM\nSGM \nCBM \nBSM \nsBIP: 55.77mm \nbBIP: 49.09mm LCC: 24.4mm HV: 14.98mm TCD: 21.97mm \nFigure 1: FeTA 2024 Challenge Tasks. Task 1 involves segmentation of fetal brain tissues into\nseven classes, while Task 2 focuses on estimating five biometric measurements, both illustrated in\nthe figure.\n2.3. Challenge data sets\nSubject selection aimed to ensure a representative cohort spanning 18\u201335 weeks\nof gestation, including both neurotypical and pathological cases (e.g., spina bifida,\nventriculomegaly, corpus callosum malformations) to reflect clinical practice. UCSF\nand CHUV data were acquired during clinical fetal MRI scans following ultrasound\nreferral, performed by trained medical staff. Data from KCL, Kispi, and Vienna\nwere collected using research protocols. All cohorts had approval by the local ethics\ncommittee for use in the challenge after anonymization7.\nEach case included a 3D fetal brain MRI reconstruction, manual brain tissue seg-\nmentation, and biometry annotations. Metadata included gestational age (GA) and\na binary label indicating neurotypical or pathological status. To preserve anonymity,\ngender was excluded and GA was randomly offset by \u00b13 days.\nThe challenge dataset comprises of 120 training and 180 test cases. The test set\nwas split into in-domain (from the same institutions and protocols as training data)\nandout-of-domain cases. To ensure balance, both subsets were similar in size to the\ntraining set.

(2024a), ensuring comparable data quality\nbetween training and testing sets (Figure 2).\nThe FeTA 2024 training and testing datasets are identical to those used in FeTA\n2022, with two additions: a new low-field out-of-domain test set from King\u2019s College\nLondon (KCL) and manual biometry annotations.\nAll cases were acquired using T2-weighted single-shot fast spin-echo sequences8,\nthe standard for structural fetal MRI due to their high signal-to-noise ratio and\nreduced sensitivity to fetal motion. To further mitigate motion artifacts, multiple\nstacks were acquired in various orientations (axial, sagittal, coronal, and off-plane).\nManual selection of 2D stacks was done at each site and then combined into a single\nhigh-resolution, isotropic 3D image via super-resolution reconstruction.

Therefore, the breakdown of number of cases per\nscanner is not provided here.\ning 3D volumes were zero-padded to 256x256x256 and reoriented to a standard radi-\nological plane. A summary of acquisition parameters, demographic characteristics,\nand reconstruction methods in all sites is provided in Table 1. Additional details\nabout the new KCL dataset are provided below. For further detailed information on\nthe FeTA 2022 acquisitions, please refer to Payette et al. (2024).\nData from KCL was collected using a 0.55T low-field MRI scanner (Siemens\nMAGNETOM Free.Max) with a HASTE sequence as part of a prospective single-\ncenter study and fully anonymized following local procedures (Ethics Committee\nDulwich 19 LO 0852). The acquired stacks had a resolution of 1.5mm x 1.5mm\nx 4.5mm, which were then reconstructed into a high-resolution volume of 0.8mm x\n0.8mm x 0.8mm using SVRTK (Uus et al., 2020). Key acquisition parameters include\na flip angle of 180 \u00b0, a field-of-view of 450 \u00d7450mm \u00b2, and a base resolution of 304x304\npixels, yielding a voxel size of 1.5 \u00d71.5\u00d74.5mm \u00b3. The acquisition time ranged from\n64 to 122 seconds. Data collection took place at St Thomas\u2019 Hospital in London,\nUnited Kingdom, without the use of maternal or fetal sedation. All acquisitions were\nperformed using the contour L coil and the integrated spine coil while the mother\nwas in a supine position. This dataset is used only in the testing set.\n2.4. Evaluation Metrics\nWe provide a short recall of the ranking metrics. The detailed mathematical\nformulation is available in supplementary materials A1.\n11\n\nTask 1. Segmentation. Performance of segmentation algorithms is comprehensively\nassessed through complementary metrics of spatial overlap, volume, shape, and topo-\nlogical correctness:\n\u2022Dice Similarity Coefficient (Dice; \u2191)9:measures voxel-wise correspondence\nbetween the predicted and ground truth (GT) segmentations.\n\u2022Volume Similarity (VS; \u2191):measures the similarity of the volumes between\nthe predicted and GT segmentations.\n\u2022Hausdorff Distance (HD95; \u2193):quantifies the distance between contours\nof the predicted and GT segmentations with robustness to outliers.\n\u2022Euler Characteristics Difference (ED; \u2193): evaluates the topological simi-\nlarity between the predicted and GT segmentations.\nAs ED is included in the ranking for the first time, we describe it further. It is based\non the Euler characteristic (EC):\nEC= BN 0\u2212BN1+ BN 2\nwhere Betti Number BN 0represents the number of connected components (i.e., re-\ngions), BN 1represents the number of loops or holes and BN 2represents the number\nof voids or cavities. The ED difference is then computed as |ECpred\u2212ECGT|. Smaller\ndifferences indicate better topological alignment. The Betti number values of GT are:\nfor all brain tissue labels, BN 1= 0 and BN 2= 0. For the eCSF, WM, ventricles,\ncerebellum, dGM, and brainstem, BN 0= 1, while for GM, BN 0= 2.\nTask 2: Biometry Estimation. The primary metric for evaluating biometry estima-\ntion algorithms is mean average percentage error (MAPE; \u2193), which quantifies\nthe error in the estimated biometric measurements relative to the actual measure-\nments:\nMAPE =1\nNNX\ni=1|yi\u2212\u02c6yi|\nyi\u00d7100,\nwhere yiand \u02c6yiare GT and predicted measurements respectively, and Nis the total\nnumber of measurements. This metric accounts for variable sizes of the target struc-\ntures and is used to assess the accuracy of the estimated biometric measurements.\n9\u2191means that a higher score is better and \u2193that a lower score is better\n12\n\n2.5. Ranking\nSubmissions are ranked based on metrics computed for each brain tissue label\n(or biometric measurement) in the predicted maps of the fetal brain volumes. For\nsegmentation, the final rank is the average of all 4 metrics: Dice, HD95, VS, and\nED. For biometry, the final rank is based on MAPE. For metrics where higher values\nare better (Dice, VS), the algorithm with the highest value ranks best. For metrics\nwhere lower values are better (like HD95 and ED for segmentation and MAPE for\nbiometry tasks), the algorithm with the lowest value ranks best. The individual\nlabel rankings are summed, and the algorithm with the highest combined rank is\nconsidered the best.\nIn cases of missing results (e.g., if an algorithm fails to detect a label or if the\nentire label map is empty), the worst possible values will be assigned to the algorithm.\nFor example, if a label is missing in the label map, it will receive a Dice and VS of 0.\nFor HD95, EC, and MAPE, the missing values are set to double the maximum value\nof other algorithms for that sub-ranking. This ensures that algorithms with missing\nresults are ranked last for that specific task/brain tissue.\n2.5.1. Biometry baselines\nIn the ranking of Task 2, two additional baseline models representing lower and\nupper performance limits were incorporated as separate submissions. These entries,\nintended solely for benchmarking purposes, were not considered in the formal deter-\nmination of the challenge competition ranking.\nLower bound: Gestational age regression model. This model , referred to as [GA]\nin the result\u2019s Table 5, is a simple univariate linear regression baseline. For each\nbiometric measurement y, the model predicts its value \u02c6 yusing the gestational age\n(GA) as the sole explanatory variable, mathematically:\n\u02c6y=\u03b20+\u03b21\u00b7GA,\nwhere \u03b20is the intercept and \u03b21is the regression coefficient learned from the training\ndata. This baseline does not rely on the image and aims at quantifying how strongly\nthe GA can account for the size of a given structure.\nUpper bound: Inter-rater variability. The upper bound is set by averaging inter-rater\nvariability, further denoted as [inter-rater] . This reflects the best-expected accu-\nracy, accounting for measurement errors and uncertainties between manual raters.\nFor each biometric measurement in the test dataset, annotations from two indepen-\ndent observers are used by comparing one observer\u2019s measurement to the other\u2019s,\nwith the result averaged across all test cases.\n13\n\n2.6. Statistical analysis\nThe non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess performance\ndifferences between algorithms, as the Shapiro-Wilk test indicated non-normal dis-\ntribution. To evaluate performance differences across subsets (e.g., neurotypical vs.\npathological cohorts), we applied the Mann-Whitney U test (Wilcoxon rank-sum\ntest). For all tests, statistical significance was set at p <0.05. For multiple compar-\nisons, such as between sites or labels, we applied Bonferroni correction .\n2.7. Further analysis\nFeTA 2024, as the third edition of the challenge, provides an opportunity to\nassess progress and unsolved challenges. We report two additional analyses: (i)the\nevolution of top-performing segmentation models over the last three editions, and\n(ii)the impact of different domain shift sources on model performance.\n2.7.1. Insights from three years of competition: progress or plateau?\nTo assess progress in fetal brain tissue segmentation, we analyze the evolution of\ntop-performing algorithms over time. Specifically, we compare the performance of the\nhighest-ranked teams from the FeTA challenges in 2021, 2022, and 2024, evaluating\nsegmentation accuracy across the dataset splits available in each respective year.\nTo extend the longitudinal comparison, we perform a retrospective evaluation\nof the 2022 winning method on the KCL dataset, first introduced as a test set in\n2024. This is enabled by the 2022 winning team\u2019s release of their Docker container10,\nallowing us to assess the generalization of a previously state-of-the-art solution to\nnew, unseen data, and to identify both progress and persistent limitations.\n2.7.2. Quantifying domain shifts\nDomain shifts remain a key obstacle in fetal brain MRI analysis, often undermin-\ning model generalizability. These shifts arise from variations in subject demograph-\nics, imaging protocols, scanner types, and reconstruction methods (Dock` es et al.,\n2021). In fetal imaging, GA notably affects brain morphology and contrast, while\npathologies such as ventriculomegaly, for example, can significantly alter anatomical\nstructure. Beyond biological and acquisition-related variability, low contrast or mo-\ntion artifacts can degrade reconstruction quality, adversely affecting segmentation\nand biometry.\n10https://hub.docker.com/r/fetachallenge22/feta-imperial-tum-2022-nnunet\n14\n\nCondition \n Site\n        VIEN \nSRR \nMIAL \nSRTK \n                \nGestational Age \n Data Quality \n18w                              35w \n0           1                         4 \nbad excellent pass \nCHUV KISPI IRTK NiftyMIC Neurotypical               Pathological KCLSVRTK \n UCSF Figure 3: Illustration of the sources of domain shifts in fetal brain MRI datasets of FeTA 2024.\nDemonstrated across gestational age (18 vs. 35 weeks), data quality (0.9 vs. 3.64), clinical condition\n(neurotypical vs. pathological), acquisition site (KISPI vs. CHUV), and SRR methods (IRTK vs.\nNiftyMIC). In each comparison, only the indicated domain is varied, while all other domains remain\nconstant. Additional domains within each source, not shown here, are represented by circles.\nIs image quality a domain in itself? To assess whether image quality impacts model\ngeneralization, we manually rated the quality of all 180 test volumes using the pro-\ntocol from Sanchez et al. (2024a) and explored the interaction of data quality with\nthe performance of the submitted algorithms across the test data.\nComparing the impact of domain shift factors. To assess how domain shifts influence\nsegmentation performance, we examine six key sources of variability: image quality,\nGA, condition (neurotypical or pathological), acquisition site, testing domain (seen\nvs. unseen during training), and the SRR method. These factors are summarized\nin Figure 3. To evaluate the influence of domain shift factors on segmentation per-\nformance, we trained a random forest regressor for each metric of interest (Dice,\nHD95, Volume Similarity, Euler Difference), using six dataset-level variables as in-\nput features. Target values were defined as the average metric scores across the top\n3 teams. To estimate feature importance, we applied SHapley Additive exPlana-\ntions (SHAP) (Lundberg and Lee, 2017), which quantify the contribution of each\nfeature by computing its average marginal effect across all possible feature combina-\ntions. This approach provides a unified and interpretable measure of how each factor\naffects performance.\n15\n\n3. Results\n3.1. Algorithm description\nWe received 176 access requests for the KISPI training cohort hosted on Synapse\nduring the challenge active period (May\u2013July 2024). However, not all of these re-\nquests were related to the FeTA challenge, as the dataset is also available for broader\nresearch purposes. For the Vienna dataset, 53 data access applications were sub-\nmitted, but only 30 applicants completed the data transfer agreement process and\nsuccessfully received the data.\nFor the segmentation task, we received 16 valid submissions, all evaluated on the\nfull test set. One team declined participation in this paper and was excluded from the\nanalysis; results from the remaining 15 teams are presented. For the biometry task, 7\nteams submitted results. One team ( falcons ) failed to generate valid outputs for all\ntest cases and was penalized accordingly, as described in the Section 2.5. Notably, all\nbiometry participants also submitted segmentation entries, leveraging segmentation\noutputs either as a preprocessing step or direct input for biometry estimation. A\ndetailed description of each algorithm is provided in the supplementary materials\n(appendix A2) and summarized in Tables 2 and 3.\n3.1.1. Common data and model augmentation strategies\nParticipants adopted a variety of approaches, with the majority utilizing 3D\narchitectures\u201414 out of 16 for the segmentation task and 6 out of 7 for the biometry\ntask. Across both tasks, two strategies were commonly used: data augmentation\nand model ensembling.\nData augmentation was universally applied, with all segmentation (16 teams)\nand biometry (7 teams) models using it. Standard transformations like flipping,\nrotation, scaling, and intensity shifts were common, while advanced methods, such\nas SynthSeg (Billot et al., 2023) or global intensity non-linear augmentations (GIN)\n(Ouyang et al., 2022), were used by 3 teams. Some teams also simulated domain-\nspecific artifacts, including fetal motion and bias field.\nEnsembling was a key approach in segmentation, used by 14 out of 16 teams.\nThis included combining models trained on different cross-validation splits (4 teams)\nor using varied architectures, training setups, data orientations, or augmentation\nschemes (8 teams). Some also integrated pre- or post-processing models, like de-\nnoising autoencoders or skull-stripping (2 teams). Ensembling was less common in\nthe biometry task, with only 2 out of 7 teams employing it, as most models built\nbiometry predictions in a single pipeline on top of segmentation outputs.\n16\n\n3.1.2. Segmentation models\nAmong the 16 submissions, the most common architectures were nnU-Net Isensee\net al. (2018) (9 teams) and U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015; C \u00b8i\u00b8 cek et al., 2016) (6\nteams), often used as baselines. Many teams enhanced these models with atten-\ntion mechanisms (Vaswani, 2017), residual connections (He et al., 2016), or\nensembling . Others explored alternatives such as Swin Transformers (Liu et al.,\n2021), custom U-Net variants, or hybrid CNN\u2013Transformer designs. Most models\nwere developed in PyTorch (12 teams), with parameter counts ranging from 5M to\n140M (median: 31M, mean: 44.8M).\nUse of external data was limited to 5 teams, primarily leveraging dHCP data\n(Hughes et al., 2016; Edwards et al., 2022), fetal brain atlases (Gholipour et al., 2017;\nUus et al., 2023a), or foundation models pretrained on large-scale image datasets\n(Roy et al., 2023).\n3.1.3. Biometry models\nAll biometry models leveraged segmentation outputs, either as pre-processing,\nauxiliary, or core input. Two teams employed nnU-Net or U-Net variants for direct\nregression, while others used custom CNNs (1/7) or more complex architectures in-\ntegrating attention mechanisms or hybrid designs (4/7). Prediction strategies varied\nacross teams: two teams directly regressed biometry values; three teams predicted\n3D landmark coordinates; and two teams generated 3D landmark heatmaps. In the\nlatter two approaches, biometry values were subsequently computed using scripts\nprovided by the organizers. Most teams used 3D models (6/7), implemented primar-\nily in PyTorch (6/7), with one using TensorFlow. Three teams leveraged external\ndata , such as dHCP and fetal brain atlases, or employed foundation models pre-\ntrained on large-scale datasets.\n17\n\nTable 2: Summary of the algorithms submitted for the fetal brain tissue segmentation task.\nTeam nameModel Archi-\ntectureDeep Learn-\ning Frame-\nworkDim Data AugmentationCross-\nValidationExternal Data Ensembling Original Aspects\ncemrgHybrid Cross\nAttention Swin\nTransformer\nand CNNPyTorch,\nnnUNet3DHorizontal Flipping, Vertical flipping,\nscaling, normalization5-fold No NoThe Cross Attention Transformer\n(CAT) block design.\nCeSNE-DiGAIR 3D UNet MONAI 3DDeformable (SyN) registrations be-\ntween couples of neurotypicall and\npathological scans from the pre-\nprocessed training dataset.

Brain tissue segmentation ranking\nSegmentation performance overview. Figure 4 highlights performance across sites\nand metrics, revealing a general performance plateau among top methods. For\nmost teams, average Dice scores stabilized around 0.8-0.82 , HD95 around 2.8-2.1 ,\nand VS around 0.9-0.92 , while the ED showed wider variability (ranging from 20\nto40), highlighting its sensitivity to topological inaccuracies.\nSite-specific trends. Despite being introduced in this edition as a new low-field, out-\nof-domain dataset, KCL showed the best segmentation performance. In contrast,\nKISPI yielded the lowest performance, even though it was part of the previous edi-\ntions\u2019 training and testing data. Across metrics, UCSF and KISPI displayed higher\ninterquartile ranges, particularly for Dice, HD95, and VS, reflecting greater variabil-\nity across methods. Some teams ( falcons ,qdneuroincyte ) experienced perfor-\nmance drops on sites that use NiftyMIC SRR, like UCSF or VIEN, with Dice scores\ndropping to 0.38\u20130.44 compared to 0.76\u20130.83 on other sites.\nLabel-specific trends. SGM, GM, and BS were consistently the most challenging la-\nbels to segment across all teams, as shown by lower performance metrics in Supple-\nmentary Materials A4. Among the top three models, Dice scores dropped from an\n19\n\naverage (across all labels) of 0.82 to 0.80 for SGM, 0.79 for BS, and 0.74 for GM.\nHD95 increased from 2.24 to 3.6 for BS and 3.0 for SGM, while VS declined from\n0.92 to 0.86 for SGM and 0.88 for BS. GM also showed a marked increase in ED,\nfrom 33.14 to 137, reflecting a significant loss in topological accuracy.\n0.00.20.40.60.81.0DiceKISPI\n0.00.20.40.60.81.0VIEN\n0.00.20.40.60.81.0UCSF\n0.00.20.40.60.81.0CHUV\n0.00.20.40.60.81.0KCL\n100101102HD95\n100101102\n100101102\n100101102\n100101102\n0.00.20.40.60.81.0VS\n0.00.20.40.60.81.0\n0.00.20.40.60.81.0\n0.00.20.40.60.81.0\n0.00.20.40.60.81.0\n100101102103Euler diff.\n100101102103\n100101102103\n100101102103\n100101102103\nT eam\ncesne-digair\nmic-dkfz-feta24\nvicorobfeta_sigma\ncemrg_feta\nupfetal24hilab\nlit\nlmrcmcunipd-sum-aug\npasteurdbc\njwcradqd_neuroincyte\nfalcons\nparamahir_2023\nFigure 4: Segmentation performance by site and evaluation metric.

In a compar-\native example, mic-dkfz-feta24 achieves similar Dice and lower HD95 scores but\nwe updated the way the ground-truth Euler characteristic is determined. In the original rankings, it\nwas computed based on the manual segmentations. In the current results, it is calculated from man-\nually defined topological properties (see 2.4). Manual segmentations were created via interpolation\nand because many structures were not segmented on every slice, the resulting ground-truth segmen-\ntations contained numerous topological errors (e.g., holes, disconnected components). As a result,\nthey did not reliably represent the expected topological properties of the anatomical structures. To\naddress this, we now use manually specified topological values to calculate the ground-truth EC.\n21\n\npoorer ED and VS, suggesting that voxel-level agreement alone may not suffice for\ntasks requiring topologically accurate surfaces, such as morphological analysis.\nEuler difference: 60 cesne-digair mic-dkfz-feta24 \nDice: 0.79        HD95: 1.1 \nVS: 0.84 Dice: 0.81     HD95: 0.8 \nVS: 0.86 \nDice: 0.74      HD95: 2.3 \nVS: 0.96 Dice: 0.73      HD95: 1.6 \nVS: 0.81 Euler difference: 78 Euler difference: 902 Euler difference: 7 \nFigure 6: Segmentation results and reconstructed cortical GM surfaces for two representative fetal\ncases from cesne-digair and mic-dkfz-feta24 , visualized using ITK-SNAP (Yushkevich et al.,\n2006). The top row (fetus at 22 weeks GA) illustrates that higher Dice scores sometimes corre-\nspond to smaller topological errors. However, the bottom row (fetus at 30 weeks GA) demonstrates\nsignificant topological issues (e.g., holes, fragmentation) in the mic-dkfz-feta24 surface, despite\ncomparable Dice and HD95 values. This underscores the need for additional topological and struc-\ntural metrics, such as ED, to comprehensively evaluate segmentation quality, as metrics like Dice\nor HD95 alone are insufficient to capture topological accuracy.\nPer-tissue and condition analysis. Extended performance results split by site, tissue\nlabel, and pathology status are available in supplementary materials (sections A3,\nA4, and A5, respectively).\n3.2.2.

In contrast,\nsBIP and bBIP were among the best estimated. Notably, only jwcrad surpassed\nthe baseline across all measurements, while a few others, including feta sigma and\npasteurdbc , did so on selected metrics.\nAlthough multiple teams performed comparably on individual metrics, the clear\nwinner in the ranking (see Table 5) was jwcrad , demonstrating consistent superiority\nacross both site and measurement variations.\nRobustness in pathological vs. neurotypical condition. To assess model generaliz-\nability, we compared biometry performance between neurotypical and pathological\nbrains (see Figure 8). While most measurements did not reveal statistically sig-\nnificant differences between groups, bBIP showed better accuracy in the healthy\ncohort, particularly at VIEN. Conversely, UCSF results suggested slightly better\nperformance for pathological subjects.\nIn summary, the best-performing method, jwcrad , came within 9% of expert\nagreement for some measurements (e.g., TCD). However, for others like bBIP, its\nresults differed from the expert range by as much as 60%. This reveals important\ngaps where automated biometry methods still fall short, especially in pathological\ncases.\n23\n\npasteurdbcfalconsparamahir_2023qd_neuroincytecesne-digair[GA]feta_sigmajwcrad[inter-rater]0.00.51.0MAPEKCL\nfalconspasteurdbcparamahir_2023qd_neuroincyte[GA]feta_sigmacesne-digairjwcrad[inter-rater]KISPI\nfalconsqd_neuroincytepasteurdbcparamahir_2023feta_sigmajwcradcesne-digair[GA][inter-rater]VIEN\nfalconsqd_neuroincyteparamahir_2023pasteurdbcfeta_sigma[GA]cesne-digairjwcrad[inter-rater]UCSF\nqd_neuroincyteparamahir_2023falconspasteurdbccesne-digair[GA]jwcradfeta_sigma[inter-rater]CHUVfalconsqd_neuroincyteparamahir_2023pasteurdbccesne-digair[GA]feta_sigmajwcrad[inter-rater]0.00.51.0MAPELCC\nfalconspasteurdbcqd_neuroincyteparamahir_2023feta_sigma[GA]jwcradcesne-digair[inter-rater]HV\nqd_neuroincytefalconsparamahir_2023[GA]feta_sigmajwcradcesne-digairpasteurdbc[inter-rater]sBIP\nqd_neuroincyteparamahir_2023falcons[GA]pasteurdbcfeta_sigmajwcradcesne-digair[inter-rater]bBIP\nqd_neuroincytefalconsparamahir_2023feta_sigmacesne-digair[GA]jwcradpasteurdbc[inter-rater]TCDFigure 7: Biometry results per site (top) and label (bottom) for all teams participating in the Task\n2 together with the GA baseline model ([GA]) and the inter-rater variability [inter-rater].

Domain shifts evaluation\n3.4.1. Impact of image quality on performance\nThe impact of image quality on model performance as determined by computing\nthe conditional mean across quality ratings ( E[f(x)|Quality]) is shown in the right-\nmost column in Figure 10. We see a clear effect of image quality on Dice, with a\ngenerally increasing Dice with the increasing image quality, amounting to a change\nfrom 0.75 Dice on average for the lowest quality data (with scores close to 1) and\nan average quality close to 0.85 for the highest quality data. Results using HD95\nand VS generally align with the ones from Dice, except for GA and quality. The\nrelationship is, however, not as clear for ED, although best quality images tend to\nyield the smallest ED.\nA more detailed analysis of the correlation between quality and the difference\nscores in the supplementary materials A7 showed a generally high Pearson correlation\nbetween quality and Dice ( r= 0.5-0.7) for all sites except KISPI-mial ( r=0.4) and\nUSCF-nmic ( r=0.06 \u2013 no correlation). The same trends, although weaker, were\nobserved for HD95 and VS, except CHUV-mial and HD95, which had virtually no\ncorrelation ( r=0.05). Results for ED showed no clear pattern, and larger correlations\n(r=0.3-0.4) were not statistically significant.\n3.4.2. Relative contribution of domain-shift sources\nFigure 10 displays the conditional means across different factors. The analysis\nrevealed a pronounced site-SR effect: for example, the KISPI-mial site produced\nnotably lower Dice scores, whereas the CHUV-mial site was associated with higher\nED values.

Blue dots correspond to lower values of a variable (i.e. low GA, low quality), and\nred ones to higher values.\nuniquely incorporated a denoising autoencoder (Larrazabal et al., 2020) to enhance\nsegmentation accuracy. This approach significantly boosted their performance, lead-\ning to a 50% improvement in the ED metric compared to the second-best team.\nThis gain was particularly important for topological correctness, as no other metric\nshowed such a large performance gap. All top-three teams applied extensive data\naugmentation, including techniques like SynthSeg (Billot et al., 2023), combinations\nof standard augmentations, and deformable registration between pathological and\nhealthy subjects to simulate greater anatomical diversity, as well as model ensem-\nbling.\nThe top three biometry teams each approached estimation differently\u2014using key-\npoint regression, landmark heatmap segmentation, and other methods\u2014but all relied\non the results of the tissues segmentation and 3D models. Their model architectures\nvaried (CNN, U-Net, and Transformer), indicating that no standard baseline has\nyet emerged for this task. The diversity in methods suggests that the field is still\nexploring the most effective strategies for biometry estimation.\nTopology metric is a valuable add-on. In the brain tissue segmentation task, the\nintroduction of the topology-aware metric provided meaningful complementary in-\nsights beyond traditional overlap-based measures. Despite the architectural diversity\n29\n\nand growing methodological sophistication of the submitted approaches, the perfor-\nmance differences among the top teams were minimal, with Dice scores showing\ntight clustering, suggesting that gains in segmentation accuracy may be reaching a\nplateau. Differences in team rankings across evaluation metrics (Dice, HD95, VS,\nED) highlight the need to consider complementary metrics beyond voxel-wise over-\nlap. Introducing ED as a ranking metric provided a more nuanced assessment of the\nsegmentation quality. This is reflected in Table 6, where we see a marked improve-\nment in ED. While teams did not specifically optimize their models for topological\nconsistency, the new ranking scheme allowed us to discriminate between methods\nthat otherwise had very similar performances (Table 4). Evaluation noise, where\nperformance variations across testing sets is larger than the difference across top-\nperforming methods, is a well-known problem in medical imaging challenges (Varo-\nquaux and Cheplygina, 2022), and the introduction of an additional ranking metric\nallowed for selection methods with desirable properties. Further validation on clin-\nical tasks leveraging surface extraction(Clouchoux et al., 2011; Yehuda et al., 2023)\nwould be needed to truly see the potential of encouraging topological consistency in\nthe FeTA challenge.\nLow-field MRI tissue segmentation quality is encouraging. The newly introduced\n0.55T data from KCL provided an unexpected insight: it consistently achieved the\nhighest segmentation accuracy across all sites. However, it is important to note that,\nto reduce domain shifts, we retrospectively selected high-quality reconstructions us-\ning a version of SVRTK specifically tailored for low-field MRI data(Uus et al., 2020,\n2024). This careful case selection, paired with a very recent SR pipeline, might have\npositively biased the performance for this cohort. As such, performance on more\nchallenging low-field cases remains to be fully assessed. Nevertheless, these results\nare encouraging for two reasons: progress in SR pipelines (Uus et al., 2024; Xu et al.,\n2023) means that more challenging cases will be successfully reconstructed, and that\nimage quality will generally increase (Sanchez et al., 2024a; Uus et al., 2023b). Low-\nfield MRI systems hold significant promise for expanding access to prenatal imaging,\nparticularly in low- and middle-income countries. When combined with good image\nquality and advances in automatic fetal exam planning (Neves Silva et al., 2024),\nthey could meaningfully enhance prenatal care in resource-limited settings.\nAutomated biometry needs strong baselines to ensure meaningful progress. To reflect\ncurrent clinical practice and bridge the gap between routine 2D fetal brain assess-\nments and emerging 3D imaging techniques, we introduced a new biometry task\nfocused on 2D brain measurements\u2014key clinical indicators traditionally used to as-\nsess fetal neurodevelopmental status (Tilea et al., 2009; Lamon et al., 2024). One of\n30\n\nthe striking results of this first edition is that most submissions did not manage to\noutperform a simple model, that predicts biometry solely based on gestational age,\ncompletely ignoring image information. Most teams built biometry estimators atop\nsegmentation outputs, potentially propagating segmentation errors, particularly in\nsmaller and more complex structures such as vermis and corpus callosum measure-\nments. Importantly, the biometric measurements used in this challenge were derived\nfrom clinical 2D protocols. While these can be estimated from 3D volumes, they\nwere originally designed for manual 2D evaluation. This suggests that alternative\nmeasurements, specifically tailored to leverage the full spatial context of 3D SRR\nimages, may offer even more informative and robust indicators of fetal neurodevel-\nopment, though such approaches remain largely unexplored. Nevertheless, this first\ncompetition confirms, once more, the need to have strong baseline models and vali-\ndation procedures (Eisenmann et al., 2023), and that deep learning might not always\nbe the optimal solution (Grinsztajn et al., 2022).\n4.2. FeTA challenge in perspective\nFeTA across the years. A retrospective analysis of FeTA challenge results over the\nyears revealed no statistically significant improvements in performance metrics, with\nthe exception of ED at two out of five sites. Similarly, no notable improvement\nwas seen at the label level, with GM, SGM, and BS consistently remaining the\nmost challenging structures to segment. GM is particularly difficult due to its very\nthin appearance in fetal brains, where partial volume effects and complex surface\nmorphology make it especially prone to topological segmentation errors, leading to\nsignificantly higher ED values compared to other labels. Moreover, both GM and\nSGM have inherently low tissue contrast in MRI, making them harder to distinguish\naccurately (Prayer et al., 2006). These challenges are further illustrated in Sup-\nplementary Materials A9.1, which provide qualitative examples showing that most\nsegmentation errors occur in regions corresponding to GM, SGM, and BS. This out-\ncome is not entirely unexpected, as most top-performing teams relied on similar 3D\narchitectures\u2014primarily 3D U-Net (C \u00b8i\u00b8 cek et al., 2016) and nnU-Net (Isensee et al.,\n2018)\u2014enhanced with extensive data augmentation and model ensembling. These\nfindings suggest that incremental architectural modifications or model engineering\nalone are unlikely to yield substantial gains, aligning with trends observed in other\nchallenges where U-Net-based approaches often outperform more complex alterna-\ntives (Eisenmann et al., 2023). While these techniques help mitigate certain domain\nshifts related to scanner differences or pathological variations, some cases remain\npersistently difficult across all methods. Addressing these harder cases may require\ndeeper domain expertise and a shift toward a more data-centric approach, prioritiz-\n31\n\ning data quality, annotation consistency, and dataset diversity as core components\nof model development (Sambasivan et al., 2021; Zha et al., 2023).\nSources of domain shifts. Domain shifts are widely recognized as a key challenge for\ndeep learning methods in medical imaging (Dock` es et al., 2021; Wiles et al., 2021;\nRichiardi et al., 2025), yet the specific sources of these shifts are rarely disentangled.\nIn our analysis, though not causal, we observed that image quality had the strongest\nimpact on generalization performance: moving from the lowest to the highest quality\nlevels resulted in an average Dice score difference of approximately 0.10. In contrast,\ngestational age had a more modest effect, influencing Dice scores by about 0.05,\nwhile the scanning site contributed a difference of around 0.075 between the best-\nand worst-performing centers. Interestingly, pathology was the least influential fac-\ntor, accounting for only about 0.008 in Dice variation. Additionally, because Dice\nis known to be biased toward larger structures (Maier-Hein et al., 2024), we also\nevaluated performance using a normalized Dice metric that accounts for label vol-\nume (Raina et al., 2023). As detailed in the supplementary materials section A8, the\nnormalized Dice scores yielded rankings nearly identical to those based on standard\nDice, indicating that structure size did not significantly distort the comparative per-\nformance of the reviewed algorithms, suggesting that while the size bias exists, its\neffect was uniform across methods.\nOur results show that, despite pathological cases making up only about one-third\nof the training data, models were still able to generalize to pathological examples\nin the test set. While performance was slightly lower for pathological subjects in\nsome datasets compared to healthy subjects, submitted models demonstrated the\nability to correctly handle both healthy and pathological data. Given the rarity and\nwide variability of fetal pathologies (Attallah et al., 2019), expanding pathological\ndatasets\u2014whether through additional real cases or synthetic data (Dannecker et al.,\n2024; Kaandorp et al., 2025b)\u2014will be crucial to narrowing this performance gap and\nimproving overall model robustness, which is an important step toward real-world\nclinical deployment.\nOverall, our findings suggest that technical and acquisition-related factors may\nplay a more significant role in out-of-domain generalization than subject-level clinical\nvariables. Still, further causal investigations (Castro et al., 2020) are needed to\nconfirm these patterns and to avoid misinterpretation due to confounding factors.\n4.3. Roadmap for future advancements in fetal brain MRI analysis\nWhile many proposed solutions appear to be reaching a performance plateau,\nmodel-centric innovations still play an important role. That said, incorporating\ndomain-specific augmentations and auxiliary learning objectives may lead to more\n32\n\nimpactful improvements than simply refining model architectures. For example, en-\nforcing topological consistency within the loss function, as demonstrated by de Du-\nmast et al. (2022); Li et al. (2023); Lux et al. (2024)\u2014can help maintain anatomical\nplausibility in the predictions. Similarly, integrating uncertainty estimation pro-\nvides a powerful way of identifying low-confidence predictions, which is particularly\nrelevant in clinical decision-support systems. Several studies (Zenk et al., 2025;\nMolchanova et al., 2025) have demonstrated the utility of uncertainty-aware models\nfor quality control in medical image segmentation.\nBeyond model architecture, data-driven strategies hold substantial potential for\nimprovement. A notable limitation of current solutions is the relatively modest use\nofexternal data , which has been largely limited to healthy subjects from datasets like\ndHCP or fetal brain atlases (Gholipour et al., 2017; Uus et al., 2023a; Price et al.,\n2019). Leveraging broader, more diverse datasets \u2014 especially those capturing rare\nor pathological conditions \u2014 could support more robust and clinically useful models,\nthough curating and annotating pathological datasets is a huge endeavor.\nManually segmenting the fetal brain is a time-consuming and tedious task, suscep-\ntible to inter-rater variability (Payette et al., 2021), and the FeTA challenge data are\nnot exempt from this issue. When comparing model performance to inter-rater vari-\nability, we observe that top-performing teams\u2014achieving Dice scores around 0.82,\nHD95 around 2.2, and VS around 0.92\u2014are approaching the best observed human\nagreement levels, previously estimated on a subset of data as 0 .73\u00b10.15 for Dice,\n3.45\u00b12.34 for HD95, and 0 .86\u00b10.10 for VS (Payette et al., 2023). This raises the\nintriguing possibility that some predictions may be more faithful to the underlying\nanatomy than the ground truth annotations, potentially leading to penalization of\nhigh-performing models (Valabregue et al., 2024a,b).\nA promising direction to address the limitations of data diversity and annotation\navailability is data synthesis (Zalevskyi et al., 2024), particularly for generating rare\nor pathological fetal brain appearances. Recent work (Dannecker et al., 2024; Liu\net al., 2024; Kaandorp et al., 2025a) has highlighted the potential of synthetic data\nto augment training and improve sensitivity to abnormal anatomy. Moreover, the\nstrong influence of image quality on generalization performance underscores the need\nfor better modeling of artifacts specific to fetal brain SR pipelines (Sanchez et al.,\n2024a). These efforts, in combination with foundation models and domain adapta-\ntion techniques, offer exciting prospects for enhancing model generalization across\nscanners, domains, and populations, ultimately helping to mitigate model drift and\nsupport the development of more trustworthy AI systems.\n33\n\n5. Conclusion\nThe FeTA 2024 challenge provided a valuable opportunity to evaluate the progress\nmade in fetal brain segmentation since previous editions and to expand the scope\ntoward new, clinically relevant tasks such as biometry. Our additional validation\nusing the Euler difference metric showed that some existing methods can already\nproduce topologically consistent segmentations. However, achieving this consistency\nmore reliably, particularly through improved segmentation losses, remains an open\narea for further development. Likewise, the successful application of models to low-\nfield data, with surprisingly strong performance, highlights both the advancements in\nrecent super-resolution methods and the models\u2019 capacity to generalize across diverse\nimaging settings.\nIn the biometry task, this first edition offered key insights, particularly on the\nimportance of providing simple baseline models to guide participants. It also led to\nthe emergence of a promising approach for automated biometry prediction.\nAs the field of fetal brain MRI analysis continues to evolve, FeTA 2024 emphasizes\nthe need not only for more powerful and innovative models but also for building\nreliable and generalizable tools that can support real-world clinical adoption.\nDeclaration of competing interests\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or\npersonal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in\nthis paper.\nData availability\nPart of the challenge data is available on Synapse, as described in the paper.\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (182602,\n215641, IZKSZ3 218590), ERA-NET Neuron MULTI-FACT project (SNSF 31NE30\n203977), UKRI FLF (MR/T018119/1), the Adaptive Brain Circuits in Development\nand Learning Project, University Research Priority Program of the University of\nZ\u00a8 urich; by the Vontobel Foundation; by the Anna M\u00a8 uller Grocholski Foundation\nand the Prof. Max Cloetta Foundation and DFG Heisenberg funding (502024488);\nwe acknowledge the Leenaards and Jeantet Foundations as well as CIBM Center for\n34\n\nBiomedical Imaging, a Swiss research center of excellence founded and supported by\nCHUV, UNIL, EPFL, UNIGE and HUG.\nDiego Fajardo-Rojas would like to acknowledge funding from the EPSRC Centre\nfor Doctoral Training in Smart Medical Imaging (EP/S022104/1).\nLyuyang Tong, Bo Du and Jingwen Jiang would like to acknowledge funding\nfrom the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grants\n2023YFC2705700, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grants\n62306217 and 62225113, the Postdoctoral Fellowship Program of CPSF under Grant\nNumber GZC20231987, the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under Grant\nNumber 2024T170686 and 2024M752471, the Major Program (JD) of Hubei Province\n(2023BAA017), the Innovative Research Group Project of Hubei Province under\nGrants 2024AFA017.\nGerard Mart\u00b4 \u0131-Juan is supported by the project PCI2021-122044-2A, funded by\nthe project ERA-NET NEURON Cofund2, by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033/\nand by the European Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR.\nR.

Higher values\nof DSC indicate better overlap.\n2.Volume Similarity (VS) : Assesses similarity of volumes between predicted and GT segmentations,\ndefined as:\nV S= 1\u2212|Vpred\u2212VGT|\n|Vpred+VGT|\nwhere VpredandVGTare the volumes of the predicted and GT regions, respectively. A value close to\n1 indicates high similarity.\n3.Hausdorff Distance (HD95) : Quantifies contour similarity between predicted and GT segmenta-\ntions using the 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance:\nHD95 = max/parenleftbigg\nmax\nx\u2208Amin\ny\u2208B\u2225x\u2212y\u2225,max\ny\u2208Bmin\nx\u2208A\u2225x\u2212y\u2225/parenrightbigg\nwhere AandBare boundary points of the predicted and GT segmentations, and \u2225 \u00b7 \u2225 denotes the\nEuclidean distance. Lower HD95 values indicate better contour agreement.\n4.Euler Characteristics (ED) Difference : Evaluates topological similarity between predicted and\nGT segmentations, based on Betti numbers. The Euler characteristic is:\nEC= Betti 0\u2212Betti 1+ Betti 2\nwhere Betti 0is the number of connected components, Betti 1the number of loops, and Betti 2the\nnumber of voids. The EC difference is computed as:\nED=|ECpred\u2212ECGT|\nSmaller differences indicate better topological alignment. The expected GT values for Betti numbers\nare: BN 1= 0 and BN 2= 0 for all brain tissues. For the eCSF, WM, ventricles, cerebellum, dGM, and\nbrainstem, BN 0= 1; for GM, BN 0= 2.\nThese metrics together provide a comprehensive evaluation of segmentation accuracy, considering spatial\noverlap, volume, shape, and topology.\nTask 2: Biometry Estimation\nThe primary metric for evaluating biometry estimation algorithms is mean average percentage error\n(MAPE) , quantifying error relative to actual measurements:\nMAPE =1\nNN/summationdisplay\ni=1|yi\u2212\u02c6yi|\nyi\u00d7100\nwhere yiand \u02c6yiare the ground truth and predicted measurements, respectively, and Nis the total number\nof measurements.\nThis metric accounts for variable target structure sizes and assesses the accuracy of the estimated biometric\nmeasurements.\n\nAppendix A2.

To complement\nthe primary evaluation metrics, we also report the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) , which offers an intuitive\ninterpretation of the prediction errors in physical units (millimeters).\nThe MAE is defined as:\nMAE =1\nNN/summationdisplay\ni=1|\u02c6yi\u2212yi|\nwhere Nis the number of samples, \u02c6 yiis the predicted measurement for the i-th subject, and yiis the\ncorresponding ground truth measurement.\nAll MAE values are reported in millimeters (mm), which facilitates a direct understanding of the magnitude\nof the errors made by the algorithms in the context of fetal brain structure dimensions.\nTable A6.1.

Exploring normalized Dice coefficient\nCorrelation between Dice, Normalized Dice, Volume, and GA In Figure A8.1 (a), we present\nthe distribution of Pearson correlation coefficients between each team\u2019s Dice score and the volume of the\nsegmented label, averaged across all subjects for the 15 participating teams in the FeTA 2024 challenge.\nWe observe that using the normalized Dice coefficient mitigates the known bias of the standard Dice metric\ntoward larger volumes. However, normalized Dice does not eliminate the correlation with gestational age\n(GA). This residual association may be due to GA acting as a complex confounding factor, potentially\ninteracting with other variables such as acquisition site and pathology, rather than directly influencing the\nmetric.\nImpact of Using Normalized Dice on Team Rankings In Figure A8.1 (b), we assess the stability of\nteam rankings when using normalized Dice instead of the standard Dice score. Although normalized Dice\nreduces the volume-related bias, the correlation structure across teams appears relatively stable. Rankings\nremain largely consistent, with only two pairs of teams swapping positions. Notably, the top six teams\nmaintain their original ranking when switching from Dice to normalized Dice, suggesting that the relative\nperformance differences are robust to this normalization.\nVolume GA\nT arget0.2\n0.1\n0.00.10.20.30.40.5Correlation\nDice type\nDice\nnormalized Dice\n(a) Correlation coefficients between Dice/normalized\nDice with volume and GA.\nmic-dkfz-feta24vicorob\nfeta_sigma cemrg_fetaupfetal24pasteurdbchilab\ncesne-digair\nunipd-sum-auglit\nlmrcmc jwcrad\nqd_neuroincytefalcons\nparamahir_2023\nT eam02468101214Rank (Lower is Better)T eam Rankings: Dice vs. nDSC\nDice Ranking\nnDSC Ranking(b) Team-ranking stability using Dice vs. normalized\nDice.\nFigure A8.1: (a) Per-team Dice vs. volume/GA correlations.

MANTOVANI, AND P. SCHLOSSER\nAbstract. In 2016, the spectral theory on the S-spectrum was used to establish the H\u221e-\nfunctional calculus for quaternionic or Cli\ufb00ord operators . This calculus applies for example\nto sectorial or bisectorial right linear operators Tand left slice hyperholomorphic functions\nfthat can grow as polynomials. It relies on the product of the t wo operators e(T)\u22121and\n(ef)(T), both de\ufb01ned via some underlying S-functional calculus (also called \u03c9-functional cal-\nculus). For left slice holomorphic functions fthis de\ufb01nition does not depend on the choice\nof the regularizer function e. However, due to the non-commutative multiplication of Cli f-\nford numbers, it was unclear how to extend this de\ufb01nition to r ight slice hyperholomorphic\nfunctions. This paper addresses this signi\ufb01cant unresolve d issue and shows how right lin-\near operators can possess the H\u221e-functional calculus also for right slice hyperholomorphi c\nfunctions.\nAMS Classi\ufb01cation: 47A10, 47A60.\nKeywords: S-spectrum, S-resolvent operator, H\u221e-functional calculus, Slice hyperholomor-\nphic functions.\nAcknowledgements: Fabrizio Colombo is supported by MUR grant Dipartimento di E c-\ncellenza 2023-2027.

For a comprehensive\nexploration of this calculus, we recommend the books [37, 38 , 39] along with their associated\nreferences.\nThe spectral theory on the S-spectrum has fundamental di\ufb00erences compared to classical\ncomplex spectral theory, because it is derived from the clas sical resolvent series expansion,\nwithout assuming that the operator and the spectral paramet er commute. Speci\ufb01cally, for\nbounded operators T:V\u2192Vacting in a Cli\ufb00ord module V, the series expansion of the\nS-resolvent becomes\n\u221e/summationdisplay\nn=0Tns\u2212n\u22121= (T2\u22122s0T+|s|2)\u22121(s\u2212T),|s|>/ba\u2207dblT/ba\u2207dbl, (1.1)\nwheres=s0+s1e1+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+snenis a paravector, |s|is its modulus and sthe conjugate of\ns. The reason why the value of the series (1.1) does not simplif y to the classical resolvent\noperator ( s\u2212T)\u22121is due to the noncommutativity sT/\\e}atio\\slash=Ts. The explicit value of the sum\n1\n\n2 FABRIZIO COLOMBO, FRANCESCO MANTOVANI, AND P. SCHLOSSER\nin equation (1.1) motivates that, even for unbounded, close d operators T, the spectrum must\nbe associated with the invertibility of the operator\nQs[T] :=T2\u22122s0T+|s|2,with dom( Qs[T]) = dom( T2).\nThis leads us to the de\ufb01nitions of the S-resolvent set and theS-spectrum\n\u03c1S(T) :=/braceleftbig\ns\u2208Rn+1/vextendsingle/vextendsingleQs[T]\u22121\u2208 B(V)/bracerightbig\nand\u03c3S(T) :=Rn+1\\\u03c1S(T),\nwhereB(V) is the space of all bounded operators from Vinto itself (see [20, 26] for more\ndetails). Motivated by (1.1), we de\ufb01ne for every s\u2208\u03c1S(T) theleftand therightS-resolvent\noperator\nS\u22121\nL(s,T) :=Qs[T]\u22121s\u2212TQs[T]\u22121andS\u22121\nR(s,T) := (s\u2212T)Qs[T]\u22121.(1.2)\nwhich is then be used in the de\ufb01nition of the S-functional calculus\nf(T) :=1\n2\u03c0/integraldisplay\n\u2202U\u2229CJS\u22121\nL(s,T)dsJf(s) and f(T) :=1\n2\u03c0/integraldisplay\n\u2202U\u2229CJf(s)dsJS\u22121\nR(s,T),(1.3)\nfor left resp. right slice holomorphic functions f. This is the Cli\ufb00ord analogue of the Riesz-\nDunford functional calculus. Moreover, we remark that the s pectral theorem has recently\nbeen extended from quaternionic operators in [2] to fully Cl i\ufb00ord operators in [22].\nTheH\u221e-functional calculus, as an extension of the S-functional calculus (1.3), has been \ufb01rst\nexplored in works such as [3, 16], while the recent paper [42] introduced the H\u221e-functional\ncalculus for unbounded bisectorial operators within a Cli\ufb00o rd module over the algebra Rn.\nThis work leverages the universality property of the S-functional calculus, as explained in\n[21], which demonstrates its applicability to fully Cli\ufb00ord operators. The idea of the H\u221e-\nfunctional calculus for left slice holomorphic functions f, is to \ufb01nd a regularizer function e,\nsuch that we can de\ufb01ne\nf(T) :=e(T)\u22121(ef)(T),\nwhere both e(T) and (ef)(T) are interpreted in the sense of the S-functional calculus (1.3).\nThanks to [18, Theorem 7.2.6], this de\ufb01nition is independen t of the regularizer e. Since right\nslice hyperholomorphic functions fmaintain slice hyperholomorphicity under multiplication\nwith intrinsic functions efrom the right, a natural attempt of de\ufb01ning f(T) would be as\n(fe)(T)e(T)\u22121. However, it was already noted in [18, Remark 7.2.2], that th is de\ufb01nition is\nnot independent of the regularizer function e. For left linear operators, the situation is of\ncourse the opposite.\nIn Section 4, we provide a solution to this longstanding open problem, by de\ufb01ning the H\u221e-\nfunctional calculus for right linear, bisectorial, inject ive operators Tand right slice holomor-\nphic functions fwith at most polynomial growth, as the closure\nf(T) :=(fe)(T)e(T)\u22121. (1.4)\nSinceweaprioridonotknow that ( fe)(T)e(T)\u22121is closable, theclosurein(1.4)is understood\nin the sense of multivalued operators, see De\ufb01nition 2.2. Th e independence of (1.4) from the\nregularizer eis proven in Theorem 4.8 and crucially depends on the fact tha t for bisectorial\noperators the Banach module Vdecomposes into V= ker(T) +ran(T), see Theorem 3.3.\nThe fact that the right H\u221e-functional calculus (1.4) coincides with the already exis ting left\nH\u221e-functional calculus for intrinsic functions, and with the right\u03c9-functional calculus for\ndecaying functions, is proven in Theorem 4.5 and Theorem 4.6 .\n\n3\nQuaternionic and Cli\ufb00ord operators play an important role ac ross various \ufb01elds of mathe-\nmatics and physics. For example, they are appear in quaterni onic quantum mechanics (see S.\nAdler\u2019sseminal work[1]), invector analysis, di\ufb00erential g eometry, andhypercomplexanalysis.\nVector analysis. The gradient operator with nonconstant coe\ufb03cients in ndimensions repre-\nsents various physical laws, such as Fourier\u2019s law for heat p ropagation and Fick\u2019s law for mass\ntransfer di\ufb00usion. This can be expressed as\nT=n/summationdisplay\ni=1eiai(x)\u2202xi, x\u2208\u2126,\nand is associated with various boundary conditions, as disc ussed in [23]. Here, e1,...,en\nrepresent the imaginary units of the Cli\ufb00ord algebra Rn, and the coe\ufb03cients a1,...,a nare\nassumed to belong to C1(\u2126) and satisfy appropriate bounds.\nDi\ufb00erential geometry. Let (M,g) be a Riemannian manifold of dimension n, andUa coordi-\nnate neighbourhoodof M. In this neighbourhood, we can \ufb01ndan orthonormal frame of ve ctor\n\ufb01eldsE1,...,E n, such that the Dirac operator on ( U,g) can be expressed as the C\u221e(U,H)\ndi\ufb00erential operator\nD=n/summationdisplay\ni=1ei\u2207\u03c4\nEi, (1.5)\nwhere\u2207\u03c4\nEidenotes the covariant derivative with respect to the vector \ufb01eldEi. For more\ndetails see the book [35]. As a special case, [11] considers t he Dirac operator in hyperbolic\nand spherical spaces, where (1.5) takes the explicit forms\nDH=xnn/summationdisplay\ni=1ei\u2202xi\u2212n\u22121\n2enandDS= (1+|x|2)n/summationdisplay\ni=1ei\u2202xi\u2212nx,\nfor (x1,...,xn\u22121,xn)\u2208Rn\u22121\u00d7R+and (x1,...,xn)\u2208Rn, respectively.\nHypercomplex analysis.

Slice hype rholomorphic functions can also\nbe viewed as functions in the kernel of the global operator\nG=|Im(x)|2\u2202x0+Im(x)n/summationdisplay\ni=1xi\u2202xi,\nintroduced in [19], where Im( x) =x1e1+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+xnen.

SCHLOSSER\n2.Preliminaries on Clifford Algebras and Clifford modules\nCli\ufb00ord algebras are associative algebras that generalize c omplex numbers and quaternions.\nThey provide a mathematical framework to study operator the ory in a noncommutative con-\ntext.

For example, the classical theory relat ed to the Dirac operator leads to\nmonogenic function, which admit expansions in terms of Fuet er polynomials. In this article\nwe consider slice hyperholomorphic functions, which allow power series expansions, and are\nparticularly suitable for use with Cli\ufb00ord operators.\n\n5\nDe\ufb01nition 2.1 (Slice hyperholomorphic functions) .LetU\u2286Rn+1be open, axially symmet-\nric and consider\nU:=/braceleftbig\n(x,y)\u2208R2/vextendsingle/vextendsinglex+Sy\u2286U/bracerightbig\n.\nA function f:U\u2192Rnis called left(resp.right)slice hyperholomorphic , if there exist\ncontinuously di\ufb00erentiable functions f0,f1:U \u2192Rn, such that for every ( x,y)\u2208 U:\ni) The function fadmits for every J\u2208Sthe representation\nf(x+Jy) =f0(x,y)+Jf1(x,y),/parenleftBig\nresp.f(x+Jy) =f0(x,y)+f1(x,y)J/parenrightBig\n.\nii) The functions f0,f1satisfy the compatibility conditions\nf0(x,\u2212y) =f0(x,y) and f1(x,\u2212y) =\u2212f1(x,y).\niii) The functions f0,f1satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations\n\u2202\n\u2202xf0(x,y) =\u2202\n\u2202yf1(x,y) and\u2202\n\u2202yf0(x,y) =\u2212\u2202\n\u2202xf1(x,y).\nThe class of left (resp. right) slice hyperholomorphic func tions on Uis denoted by SHL(U)\n(resp.SHR(U)). In the special case that f0andf1are real valued, we call fintrinsic and\nthe space of intrinsic functions is denoted by N(U).\nNext, we turn our attention to Cli\ufb00ord modules over Rn.

For our particular space Vin (2.2) this means that VisR-re\ufb02exive, if and only if VR\nis re\ufb02exive.\nNext, let us denote the set of bounded right linear operators\nB(V) :=/braceleftbig\nT:V\u2192Vright linear/vextendsingle/vextendsingledom(T) =V, Tis bounded/bracerightbig\n,\nas well as the space of closed right linear operators\nK(V) :=/braceleftbig\nT:V\u2192Vright linear/vextendsingle/vextendsingledom(T)\u2286Vis right linear , Tis closed/bracerightbig\n.\n\n6 FABRIZIO COLOMBO, FRANCESCO MANTOVANI, AND P. SCHLOSSER\nIf an unbounded operator Tis not closed, one may ask the question if there exists a close d\nextension. If this is the case we call the operator closable, and the smallest closed extension\nTitsclosure.\nIn thecase an operator is not closable, which happensto beth e case for theright H\u221e-calculus\nin (1.4), the closure in some sense exceeds the notion of oper ators. We will now introduce the\nconcept of multivalued right linear operators (also known as right linear relations) to overcome\nthis problem. The idea is based on the fact that the graph\ngraph(T) =/braceleftbig\n(v,Tv)/vextendsingle/vextendsinglev\u2208dom(T)/bracerightbig\n,\nof a right linear operator T, is a right linear subspace of V\u00d7V.\nDe\ufb01nition 2.2 (Multivalued operators) .Any right linear subspace T \u2286V\u00d7Vis called a\nright linear multivalued operator .\nLet now T,S \u2286V\u00d7Vbe two right linear multivalued operators, and s\u2208Rn. Then the sum\nand product of multivalued operators is de\ufb01ned as\nT+S:=/braceleftbig\n(v,w1+w2)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle(v,w1)\u2208 T,(v,w2)\u2208 S/bracerightbig\n,\nsT:=/braceleftbig\n(v,sw)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle(v,w)\u2208 T/bracerightbig\n, (2.3)\nT \u25e6S:=/braceleftbig\n(v,u)\u2208V\u00d7V/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\u2203w\u2208Vsuch that ( v,w)\u2208 Sand (w,u)\u2208 T/bracerightbig\n.\nWe can also equip any multivalued operator naturally with a d omain\ndom(T) :=/braceleftbig\nv\u2208V| \u2203w\u2208Vsuch that( v,w)\u2208 T/bracerightbig\n. (2.4)\nThe great advantage of treating multivalued operators in ou r case is, that every right linear\nmultivalued operator Tadmits a closure\nT:=/braceleftbig\n(v,w)\u2208V\u00d7V/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\u2203(vn,wn)n\u2208 Tsuch that ( v,w) = lim\nn\u2192\u221e(vn,wn)/bracerightbig\n,(2.5)\nwhich is again a right linear multivalued operator. Note, th at in the case that TandSare\ngraphs of right linear operator TandS, the de\ufb01nitions (2.3) coincide with the classical sum\nand product of operators. Also the closure (2.5) of multival ued operators coincides with the\nclassical closure of operators in the case that Tis closable. A more detailed introduction into\nmultivalued operators can for example be found in [9, Sectio n 1].\n3.Properties of bisectorial operators\nWe collect in this section important properties of bisector ial Cli\ufb00ord operators. We state and\nprove some consequences of the bisectoriality estimate of t he leftS-resolvent in Lemma 3.2.\nFor re\ufb02exive Banach modules we show in Theorem 3.3 that bisec torial operators are always\ndensely de\ufb01ned. Finally, in Theorem 3.5 we study also powers of a bisectorial operator.\nIn order to introduce bisectorial operators we de\ufb01ne for eve ry\u03c9\u2208(0,\u03c0\n2) thedouble sector\n\u03c9D\u03c9D\u03c9:=/braceleftbig\nreJ\u03c6/vextendsingle/vextendsingler >0, J\u2208S, \u03c6\u2208I\u03c9/bracerightbig\n,(3.1)\nusing the union of intervals\nI\u03c9:= (\u2212\u03c9,\u03c9)\u222a(\u03c0\u2212\u03c9,\u03c0+\u03c9).\n\n7\nDe\ufb01nition 3.1 (Bisectorial operators) .An operator T\u2208 K(V) is called bisectorial of angle\n\u03c9\u2208(0,\u03c0\n2), if itsS-spectrum is contained in the closed double sector\n\u03c3S(T)\u2286D\u03c9,\nand for every \u03d5\u2208(\u03c9,\u03c0\n2) there exists C\u03d5\u22650, such that the left S-resolvent (1.2) satis\ufb01es\n/ba\u2207dblS\u22121\nL(s,T)/ba\u2207dbl \u2264C\u03d5\n|s|, s\u2208Rn+1\\(D\u03d5\u222a{0}).

(4.6)\nBy [42, Theorem 3.16], the \u03c9-functional calculus of the regularizer function e(s) =sm\n(1+s2)m\ncan be written as\ne(T) =Tm(1+T2)\u2212m.\nConsequently, its range is given by\nran(e(T)) = dom( Tm)\u2229ran(Tm).\nHowever, we also know the range of rn[T]mfrom (3.18), which then clearly gives us\nvn=rn[T]mv\u2208ran(rn[T]m)\u2286ran(e(T)) = dom/parenleftbig\n(fe)(T)e(T)\u22121/parenrightbig\n. (4.7)\nUsing once more the operator inclusion (4.5) as well as the co mmutation\nf(T)rn[T]m\u2287rn[T]mf(T),\nfrom [42, Corollary 5.11 i)], we can rewrite\n(fe)(T)e(T)\u22121vn=f(T)vn=f(T)rn[T]mv=rn[T]mf(T)v.\nThe convergence (3.17) used for the vector u=f(T)v, then gives the limit\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e(fe)(T)e(T)\u22121vn= lim\nn\u2192\u221ern[T]mf(T)v=f(T)v.

Then for every f\u2208 SH0\nR(D\u03b8),\n\u03b8\u2208(\u03c9,\u03c0\n2), the operator ( fe)(T)e(T)\u22121is closable, and the right \u03c9-functional calculus (4.2)\ncan be written as\nf(T) =(fe)(T)e(T)\u22121. (4.9)\nHeree(s) =sm\n(1+s2)m, for some arbitrary m\u2208N.\nProof.For the inclusion \u201c \u2286\u201c we note that due to the product rule ( fe)(T) =f(T)e(T) of\nthe\u03c9-functional calculus, there is\n(fe)(T)e(T)\u22121=f(T)e(T)e(T)\u22121\u2286f(T). (4.10)\nSincef(T) is bounded and hence closed, there is ( fe)(T)e(T)\u22121closable, and\n(fe)(T)e(T)\u22121\u2286f(T).\nFor the inclusion \u201c \u2287\u201c letv\u2208V. With the operators rn[T] from (3.17) we then de\ufb01ne the\napproximating sequence\nvn:=rn[T]mv.\nWe then know from (4.7) and (3.17), that\nvn\u2208dom((fe)(T)e(T)\u22121) and lim\nn\u2192\u221evn=v. (4.11)\nUsing once more the already derived operator inclusion (4.1 0), as well as the fact that f(T)\nis a bounded operator, there then also converges\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e(fe)(T)e(T)\u22121vn= lim\nn\u2192\u221ef(T)vn=f(T)v. (4.12)\nThe two limits (4.11) and (4.12) now show that v\u2208dom/parenleftbig\n(fe)(T)e(T)\u22121/parenrightbig\n, which proves also\nthe second inclusion. /square\nThe representations (4.4) and (4.9) will now serve as a motiv ation for the H\u221e-functional\ncalculus of right slice hyperholomorphic functions. Note t hat in (4.4) and (4.9) the respective\nright hand sides look formally the same as in the upcoming de\ufb01 nition (4.13). However, for\nthose special functions fit turned out that that the operator ( fe)(T)e(T)\u22121was closable and\nthe closure was understood in the sense of operators. Since f or general fthis is no longer the\ncase, we have to interpret the closure in (4.13) in the sense o f multivalued operators, which\nconsequently means that the right H\u221e-functional calculus f(T) is not an operator but rather\na multivalued operator in the sense of De\ufb01nition 2.2.\nDe\ufb01nition 4.7 (RightH\u221e-functional calculus) .LetVbe aR-re\ufb02exive Banach module and\nT\u2208 K(V) injective, bisectorial of angle \u03c9\u2208(0,\u03c0\n2).

The right H\u221e-functional calculus in De\ufb01nition 4.7 is well de\ufb01ned. In par tic-\nular this means that\ni)f(T) is independent of the chosen integer m > \u03b1;\n\n15\nii)f(T) coincides with the left H\u221e-functional calculus (4.3) for f\u2208 Npoly(D\u03b8);\niii)f(T) coincides with the right \u03c9-functional calculus (4.2) for f\u2208 SH0\nR(D\u03b8).\nProof.ii),iii) Thefactthat f(T) coincides for f\u2208 Npoly(D\u03b8) withtheleft H\u221e-functional cal-\nculus, and for f\u2208 SH0\nR(D\u03b8) with the right \u03c9-functional calculus, was proven in Theorem 4.5\nand Theorem 4.6.\ni) In order to prove that (4.13) is independent of the choice o fm, let us consider the function\ne(s) =s\n1+s2and integers m1,m2\u2208N, withm1\u2265m2> \u03b1. We will prove that\n(fem1)(T)e(T)\u2212m1=(fem2)(T)e(T)\u2212m2. (4.14)\nThe inclusion \u201c \u2286\u201c follows immediately from the product rule of the \u03c9-functional calculus\n[42, Theorem 3.11], namely\n(fem1)(T)e(T)\u2212m1= (fem2em1\u2212m2)(T)e(T)\u2212(m1\u2212m2)e(T)\u2212m2\n= (fem2)(T)e(T)m1\u2212m2e(T)\u2212(m1\u2212m2)e(T)\u2212m2\n\u2286(fem2)(T)e(T)\u2212m2. (4.15)\nTaking the closures of both sides gives the \ufb01rst inclusion in (4.14).\nFor the inverse inclusion \u201c \u2287\u201c in (4.14) let v\u2208dom/parenleftbig\n(fem2)(T)e(T)\u2212m2/parenrightbig\n, i.e.\nv\u2208ran(e(T)m2) = dom( Tm2)\u2229ran(Tm2).\nWith the operators rn[T] in (3.16) we now de\ufb01ne the vectors vn:=rn[T]m1v,n\u2208N. Then\nby (3.17) and the fact that ran(T) =Vby Theorem 3.3 ii), there converges\nlim\nn\u2192\u221evn=v. (4.16)\nBy (4.7) there is vn\u2208dom/parenleftbig\n(fem1)(T)e(T)\u2212m1/parenrightbig\n, which means that with the operator inclu-\nsions (4.15) and with e(T)\u2212m2rn[T]m1\u2287rn[T]m1e(T)\u2212m2, we can write\n(fem1)(T)e(T)\u2212m1vn= (fem2)(T)e(T)\u2212m2vn= (fem2)(T)rn[T]m1e(T)\u2212m2v.\nUsing once more the convergence\nlim\nn\u2192\u221ern[T]m1e(T)\u2212m2v=e(T)\u2212m2v,\nfrom (3.17) with the value u=e(T)\u2212m2v, we conclude from the boundedness of the operator\n(fem2)(T), that there converges\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e(fem1)(T)e(T)\u2212m1vn= (fem2)(T)e(T)\u2212m2v.

This proves that the graph of the operator\n(fem2)(T)e(T)\u2212m2is contained in\ngraph/parenleftbig\n(fem2)(T)e(T)\u2212m2/parenrightbig\n\u2286(fem1)(T)e(T)\u2212m1,\nand hence also the closure (in the sense of multivalued opera tors) is contained in\n(fem2)(T)e(T)\u2212m2\u2286(fem1)(T)e(T)\u2212m1. /square\n\n16 FABRIZIO COLOMBO, FRANCESCO MANTOVANI, AND P.

(4.18)\nMoreover, for every f\u2208 SHpoly\nR(D\u03b8),\u03b8\u2208(\u03c9,\u03c0\n2), the right H\u221e-functional calculus (4.13) has\nthe following properties:\ni\u2019)f(T) is a closed, right linear multivalued operator;\nii\u2019) For every g\u2208 SH0\nR(D\u03b8) anda\u2208Rn, it satis\ufb01es the linearity properties\n(f+g)(T) =f(T)+g(T) and ( af)(T) =af(T). (4.19)\nProof.Throughout this proof lat e(s) =sm\n(1+s2)mbe a regularizer of faccording to De\ufb01ni-\ntion 4.4 or De\ufb01nition 4.7 respectively.\ni) Since the left H\u221e-functional calculus (4.3) is the product of a closed and a bo unded right\nlinear operator, f(T) is a closed and right linear operator as well.\nii) Since g\u2208 SH0\nL(D\u03b8), the function eis a regularizer of the sum f+gas well. It then follows\nfrom the de\ufb01nition (4.3) of the left H\u221e-functional calculus, that\n(f+g)(T) =e(T)\u22121(e(f+g))(T) =e(T)\u22121((ef)(T)+e(T)g(T))\n=e(T)\u22121(ef)(T)+g(T) =f(T)+g(T).\nThe second part of the linearity in (4.18) follows from\n(fa)(T) =e(T)\u22121(fa)(T) =e(T)\u22121(ef)(T)a=f(T)a.\ni\u2019)f(T) is de\ufb01ned as a closure and hence a closed, right linear multi valued operator.\nii\u2019) Thesecondpartofthelinearity in(4.19)followsdirec tlyfromthede\ufb01nition(4.13), namely\n(af)(T) =(afe)(T)e(T)\u22121=a(fe)(T)e(T)\u22121=af(T).\nFor the additive linearity in (4.18), we \ufb01rst note that due to g\u2208 SH0\nR(D\u03b8), the function eis\na regularizer of the sum f+gas well. In order to prove \u201c \u2286\u201c, we know from the linearity of\nthe\u03c9-functional calculus, that\n((f+g)e)(T)e(T)\u22121= ((fe)(T)+g(T)e(T))e(T)\u22121\n= (fe)(T)e(T)\u22121+g(T)e(T)e(T)\u22121\n\u2286(fe)(T)e(T)\u22121+g(T) =f(T)+g(T).\nSince the right hand side is the sum of the closed multivalued operator f(T) and the bounded\noperator g(T), it is a closed multivalued operator as well. Hence there fo llows\n(f+g)(T) =((f+g)e)(T)e(T)\u22121\u2286f(T)+g(T).\nFor theinverse inclusion\u201c \u2287\u201c let (v,w)\u2208f(T)+g(T). Sinceg(T) is a boundedoperator, this\nmeans by the de\ufb01nition of the sum of multivalued operators in (2.3), that ( v,w\u2212g(T)v)\u2208\n\n17\nf(T). Moreover, by the de\ufb01nition of f(T) as the closure (4.13), there exists a sequence\n(vn)n\u2208dom/parenleftbig\n(fe)(T)e(T)\u22121/parenrightbig\n= ran(e(T)), such that\nv= lim\nn\u2192\u221evnandw\u2212g(T)v= lim\nn\u2192\u221e(fe)(T)e(T)\u22121vn.

These are function spaces of nonholomorphic fun ctions derived\nfrom the Fueter-Sce extension theorem, which connects slic e hyperholomorphic and axially\nmonogenic functions, the two main notions of holomorphicit y in the Cli\ufb00ord setting. The\nconnection is established through powers of the Laplace ope rator in a higher dimension, see\n[34, 44, 46] and also the translation [25].\nThe \ufb01ne structures on the S-spectrum constitute a set of function spaces and their rela ted\nfunctional calculi. These structures have been introduced and studied in recent works [14,\n15, 29, 30], while their respective H\u221e-versions are investigated in [24, 31].\n\n20 FABRIZIO COLOMBO, FRANCESCO MANTOVANI, AND P. SCHLOSSER\nUnlike complex holomorphic function theory, the noncommut ative setting of the Cli\ufb00ord alge-\nbra allows multiple notions of hyperholomorphicity for vec tor \ufb01elds. Consequently, di\ufb00erent\nspectral theories emerge, each based on theconcept of spect rum that relies on distinct Cauchy\nkernels. The spectral theory based on the S-spectrum was inspired by quaternionic quantum\nmechanics (see [12]), is associated with slice hyperholomo rphicity, and began its development\nin 2006. A comprehensive introduction can be found in [20], w ith further explorations done\nin [4, 5, 26]. Applications on fractional powers of operator s are investigated in [16, 17, 18]\nand some results from classical interpolation theory, see [ 10, 13, 41, 47], have been recently\nextended into this setting [27]. In order to fully appreciat e the spectral theory on the S-\nspectrum, we recall that it applies to sets of noncommuting o perators, for example with the\nidenti\ufb01cation ( T1,...,T2n)\u2194T=/summationtext\nATAeAit can be seen as a theory for several operators.\nIt is important to highlight that in the hypercomplex settin g there exists another spectral\ntheory based on the monogenic spectrum, which was initiated by Je\ufb00eries and McIntosh in\n[40]. This theory is founded on monogenic functions, which a re functions in the kernel of the\nDirac operator, and their associated Cauchy formula (see [2 8] for a comprehensive treatment).\nThe monogenic spectral theory has been extensively develop ed and is well described in the\nseminal works of Je\ufb00eries [36] and Tao [45]. These texts provi de an in-depth exploration of\nthe theory, with particular emphasis on the H\u221e-functional calculus in the monogenic setting.\nThe idea of the corresponding regularization procedure has been introduced by A. McIntosh\nin [43] and further explored in various studies as [6, 7, 8, 33 ]. It is extensively used in the\ninvestigation of evolution equations, particularly in max imal regularity and fractional powers\nof di\ufb00erential operators. Additionally, there exists a clos e relation to Kato\u2019s square root\nproblem and pseudo-di\ufb00erential operators.\nDeclarations and statements\nData availability .

Tracer and granular gas particles are\nin general mechanically di\ufb00erent. Our approach uses a serie s representation of the MSD where the\nk-th term is given in terms of the mean scalar product /an}bracketle{tr1\u00b7rk/an}bracketri}ht, withridenoting the displacements\nof the tracer between successive collisions. We \ufb01nd that thi s series approximates a geometric series\nwith the ratio \u2126. We derive an explicit analytical expressio n of \u2126 for granular gases in three\ndimensions, and validate it through a comparison with the nu merical results obtained from the\ndirect simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. Our compariso n covers a wide range of masses,\nsizes, and inelasticities. From the geometric series, we \ufb01n d that the MSD per collision is simply given\nby the mean-square free path of the particle divided by 1 \u2212\u2126. The analytical expression for the MSD\nderived here is compared with DSMC data and with the \ufb01rst- and second-Sonine approximations\nto the MSD obtained from the Chapman-Enskog solution of the B oltzmann equation. Surprisingly,\ndespite their simplicity, our results outperform the predi ctions of the \ufb01rst-Sonine approximation to\nthe MSD, achieving accuracy comparable to the second-Sonin e approximation.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn two articles published in 1906 (one on the kinetic\ntheory of di\ufb00usion in molecular gases [1] and the other\non the kinetic theory of Brownian motion [2]; the for-\nmer complementing Einstein\u2019s famous 1905 article on\nthe same subject [3]), Smoluchowski pioneered the use of\ntools from what is now recognized as random walk the-\nory (or stochastic processes) to determine, among other\nthings, the di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient of a tracer (or intruder)\nparticle in a molecular gas. Smoluchowski\u2019s results are\nbased on two main assumptions. First, it is assumed\nthat if the tracer particle is immersed in a dilute gas, its\nmean free path is much larger than the size of the gas\nmolecules. Second, it is further assumed that the tracer\nparticle scatters isotropically after colliding with other\nmolecules (an assumption that is not acceptable even to\na \ufb01rst approximation if the tracer is Brownian, namely,\nwhen it is much more massive than the gas molecules).\nUnder these assumptions, the MSD of the tracerparticle,/angbracketleftbig\nR2/angbracketrightbig\n, afterNcollisions is given by\n/angbracketleftbig\nR2/angbracketrightbig\n= 2N\u221dan}bracketle{tr\u221dan}bracketri}ht2, (1)\n\u2217santos@unex.es; https://\ufb01steor.cms.unex.es/investiga dores/\nsantos-bravo-yuste/\n\u2020ruben@unex.es\n\u2021vicenteg@unex.es; https://\ufb01steor.cms.unex.es/investi gadores/\nvicente-garzo-puertos/where\u221dan}bracketle{tr\u221dan}bracketri}htis the mean free path ( ris the free path).

(3)\nExpression (3) is nothing more than the expression\nof the di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient given by the elementary ki-\nnetic theory, traceable back to Boltzmann, and found in\nstandard textbooks [4]. In Ref. [2], Smoluchowski fur-\nther noted that the tracer particle, after colliding with a\ngas molecule (especially if the tracer particle is heavy),\ntends to be scattered in a direction similar to the direc-\ntion it was carrying before the collision. This is known\nas persistence of the collisions. This fact explains why\nthe elementary formula (3) is only a \ufb01rst approximation.\nSmoluchowskidaredinRef.[2]tomakeanestimateofthe\ncorrection to the MSD due to persistence by introducing\nin his analysis the mean value of the angle at which the\ndirection of motion of the particle changes in each col-\nlision. As Smoluchowski himself pointed out (section 7\nof Ref. [1]), Jeans had already observed in 1904 [5] that\nconsideration of the existence of persistence in collisions\nwas necessary for a better microscopic explanation of the\n\n2\nproperties of gases and, in particular, for a better esti-\nmate of the tracer di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient [6].\nTo the best of our knowledge, the \ufb01rst rigorous ana-\nlyisis of the MSD of a particle in a gas by means of a\nrandom walk approach was addressed by Yang in 1949\n[7]. The MSD is de\ufb01ned as\n/angbracketleftbig\nR2/angbracketrightbig\n=\u221dan}bracketle{tR\u00b7R\u221dan}bracketri}ht=N/summationdisplay\ni=1N/summationdisplay\nj=1\u221dan}bracketle{tri\u00b7rj\u221dan}bracketri}ht, (4)\nwhererjare the displacements of the particle between\nsuccessive collisions and R=/summationtextN\ni=1riis the displace-\nment of the particle after Ncollisions.

In\nterms of the mean free time \u03c4=t/N, the MSD can be\nrewritten as/angbracketleftbig\nR2/angbracketrightbig\n=/angbracketleftbig\nr2/angbracketrightbig\nt/\u03c4, which yields the following\nexpression of the di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient D:\nD=/angbracketleftbig\nR2/angbracketrightbig\n6t=/angbracketleftbig\nr2/angbracketrightbig\n6\u03c4\u2261DeRW. (5)\nWhile very similar, this expression DeRWfor the dif-\nfusion coe\ufb03cient is not exactly equal to DeKT. This is\nbecause\u221dan}bracketle{tr\u221dan}bracketri}ht\u221dan}bracketle{tv\u221dan}bracketri}htis not exactly equal to/angbracketleftbig\nr2/angbracketrightbig\n/(2\u03c4) =\u221dan}bracketle{trv\u221dan}bracketri}ht\n(see Sec. V of Ref. [8]). Just as Smoluchowski in Ref.\n[2] improved the estimation of the di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient by\nincluding the e\ufb00ects of persistence, the elementary ex-\npression (5) for Dcan also be improved if the persistence\nin collisions (which implies \u221dan}bracketle{tri\u00b7rj\u221dan}bracketri}ht \u221dne}ationslash= 0) is accounted\nfor. Unfortunately, as said before, Yang\u2019s estimate of the\nterms with i\u221dne}ationslash=jfor a gas of elastic hard spheres was de-\n\ufb01cient. This is understandable given the computational\nlimitations in the late 1940s when Yang carried out the\ncalculations for his article. The \ufb01rst three terms with\ni\u221dne}ationslash=j(i.e.,\u221dan}bracketle{tr1\u00b7r2\u221dan}bracketri}ht,\u221dan}bracketle{tr1\u00b7r3\u221dan}bracketri}htand\u221dan}bracketle{tr1\u00b7r4\u221dan}bracketri}ht) for the case\nof an elastic hard sphere gas have recently been calcu-\nlated in Ref. [8]. In this paper, it was observed that the\ncorrections due to the persistence of collisions to the el-\nementary value DeRWof the di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient decay,\nin a very good approximation, exponentially. The factor\nby which these terms decrease is very well approximated\nby the quantity known in kinetic theory of gases as the\nmean-persistence ratio \u221dan}bracketle{t\u03c9\u221dan}bracketri}ht[9]. This result led us to pro-\nposeinRef.[8]thefollowingexpressionfortheMSDafter\nNcollisions:\n/angbracketleftbig\nR2/angbracketrightbig\n=N/angbracketleftbig\nr2/angbracketrightbig\n1\u2212\u221dan}bracketle{t\u03c9\u221dan}bracketri}ht. (6)\nFrom Eqs. (5) and (6), and N=t/\u03c4, one gets\nD=DeRW\n1\u2212\u221dan}bracketle{t\u03c9\u221dan}bracketri}ht. (7)The expression (6) for the di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient (or equiv-\nalently for the MSD) substantially improve the corre-\nsponding elementary expressions. In fact, they provide\nresults comparable to the standard results of the kinetic\ntheory of gases derived from the Chapman-Enskog solu-\ntion of the Boltzmann equation [8] .\nThe aim of the present work is to generalize the argu-\nments used in Ref. [8] for calculating the MSD in molec-\nular gases to granular gases. It is well known that, under\nrapid \ufb02ow conditions, a granular gas can be modeled as\na gas of hard spheres with inelastic collisions. If the\nspheres are assumed to be perfectly smooth, the inelas-\nticity in collisions is accounted for only by a constant\ncoe\ufb03cient of normal restitution 0 < \u03b1\u22641. When \u03b1= 1,\nthe collisions are elastic. In a binary collision in the in-\nelastic hard sphere model, the tangential component of\nthe relative velocity of the two colliding spheres remains\nunchanged, while its normal component is shrunk by a\nfactor\u03b1. Since in our problem the tracer and the parti-\ncles ofthe granulargasare in generalmechanicallydi\ufb00er-\nent, there are two di\ufb00erent coe\ufb03cients of restitution: \u03b1\n(associated with the collisions between the granular par-\nticles themselves) and \u03b10(associated with the collisions\nbetween the tracer and the particles of the granular gas).\nAs in Ref. [8], our goal here is to determine the di\ufb00u-\nsion of a tracer particle moving in a freely cooling gran-\nular gas. In this homogeneous state (which is referred\nto as the HCS in the granular literature [10, 11]) the\ngrains collide freely and cool accordingly. However, one\nof the most characteristic features of granular gases (as\ncompared to conventional molecular gases) is the spon-\ntaneous formation of velocity vortices and density clus-\nters in freely cooling \ufb02ows [12, 13]. The instability of the\nHCS canbewelldescribed byalinearstabilityanalysisof\nthe granular version of the Navier\u2013Stokes hydrodynamic\nequations [14\u201321]. The analysis clearly shows that the\norigin of the above instability is related to inelasticity in\ncollisions,andsinceitislimitedtosmallwavenumbers, it\ncan be avoided for su\ufb03ciently small systems. The study\nof di\ufb00usion in freely cooling granular gases provided in\nthis paper is limited to situations where the HCS is sta-\nble and thus the granular gas maintains its homogeneous\nstate.\nAs previously mentioned, in this article we analyze the\ndi\ufb00usion of a tracer granular particle in a granular gas\nunder HCS using a procedure that views the motion of\nthe tracer particle as a random walk. It is important\nto remark that this procedure for inelastic collisions is\nfundamentally di\ufb00erent from the one followed in gran-\nular kinetic theory [11] when one extends the conven-\ntional Chapman\u2013Enskog method [9] to granular gases.\nIn this paper, we will compare our \ufb01ndings derived from\nrandom walk arguments with (i) previous theoretical re-\nsults [22, 23] for the tracer di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient derived\nfrom the Chapman\u2013Enskog solution in the so-called \ufb01rst\nand second Sonine approximations, and with (ii) our\ncomputer simulation results obtained from the DSMC\nmethod [24].\n\n3\nThe organization of the article is as follows. In Sec. II,\nwe describe the system (granulargasplus tracer particle)\nwe are interested in and give some known relationships\nthat will be used throughout this paper. The MSD of\nthe tracer particle in terms of its elementary displace-\nments (or free paths) riis given in Sec. III and evaluated\nin Sec. IV. In this section it is shown that the MSD\ncan be approximated by a geometric series (which we\ncall the collisional series) where the ratio between the\nsuccessive terms is expressed by means of averages that\ninvolve the velocities before and after the collision and\nthe scattering angles. For inelastic collisions, this ratio is\nthe mean-persistence ratio \u221dan}bracketle{t\u03c9\u221dan}bracketri}htof kinetic theory of gases.\nIn Sec. V, we provide a theoretical expression, denoted\nby \u2126, to estimate the collisional series ratio for a tracer\nparticle moving in a granulargas in HCS. Computer sim-\nulation results obtained from the DSMC method [24] are\npresented in Sec. VI. These simulation data are used to\nvalidate that the collisional series closely approximates a\ngeometric series and that \u2126 accurately predicts its ratio.\nWe also compare the MSD derived from \u2126 with simula-\ntion data, \ufb01nding surprisingly good agreement between\ntheory and simulation. In Sec. VII, we further com-\npare the theoretical and computational results derived\nhere with those previously obtained [22] by solving the\nBoltzmann\u2013Lorentzequation by means ofthe Chapman\u2013\nEnskog method [9]. We end the paper in Sec. VIII where\nwe collect some conclusions, remarks, and possible exten-\nsions of this work.\nII. TRACER PARTICLE MOVING IN A\nGRANULAR GAS UNDER HCS\nWe consider a physical system consisting of a tracer\n(or intruder) particle immersed in a granular gas. Both\nthe tracer and particles of the granular gas are modeled\nas a gas of hard spheres with inelastic collisions. The\nintruder may be identical to or di\ufb00erent from the gas\nparticles (grains). The granular gas is assumed to be in\nHCS, namely, a homogeneous state where the granular\ntemperature Tdecreases in time. Detailed descriptions\nand relevant equations are provided in Refs. [11, 25].\nWe denote the mass and diameter of the granular gas\nparticles as mand\u03c3, respectively, and those of the in-\ntruder as m0and\u03c30. Throughout this article, we use\nthe convention that intruder-related quantities are indi-\ncated by a subscript 0. Accordingly, the inelasticity of\ncollisions between granular gas particles is quanti\ufb01ed by\nthe coe\ufb03cient of normal restitution \u03b1, while the inelas-\nticity for intruder-gas collisions is characterized by the\ncoe\ufb03cient of normal restitution \u03b10.\nDue to the inelastic character of collisions, the mean\nkinetic energy (granulartemperature) ofthe granulargas\ndecays with time. Its evolution equation is [10, 11]\n\u2202tlnT(t) =\u2212\u03b6(t), (8)\nwhere\u03b6is the cooling rate. This quantity gives the rateof energy dissipation due to inelastic collisions. Since for\ninelastic hard spheres \u03b6(t)\u221d/radicalbig\nT(t), the integration of\nEq. (8) yields Ha\ufb00\u2019s law [26]:\nT(t) =T(0)\n(1+t/t\u03b6)2, (9)\nwhereT(0) is the initial temperature, t\u03b6= 2/\u03b6(0) is the\ncharacteristic cooling time, and \u03b6(0) is the cooling rate\natt= 0. The partial temperature T0(t) of the tracer\nparticle is a relevant quantity at a kinetic level as it\nprovides a measure of its mean kinetic energy. In the\nHCS,T0(t)\u221dT(t) but the temperature ratio T0(t)/T(t)\nremains constant in time and, in general, is di\ufb00erent\nfrom 1 (breakdown of kinetic energy assumption) [27].\nThe condition for determining the temperature ratio is\n\u03b6(t) =\u03b60(t), where \u03b60is the partial cooling rate associ-\nated with T0. Given that both cooling rates are given in\ntermsofthedistributionfunctionsofthegranulargasand\nthe tracer particles (whose exactly forms are not known\nto date), one usually approximates these distributions\nby their Maxwellian forms. In this approximation and in\nterms of the auxiliary parameter\n\u03b2=m0T\nmT0, (10)\nthe temperature ratio is the unique positive root of the\nequation [25, 27]:\n1\u2212\u03b12\nd=2\u221a\n2\nd\u00b5\u03c70\n\u03c7/parenleftBig\u00af\u03c3\n\u03c3/parenrightBigd\u22121/parenleftbigg1+\u03b2\n\u03b2/parenrightbigg1/2\n(1+\u03b10)\n\u00d7/bracketleftbigg\n1\u22121\n2\u00b5(1+\u03b2)(1+\u03b10)/bracketrightbigg\n. (11)\nHere,dis the dimensionality of the system ( d= 3 for\nspheres and d= 2 for disks), and \u03c7and\u03c70are the pair\ncorrelation functions at contact for the granular gas and\nthe intruder-gas particles, respectively. Moreover,\n\u00b5=m\nm+m0, (12)\n\u00af\u03c3=\u03c3+\u03c30\n2. (13)\nNotethat Eq.(11)canbe convertedintoacubic equation\nfor\u03b2, allowing for an explicit, albeit cumbersome, solu-\ntion. Nevertheless, the numerical resolution of Eq. (11)\nis straightforward and e\ufb03cient. From Eqs. (9)-(11) one\n\ufb01nds the intruder\u2019s temperature,\nT0(t) =T0(0)\n(1+t/t\u03b6)2. (14)\nA decrease in the gas temperature (mean kinetic en-\nergy and, consequently, mean velocity) implies that the\n(average) collision frequencies \u03bd(t) and\u03bd0(t) for grain-\ngrain and intruder-grain collisions, respectively, are de-\ncreasing functions of time. The collision frequency \u03bd(t)\n\n4\nis given by [11]\n\u03bd(t) =\u221a\n2\u03c0(d\u22121)/2\n\u0393/parenleftbigd\n2/parenrightbign\u03c3d\u22121\u03c7vth(t) (15)\nwherendenotes the number density of the granular gas\nparticles and\nvth=/radicalbigg\n2T(t)\nm(16)\nis the thermal velocity. The expression (15) for \u03bdis iden-\ntical to that for molecular (elastic) gases, except that for\ngranular gases the thermal velocity decreases over time\ndue to the inelastic nature of collisions. The intruder-\ngrain collision frequency \u03bd0(t) is well approximated by\nthe relation [25]\n\u03bd0(t) = \u03a5\u03bd(t) (17)\nwhere\n\u03a5 =/parenleftBig\u00af\u03c3\n\u03c3/parenrightBigd\u22121\u03c70\n\u03c7/parenleftbigg1+\u03b2\n2\u03b2/parenrightbigg1/2\n. (18)\nFrom the collision frequency \u03bd0(t), we obtain the aver-\nage number of collisions in time t:\ns0(t) =/integraldisplayt\n0\u03bd0(t\u2032)dt\u2032= \u03a5s(t), (19)\nwhere\ns(t) =/integraldisplayt\n0\u03bd(t\u2032)dt\u2032(20)\nis the mean number of collisions experienced by a gran-\nular gas particle with the other particles of the granular\ngas during time t. An explicit expression for \u03bd(t) is ob-\ntained by using Ha\ufb00\u2019s law (9) in the thermal velocity\nexpression (16). Integration of Eq. (15) yields\ns(t) =2\u03bd(0)\n\u03b6(0)ln/parenleftbigg\n1+\u03b6(0)\n2\u03bd(0)t\u2217/parenrightbigg\n=t\u03b6\n\u03c4(0)ln(1+t/t\u03b6)\n(21)\nwheret\u2217=\u03bd(0)t=t/\u03c4(0) is the time in units of the\ninitial intercollisional time \u03c4(0) =\u03bd(t= 0)\u22121of the gas\nparticles. From Eqs. (19) and (21) we obtain the mean\nnumber of intruder collisions up to time t:\ns0(t) =t\u03b6\n\u03c40(0)ln(1+t/t\u03b6) (22)\nwhere\u03c40(0) = 1/\u03bd0(0) is the initial mean collision time\nbetween the intruder and the gas particles. A good ap-\nproximation for t\u03b6is given by t\u03b6/\u03c4(0) = 2d/(1\u2212\u03b12) [25],\nwhich, from Eq. (17), implies\nt\u03b6\n\u03c40(0)= \u03a5t\u03b6\n\u03c4(0)=2d\u03a5\n1\u2212\u03b12. (23)On the other hand, the Maxwell mean free path [28]\n\u2113Mis de\ufb01ned as\n\u2113M\u2261\u00afv(t)\n\u03bd(t), (24)\nwhere \u00afv\u2261 \u221dan}bracketle{tv\u221dan}bracketri}htdenotes the average speed modulus. The\nMaxwell mean free path of the particles of the granu-\nlar gas has the same form as for conventional molecular\n(elastic) gases:\n\u2113M=\u00afv(t)\n\u03bd(t)=\u0393/parenleftbigd+1\n2/parenrightbig\n\u221a\n2\u03c0(d\u22121)/21\nn\u03c3d\u22121\u03c7.(25)\nAnalogoulsy, the Maxwell mean free path of the intruder,\n\u21130M\u2261\u00afv0(t)/\u03bd0(t), is given by [25]\n\u21130M=\u2113M\n\u03a5\u221a\u03b2. (26)\nIII. THE INTRUDER AS A RANDOM\nWALKER. MEAN SQUARE DISPLACEMENT\nTaking the intruder\u2019s position R(t= 0) immediately\nafter a collision as the initial position and this collision\ntime ast= 0, the intruder\u2019s position after Ncollisions\nisRN=/summationtextN\ni=1ri, whereriis thei-th displacement be-\ntween the i-th and ( i\u22121)-th collisions (with the initial\ncollision labeled as 0). As usual, the intruder di\ufb00usion\nis quanti\ufb01ed by the variance of its position after time t.\nWith no external forces, the mean position is \u221dan}bracketle{tR(t)\u221dan}bracketri}ht= 0,\nso the variance is simply \u221dan}bracketle{tR2\u221dan}bracketri}ht.\nTo evaluate the intruder\u2019s position variance \u221dan}bracketle{tR2(t)\u221dan}bracketri}htaf-\nter time t, we begin by considering the variance after N\ndisplacements (or equivalently, steps or collisions):\n/angbracketleftbig\nR2\nN/angbracketrightbig\n=\u221dan}bracketle{tRN\u00b7RN\u221dan}bracketri}ht\n=N/summationdisplay\ni=1\u221dan}bracketle{tri\u00b7ri\u221dan}bracketri}ht+ 2N\u22121/summationdisplay\ni=1\u221dan}bracketle{tri\u00b7ri+1\u221dan}bracketri}ht+ 2N\u22122/summationdisplay\ni=1\u221dan}bracketle{tri\u00b7ri+2\u221dan}bracketri}ht\n+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 (27)\nIn a HCS state, free paths between collisions are time-\nindependent (see Sec. VII), so that\n\u221dan}bracketle{tR2\nN\u221dan}bracketri}ht=N\u221dan}bracketle{tr1\u00b7r1\u221dan}bracketri}ht+2(N\u22121)\u221dan}bracketle{tr1\u00b7r2\u221dan}bracketri}ht+2(N\u22122)\u221dan}bracketle{tr1\u00b7r3\u221dan}bracketri}ht\n+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\n=N\u221dan}bracketle{tr1\u00b7r1\u221dan}bracketri}ht+2N\u22121/summationdisplay\nk=1(N\u2212k)\u221dan}bracketle{tr1\u00b7r1+k\u221dan}bracketri}ht.(28)\nEquation (28) can be rewritten as\n\u221dan}bracketle{tR2\nN\u221dan}bracketri}ht=N\u21132\ne (29)\nwhere\u2113eis the e\ufb00ective free path. This name is justi\ufb01ed\nbecause the MSD of a walk with Nisotropic, uncorre-\nlated steps of \ufb01xed size \u2113eis exactly given by Eq. (29).\n\n5\nNote that \u21132\neis the MSD of the intruder per collision.\nComparing Eq. (29) with Eq. (28), the e\ufb00ective free path\ncan be approximated by\n\u21132\ne\u2248 \u221dan}bracketle{tr2\n1\u221dan}bracketri}ht+2\u221dan}bracketle{tr1\u00b7r2\u221dan}bracketri}ht+2\u221dan}bracketle{tr1\u00b7r3\u221dan}bracketri}ht+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.(30)\nfor large N. Upon writing Eq.(30) we haveassumedthat\nstepsr1andrkdecorrelate rapidly enough that the error\nin the approximation\n(N\u2212k\u22121)\u221dan}bracketle{tr1\u00b7rk\u221dan}bracketri}ht \u2248N\u221dan}bracketle{tr1\u00b7rk\u221dan}bracketri}ht(31)\nis negligible even for large k. This assumption holds ex-\ncept for extreme cases where the mass ratio m0/mis\nlarge and the diameter ratio \u03c30/\u03c3is small (see Sec.

This point will be\ndiscussed in Sec. VI.\nIt is convenient to rewrite Eq.

We call collisional series to the se-\nries in Eq. (30) and reducedcollisional series to/summationtext\u221e\nn=1cn.\nIn summary, Eqs. (29) and (32) tell us that the MSD of\nthe intruder per step, \u221dan}bracketle{tR2\nN\u221dan}bracketri}ht/N, is the mean square free\npath,\u221dan}bracketle{tr2\u221dan}bracketri}ht, corrected by the reduced collisional series.\nAs stated in Sec. I, neglecting collision persistence\n(i.e., assuming isotropic post-collision scattering) leads\nto\u221dan}bracketle{tri\u00b7rj\u221dan}bracketri}ht= 0 fori\u221dne}ationslash=j. In this approximation, one gets\nthe elementary MSD/angbracketleftbig\nR2\nN/angbracketrightbig\n=N/angbracketleftbig\nr2/angbracketrightbig\n. Thus, the reduced\ncollisional series corrects the elementary MSD to yield\nthe correct MSD. In this context, the reduced collisional\nseries quantify the impact of the collision persistence on\nthe MSD of the intruder.\nFinally, to relate \u221dan}bracketle{tR2(t)\u221dan}bracketri}htand\u221dan}bracketle{tR2\nN\u221dan}bracketri}ht, we consider the\nprobability density function (pdf) of the intruder\u2019s posi-\ntionRat timet:\nP(R,t) =\u221e/summationdisplay\nN=0PN(R)\u03beN(t). (34)\nHere,PN(R) is the pdf of the position of the walker after\nNsteps and \u03beN(t) is the probability of taking exactly N\nsteps by time t. Substituting Eq.

II.\nIV. MSD AS A GEOMETRIC SERIES\nSinces0(t) is known [see Eq. (22)], Eq.

Exact evaluation of these quan-\ntities, even for small kand molecular (elastic) gases,\nis challenging (see Ref. [8] for more details). Unfortu-\nnately, the method used in Ref. [8] to rigorously com-\npute these quantities cannot be used for granular gases\nbecause detailed balance is not satis\ufb01ed when the colli-\nsions between the particles are inelastic.

To do this, we will follow similar steps to those\nused in Ref. [8] when collisions are elastic.

(52)\nEquation (51) [or (52)] is a fundamental equation in\nthis work. It tells us how the MSD of the tracer (or in-\ntruder)particledi\ufb00ersfromthatofaparticlescatteredby\ncollisions with equiprobable spatial re-emission.

Equation (51)\nshows us that the particle\u2019s persistence in maintaining\nits direction after collisions results in a positively corre-\nlated randomwalk, resulting in an actualMSD exceeding\nthat without persistence.\nA. M. Smoluchowski and J. H. Jeans\nThe stochastic, random walk procedure, where we fol-\nlow the particle of interest (intruder) and treat each col-\nlision as a random event, comes from M. Smoluchowski,\na pioneer in what we now call stochastic processes. This\nis the approach we have used here. Although there are\nsome di\ufb00erences between our method and the method\nof Smoluchowski, there are also strong similarities (see\nSec. 11 of Ref. [2]). Smoluchowski assumed a constant\nscattering angle \u03b8(which he denotes as \u03b5), and a \ufb01xed\nfree path length l(l\u2261r1=r2=...= const.). A recur-\nrence relation between/angbracketleftbig\nR2\nN/angbracketrightbig\nand/angbracketleftbig\nR2(N\u22121)/angbracketrightbig\nwas then\nfound, yielding exactly Eq. (51) for large N, if we equate\n\u2126 with cos \u03b5and/angbracketleftbig\nr2/angbracketrightbig\nwith 2l2.\nOn the other hand, J. H. Jeans knew (see Sec. 168 of\nRef. [6]) that collision persistence had to be considered\nfor a more accurate description of molecular di\ufb00usion in\n\n7\ngases. Smoluchowski was also aware of this: see Sec. 7\nof Ref. [1], where Jeans\u2019 article [5] is referenced. Taking\ncollision persistence into account, Jeans suggested the\nimproved formula D=DeKT/(1\u2212\u03c9) (for elastic colli-\nsions only), identifying \u03c9as the mean-persistence ratio.\nHowever, Jeans did not connect his formula with Smolu-\nchowski\u2019s, i.e., the parameter \u03c9(which he denotes as \u03b8)\nis an estimate of Smoluchowski\u2019s cos \u03b5.\nBased on the preceding discussion, it might be ap-\npropriate to refer to our equation (51) as the inelastic\nSmoluchowski-Jeans equation.\nB. Connection to Polymer Physics\nThe trajectory of a particle (the intruder) after Ncol-\nlisions,{r1,r2,...,rN}, can be viewed as a polymer con-\n\ufb01guration with N+1 monomers, where riis the vector\nconnecting monomer itoi\u22121 (monomers are placed at\nintruder collision points). From this viewpoint, readers\nfamiliar with polymer physics will recognize our e\ufb00ective\nfree path \u2113e, de\ufb01ned by Eq. (29), as the Kuhn length\n[29]. Furthermore, if we identify/angbracketleftbig\nr2/angbracketrightbig\nwith the square of\nthe bond length, then/angbracketleftbig\nR2/angbracketrightbig\n/(N/angbracketleftbig\nr2/angbracketrightbig\n) [see Eq.(32)] is the\nFlory characteristic ratio in polymer physics.\nFrom equation (48), we learn that the correlation be-\ntween collisions decay exponentially:\n\u221dan}bracketle{tr1\u00b7r1+n\u221dan}bracketri}ht \u223c\u2126n= exp[nln\u2126] = exp[ \u2212n/\u02dcn] (53)\nwhere\n\u02dcn=\u22121/ln\u2126 (54)\nare the persistence collisions. Borrowingthe terminology\nemployed to de\ufb01ne persistence length in polymers (see\nRef. [30], Sec. 2.3), persistence collisions \u02dc ncanroughly\nbe considered as the maximun number of collisions that\nthe intruder can have while its trajectory {r1,r2,...,r\u02dcn}\nremains roughly straight; at greater number of collisions,\nthe bending of the rkconnections destroy the memory of\nthe trajectory direction. A more detailed discussion on\npersistence collisions for elastic collisions is given at the\nend of section IV of Ref. [8].\nC. MSD regimes with respecto to Nand time\nAlthough this article primarily focus on intruder di\ufb00u-\nsioninthelong-time(orhighnumberofcollisions)regime\n[where Equations (50) and (51) hold], in this subsection\nwe provide a brief qualitative overview of the MSD for\nother time regimes.\n1. Scaling of the MSD with the number of colisions\nIn the preceding subsection IVB, we established that\nthe trajectory approximates a straight line when thenumber of collisions Nis less than or of the order of\nthe persistence collisions \u02dc n. Consequently, for N/lessorsimilar\u02dcn,\nthe displacement Rscales linearly with N, leading to\n\u221dan}bracketle{tR2\u221dan}bracketri}ht \u223cN2. This outcome can also be deduced directly\nfrom Eq. (49): the condition for a quasi-ballistic trajec-\ntory over a substantial number of collisions requires \u2126\napproaching unity, as then \u02dc n=\u22121/ln\u2126\u22481/(1\u2212\u2126)\nbecomes relatively large. In this case, Eq. (49) becomes\n/angbracketleftbig\nR2\nN/angbracketrightbig\n\u221dan}bracketle{tr2\u221dan}bracketri}ht=N+N2\n2+N\u2212N3\n6(1\u2212\u2126)+O(1\u2212\u2126)2.(55)\nThis equation tell us that the MSD is ballistic, i.e.,/angbracketleftbig\nR2\nN/angbracketrightbig\ngrows as N2, for 1\u226aN\u226a\u02dcn. This ballistic regime\nceases when the N2term approaches the magnitude of\ntheN3(1\u2212\u2126) term, a condition satis\ufb01ed when N\u2248\n1/(1\u2212\u2126)\u2248\u02dcn. Consequently, for N\u226b\u02dcn, the ballistic\ndisplacement regime vanishes (as the bending of the rk\nconnections disrupts trajectory direction memory), and\nthedi\ufb00usiveregime,/angbracketleftbig\nR2\nN/angbracketrightbig\n\u223cN, asdescribedbyEq.(50),\nis established.\n2. Scaling of the the average number of collisions with time\nFrom Eq. (22), it is easy to see that s0\u223cln(t/t\u03b6)\nfort\u226bt\u03b6whiles0\u223ct/\u03c40(0) fort\u226at\u03b6. The phys-\nical meaning of this expression is clear. Equation (14)\nshows that the intruder\u2019s temperature (i.e., its velocity)\nchanges negligibly for t\u226at\u03b6. This occurs because en-\nergy loss from collisions with gas particles is minimal in\nthis regime, keeping the intruder\u2019s velocity close to its\ninitial value. Therefore, the number of collisions s0(t) is\nsimply the time over the mean collision time: t/\u03c40(0).\nAt times much greater than t\u03b6, the intruder\u2019s velocity\nand collision frequency have changed substantially from\ntheir initial values and both decay as t\u03b6/t. This results\nin a logarithmic growth s0\u223cln(t/t\u03b6) of the number of\ncollisions for t\u226bt\u03b6.\n3. Scaling of the MSD with time\nTo determine the detailed time dependence of the\nMSD for all times we should use Eq. (49) together with\nEq. (36). However, a simpler analysis is su\ufb03cient for our\npurposeofdeterminingthe scalingofthe MSDwith time.\nThus, we assume that the number of collisions Nup to\na giventis similar to its mean value, N\u2248 \u221dan}bracketle{tN\u221dan}bracketri}ht \u2261s0(t)\n(i.e., we assume that the variance of Nis small). This\nis equivalent to the approximation \u03beN(t)\u2248\u03b4(N\u2212s0(t))\nin equation (36), where \u03b4is the Dirac delta. In other\nwords, to estimate the MSD for all times we will use the\nrelationship\n/angbracketleftbig\nR2(t)/angbracketrightbig\n\u2248/angbracketleftBig\nR2\nN=s0(t)/angbracketrightBig\n(56)\nwith/angbracketleftbig\nR2\nN/angbracketrightbig\ngiven by Eq. (49).\n\n8\nObviously, for times less than or comparable to the\nmean collision time \u03c40(0), i.e., before the \ufb01rst colli-\nsion, the trajectory of the intruder is straight, and thus/angbracketleftbig\nR2(t)/angbracketrightbig\n\u223ct2. We will call this (trivial) temporal regime\nthe pre-collisional regime. But we know that, due to the\npersistenceofthecollisions,thetrayectoryoftheintruder\nremains roughly straight beyond the \ufb01rst collision for \u02dc n\ncollisions, i,e., until times oforderof t\u02dcnwheres0(t\u02dcn) = \u02dcn.\nThus, beyond the precollisional regime, we distinguish\nthree temporal regimes depending on the values of t\u02dcn\nandt\u03b6:\n1.Early time regime or ballistic regime: \u03c40(0)\u226at\u226a\nmin{t\u02dcn,t\u03b6}. In this case, (i) the movement of the\nintruder is roughly straight, \u221dan}bracketle{tR2\u221dan}bracketri}ht \u223cs2\n0, because\nt\u226at\u02dcnand (ii) s0(t)\u223ctbecause t\u226at\u03b6. These\ntwo facts imply ballistic motion, \u221dan}bracketle{tR2\u221dan}bracketri}ht \u223cs2\n0\u223ct2.\n2.Intermediate time regime. We distinguish two\ncases:\n(a)t\u02dcn\u226at\u226at\u03b6. Here the motion of the in-\ntruder is di\ufb00usive in the number of collisions,\n\u221dan}bracketle{tR2\u221dan}bracketri}ht \u223cs0, because t\u02dcn\u226at. Sinces0(t)\u223ct\nbecause t\u226at\u03b6, this implies \u221dan}bracketle{tR2\u221dan}bracketri}ht \u223cs0\u223ct,\ni.e., normal di\ufb00usive behavior. Note that this\nintermediate normal di\ufb00usive regime becomes\nthe\ufb01naldi\ufb00usive regime for ellastic collisions\nbecause, in this case, t\u03b6\u2192 \u221e[see Eq. (23)].\nThis normal di\ufb00usive regime has been studied\nin detail using our random walk approach in\nRef. [8].\n(b)t\u03b6\u226at\u226at\u02dcn. Here the motion of the intruder\nisballisticwithrespectotothenumberofcolli-\nsions,\u221dan}bracketle{tR2\u221dan}bracketri}ht \u223cs2\n0, because t\u226at\u02dcn. But, on the\nother hand, s0(t)\u223clntwhent\u03b6\u226at. Thus,\n\u221dan}bracketle{tR2\u221dan}bracketri}ht \u223cs2\n0\u223cln2t. Note that t\u03b6\u226at\u02dcnholds\nwhen\u03b1is not close to 1 [see Eq. (23)] and \u2126\nis very close to 1 [see Eq. (54)]. In Sec. V we\nwill show that \u2126 becomes closer to 1 as m0/m\nincreases and \u03c30/\u03c3decreases.\n3.Long-time regime: max{t\u02dcn,t\u03b6} \u226at. Here, again,\nthe motion is di\ufb00usive with respect to the num-\nber of collisions, \u221dan}bracketle{tR2\u221dan}bracketri}ht \u223cs0, because t\u02dcn\u226at. But\nnow the number of collisions decays logarithmi-\ncally,s0\u223clnt, because t\u03b6\u226at. This implies\n\u221dan}bracketle{tR2\u221dan}bracketri}ht \u223cs0\u223clnt, which is a subdi\ufb00usive behaviour\n(sometimes termed ultraslow as the MSD grows\nslower than any power of time).\nThe intermediate regime can not be detected when t\u02dcn\nandt\u03b6are similar. Furthermore, if these times are not\nmuch larger than \u03c40(0), the time dependence of the MSD\ndoes not exhibit the well-de\ufb01ned functional forms of the\n\ufb01rst two regimes, and only the long time subdi\ufb00usive\nregimeisclearlyobservable(asidefromthepre-collisional\nregime at very short times). This long-time temporal\nregime is main subject of this article, and it is the regimeto which Eqs. (50) and (51) apply. In Refs. [31\u201333], Bo-\ndrova et al. considered the all-time temporal evolution\nof the MSD for an intruder in a granular gas in the HCS\nstate (and also in granular gas mixtures). They provided\nan equation for the MSD at any instant and described\ntwo temporal regimes: ballistic for t\u226at\u03b6and subdif-\nfusive (logarithmic, ultraslow) for t\u03b6\u226at, although no\nintermediate temporal regime was identi\ufb01ed.\nAlthoughthe mechanismsandregimesidenti\ufb01ed di\ufb00er,\nthe presence of various regimes in the MSD has been\npreviously observed in MD simulations of freely cooling\nviscoelastic grains [34] and con\ufb01ned granular gases [35].\nV. PERSEVERANCE FOR INELASTIC HARD\nSPHERES\nOur main formula (51), or (52), tells us that collision\npersistence modi\ufb01es the MSD of a particle by a factor\n1/(1\u2212\u2126) relative to the MSD without persistence. To\nmake this equation useful, we need to determine the per-\nseverance \u2126 = \u221dan}bracketle{tv1/v2\u221dan}bracketri}ht\u03c9in terms of the parameter space\nof the system (intruder immersed in a granular gas in\nthe HCS). Since the mean-persistence ratio \u221dan}bracketle{t\u03c9\u221dan}bracketri}htis a di-\nmensionless quantity, it should be a function of the mass\nm0/mand diameter \u03c30/\u03c3ratios and the coe\ufb03cients of\nrestitution \u03b1and\u03b10. In the following two subsections,\nwe will provide expressions for the mean-persistence ra-\ntio\u221dan}bracketle{t\u03c9\u221dan}bracketri}htand the average pre- to post-collisional intruder\nvelocity ratio, \u221dan}bracketle{tv1/v2\u221dan}bracketri}ht, for this system.\nA. Mean-persistence ratio for inelastic hard\nspheres collisions\nThe mean-persistence ratio for elastic hard sphere col-\nlisions has been exactly calculated in Sec. 5.5 of Ref. [9].\nHowever, for inelastic collisions, the evaluation of \u221dan}bracketle{t\u03c9\u221dan}bracketri}htre-\nquires to take some approximations since the exact form\nof the velocity distributions of the intruder f0and gran-\nular gas particles fare not known to date [11]. As\nusual, to estimate \u221dan}bracketle{t\u03c9\u221dan}bracketri}htfor inelastic hard spheres we take\nMaxwellian distributions de\ufb01ned at their corresponding\ntemperatures for f0andf. Some technical details on this\ncalculation are provided in the Appendix A.

Average Pre- to Post-Collisional Intruder\nVelocity Ratio\nWe now evaluate the average \u221dan}bracketle{tv1/v2\u221dan}bracketri}ht, wherev1andv2\nare the modulus of the pre- and post-collisional veloci-\nties of the intruder. Given that this calculation is quite\nintricate, we approximate this as\n/angbracketleftbiggv1\nv2/angbracketrightbigg\n\u2248\u00afv0(t)\n\u00afv0(t+\u03c40)(59)\nwhere\u03c40(t) = 1/\u03bd0(t) is the mean time between two suc-\ncessive collisions of the intruder with the gas particles,\nand \u00afv0(t) denotes the average speed modulus of the in-\ntruder at time t.\nToestimate \u00af v0(t), weconsiderthetime evolutionofthe\nintruder\u2019s temperature T0(t). From Eqs. (8) and (10) one\nrealizes that\n\u2202tlnT0=\u2212\u03b6(t). (60)\nBecause T0\u221d\u00afv2\n0, Eq. (60) implies\nd\u00afv0\ndt=\u22121\n2\u03b6(t)\u00afv0. (61)\nSo, if we integrate Eq. (61) between tandt+\u03c40, we get\n\u00afv0(t+\u03c40)\u2212\u00afv0(t) =\u2212/integraldisplayt+\u03c40\nt\u03b6(t\u2032)\n2\u00afv0(t\u2032)dt\u2032\n=\u2212\u03b6(t)\u03c40(t)\n4[\u00afv0(t+\u03c40)+ \u00afv0(t)].\n(62)\nIn the last expression, we (i) have assumed that the\ncooling rate \u03b6(t) does not change much during the mi-\ncroscopic time interval \u03c40and, so, it can be considered\nconstant in the integral, and (ii) we have approximated\nthe remaining integral using the trapezoidal rule. From\nEq. (62) we \ufb01nd\n\u00afv0(t)\n\u00afv0(t+\u03c40)=1+\u03b6\u03c40/4\n1\u2212\u03b6\u03c40/4. (63)\nSince\u03b6(t)\u221dT(t)1/2and\u03c40(t) =\u03bd0(t)\u22121\u221dT(t)\u22121/2, it\nturns out that \u03b6(t)\u03c40(t) =\u03b6(t)/\u03bd0(t) does not depend on\ntime. Thus, from Eq. (17) one achieves the expression\n\u03b6(t)\u03c40(t) =1\u2212\u03b12\nd\u03a5, (64)\nwhere use has been made of the result [25]\n\u03b6(t)\u03c4(t) =1\u2212\u03b12\nd. (65)\nInserting Eq. (64) into Eq. (63), and taking into account\nEq. (59), we \ufb01nd\n/angbracketleftbiggv1\nv2/angbracketrightbigg\n\u22484d\u03a5\u2212\u03b12+1\n4d\u03a5+\u03b12\u22121. (66)Finally, from Eqs (47), (57), and (66), we obtain the\nfollowing approximated expression for the perseverance\n\u2126:\n\u2126 =4d\u03a5+1\u2212\u03b12\n4d\u03a5\u22121+\u03b12/braceleftbigg\n1\u22121\n21+\u03b10\n1+m0/m/bracketleftBig\n1\u2212\u02dc\u03c9(\u03b2)/bracketrightBig/bracerightbigg\n.\n(67)\nThis equation, along with Eq. (48) [and then Eqs. (49)\nand (51)], is likely the main result of the present work.\nVI. DEPENDENCE OF /an}bracketle{tr1\u00b7rk/an}bracketri}htONkAND MSD\nIN UNITS OF/angbracketleftbig\nr2/angbracketrightbig\n. COMPARISON WITH\nSIMULATIONS\nIn Sec. IV, we derived the key result (48), showing\nthat\u221dan}bracketle{tr1\u00b7rk\u221dan}bracketri}htis proportional to \u2126k\u22121. This makes the re-\nduced collisional series (32) a geometric series with ratio\n\u2126. From this, we got our main result: Eqs. (51) and (67)\nfor the MSD of the intruder. Now, we want to assess the\naccuracy of these theoretical predictions. In this section\nwe consider the di\ufb00usion of an intruder in a 3D granular\ngas. We will test the validity of Eqs. (48), (51), and our\nexpression for \u2126, Eq. (67), comparing them with DSMC\nresults.\nA. Dependence of /an}bracketle{tr1\u00b7rk/an}bracketri}htonk\nFrom the de\ufb01nitions of ckin Eq. (33), we see that\nstudying the k-dependence of \u221dan}bracketle{tr1\u00b7rk\u221dan}bracketri}htis equivalent to\nstudying the k-dependence of ck. Equation (48) implies\nck+1\nck\u2248\u2126,\u2200k (68a)\ni.e.,ck+1/ck\u2248\u2126 for all k. To validate these relations,\nwe will compare the theoretical expression of \u2126 [given\nby Eq. (67)] with the numerical values of ck+1/ckob-\ntained by means of the DSMC method [24] for inelastic\nhard spheres (implementation details of this method are\nprovided in the Appendix B).\nGiven that the parameter space of our system (con-\nstituted by the parameters \u03b10,\u03b1,m0/m,\u03c30/\u03c3, and the\nreduced density n\u03c33) is quite large, a full comparison be-\ntween theory and simulations exceeds the scope of this\narticle. For this reason, we will compare results for a\nlimited set of representative cases. Additionally, we con-\nsider the low-density regime ( n\u03c33\u21920), and hence the\npair correlation functions are \u03c7=\u03c70= 1.\nIn Table I, simulation results are presented for the ini-\ntial four values of ck+1/ckfor 24 cases with di\ufb00erent\nmasses, sizes, and normal restitution coe\ufb03cients. The\nagreement between simulation and theory is excellent:\nsimulated values for k= 1, 2, 3, and 4 closely match the\ntheoreticalvaluesof\u2126obtainedfromEq.(67); di\ufb00erences\narerarelyaboveacoupleofhundredthsandusuallymuch\nsmaller. This is especially true for c2/c1, where the dif-\nference from the theoretical \u2126 is always less than one\n\n10\n/s48/s46/s52 /s48/s46/s53 /s48/s46/s54 /s48/s46/s55 /s48/s46/s56 /s48/s46/s57 /s49/s46/s48/s48/s46/s48/s48/s46/s50/s48/s46/s52/s48/s46/s54/s48/s46/s56/s49/s46/s48\n/s32/s97/s99/s107/s43/s49/s47/s99/s107/s32/s32\nFIG. 1.

Here, and in the\nrest of the \ufb01gures, the absence of error bars indicates that t he\nstandard error is smaller than the size of the symbols. Due to\nlarge statistical errors, especially at \u03b1= 0.9 and 1, we have\nnot included simulation data for c5/c4whenm0/m= 1/8.\nThe error bars shown for m0/m= 1/8 correspond to the\nuncertainty in c4/c3. The solid lines represent \u2126 de\ufb01ned by\nEq. (67).\nhundredth. This is of signi\ufb01cant relevance given that the\n\ufb01rst two terms in the reduced collisional series are the\nmost important (especially as \u2126 decreases).\nFigure 1 further compares simulated ck+1/ckvalues\nfork= 1, 2, 3, and 4 with the theoretical values of \u2126\nfor additional cases. The \ufb01gure shows that the agree-\nment between simulation and \u2126 worsens as kincreases,\nthough this e\ufb00ect diminishes with increasingthe mass ra-\ntiom0/m. Form0/m\u22652, simulation symbols for di\ufb00er-\nentkvalues are barely distinguishable. For a given value\nofk,ck+1/ckincreases with m0/m, indicating that the\ncorrelation between the initial displacement r1and the\nk-th displacement rkdecreases more slowly when m0/m\ngets bigger. This makes sense: if the intruder is much\nheavier than the granular gas particles, collisions will\nhardly perturb the intruder\u2019s trajectory, so the direction\nafterkcollisions (if kis not too large) will remain close\nto the initial r1. This e\ufb00ect becomes strongeras the colli-\nsions become more inelastic (as \u03b10=\u03b1becomes smaller)\nbecause the normal component of the relative velocity\nalong the line of separation between the centers of the\ncolliding sphere decreases. In other words, inelastic par-\nticles bounce less than elastic ones, so they tend to keep\ngoing in the same direction as before the collision (this\ne\ufb00ect can be seen in the animations of Ref. [36]).\nIn Fig. 2, we also compare simulated ck+1/ckvalues\nfork= 1, 2, 3, and 4 with the theoretical \u2126 for three\nmass ratios ( m0/m= 6, 2, and 1), and three size ratios/s48/s46/s52 /s48/s46/s53 /s48/s46/s54 /s48/s46/s55 /s48/s46/s56 /s48/s46/s57 /s49/s46/s48/s48/s46/s52/s48/s46/s53/s48/s46/s54/s48/s46/s55/s48/s46/s56/s48/s46/s57/s49/s46/s48\n/s32/s97/s99/s107/s43/s49/s47/s99/s107/s32/s32\nFIG. 2.

The solid lines rep-\nresent \u2126 de\ufb01ned by Eq. (67).\n(\u03c30/\u03c3= 1/2, 1, and 2). Here, the simulation values ob-\ntained from the DSMC method again agree well with the\ntheoretical prediction for \u2126. We see that for given values\nof the mass ratio m0/mand the (common) coe\ufb03cient of\nrestitution ( \u03b1=\u03b10), \u2126\u223c \u221dan}bracketle{tr1\u00b7r1+k\u221dan}bracketri}ht1/kincreases when\n\u03c30/\u03c3decreases, meaning collision correlation decreases\nmore slowly when \u03c30/\u03c3is smaller. This, along with the\nm0/mdependence we \ufb01nd in Fig. 2, shows that colli-\nsion correlations decrease more slowly (\u2126 is larger) when\nm0/mis higher, \u03c30/\u03c3is lower, and collisions are more\ninelastic.\nFigures 1 and 2 show that the dependence of ck+1/ck\non the coe\ufb03cients of restitution is approximately linear,\nprovided m0/mis not too large and \u03c30/\u03c3is not too\nsmall. We also notice that curves for di\ufb00erent m0/m\nvalues but the same \u03c30/\u03c3are roughly parallel. However,\nwhenm0/mis large and \u03c30/\u03c3is small, the lines curve\nand tend to run parallel to the line ck+1/ck= 1. This\nnonlinearbehaviorisevidentinthecase m0/m= 6,espe-\ncially when \u03c30/\u03c3= 1/2. This case also shows that when\n\u03b10/lessorsimilar0.55, the simulated ck+1/ckvalues are so close to\n1 that \u2126 becomes unphysical, exceeding 1. This leads to\nunphysical (negative) MSD values according to Eq. (51).\nHowever, Eq. (51) correctly predicts a very large MSD\nwhenck+1/ckvalues are close to 1, due to slow conver-\ngence of the reduced collisional series. This makes sense\nphysically, as an intruder with \u2126 \u22481 acts like a quasi-\nballistic particle for many collisions. Remember [from\nEq. (54)] that the persistence collisions (the maximum\nnumber of collisions for which the trajectory can be con-\nsidered ballistic) are given by \u02dc n=\u22121/ln\u2126.\nFinally, Fig.3shows ck+1/ckversus\u03b10fora\ufb01xedvalue\nof\u03b1(\u03b1= 0.7) and several values of the mass m0/mand\ndiameter \u03c30/\u03c3ratios.

COMPARISON WITH THE BOLTZMANN\nTHEORETICAL RESULTS\nIt is natural wonder if the theoretical results derived\nin this paper for the MSD of an intruder immersed in\na granular gas in HCS [Eqs. (52) and (67)] are compa-\nrable, worse, or better than those previously obtained\nin the granular literature by solving the inelastic ver-\nsion of the Boltzmann kinetic equation by means of the\nChapman\u2013Enskogmethod [9]. Asusual in kinetic theory,\ngiven that the (time-dependent) tracer di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03-\ncientD(t) =/angbracketleftbig\nR2/angbracketrightbig\n/2dtis given in terms of the solutionof a linear integral equation, an explicit expression of\nD(t) is obtained by considering the \ufb01rst few terms in a\nSonine polynomial expansion. If only the leading term in\nthe series expansion is considered, the corresponding ex-\npression of D(t) is referred to as the \ufb01rst-Sonine approx-\nimation. If one considers two terms in the series expan-\nsion, one gets the second-Sonine approximation to the\ndi\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient. Both Sonine approximations were\nobtained in Ref. [22] for low-density three-dimensional\ngranular gases and in Ref. [23] for d-dimensional granu-\nlar gases at moderate densities.\nThe relationship between the di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient D(t)\nand the e\ufb00ective free path \u21132\ne=/angbracketleftbig\nR2/angbracketrightbig\n/\u221dan}bracketle{tN\u221dan}bracketri}htis [25]\n\u21132\ne= 2d/tildewideD\u03a5\u03b2\u21132\n0,M=2d/tildewideD\n\u03a5\u21132\nM, (69)\nwhere/tildewideDis the dimensionless di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient de\ufb01ned\nby\nD(t) = 2/bracketleftBigg\n\u0393/parenleftbigd+1\n2/parenrightbig\n\u0393/parenleftbigd\n2/parenrightbig/bracketrightBigg2\nT(t)\nm\u03bd(t)/tildewideD.

Furthermore, note that Eq. (26)\nhas been used to get the rightmost equation. The \ufb01rst-\nand second-Sonine approximations of the coe\ufb03cient /tildewideD\naregiven in the Appendix B for the sakeof completeness.\nThe Maxwell mean free paths may not be the same as\nthe meanfreepaths \u21130and\u2113, whicharede\ufb01ned bytheav-\nerage distances traveled by a particle between collisions.\nHowever, for elastic hard spheres, \u21130=\u21130,Mand\u2113=\u2113M\n[28]. Simulations con\ufb01rm these relations also hold for in-\nelastic hard spheres. Therefore, we will use \u21130and\u2113to\ndenote\u21130,Mand\u2113M, respectively, from now on. Thus,\nin terms of the dimensionless di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient /tildewideD, the\ne\ufb00ective free path \u2113eis [25]\n\u21132\ne= 2d/tildewideD\u03a5\u03b2\u21132\n0=2d/tildewideD\n\u03a5\u21132, (71)\nwhere the explicit dependence of /tildewideDon the parameter\nspace of the system depends on the speci\ufb01c Sonine ap-\nproximation considered.

For elastic collisions, both the\nfree path distribution rand the ratio \u03bacan be expressed\nas integrals that can be easily evaluated numerically [8].\nAdditionally, asymptotics expressions for the free path\ndistribution in certain limits are known. In the case\nof elastic collisions, \u03badepends solely on the mass ratio\nm0/mand takes values close to 1 (see Fig. 2 of Ref. [8]).\nFor instance, \u03ba\u22431.0506 for m0/m= 1. However, for\ngranular gases in HCS, no expressions for the free path\ndistribution and \u03baare known. Therefore, to o\ufb00er a clean\ncomparison between the kinetic theory and the random\nwalk results derived here, we resort to estimate \u03bafrom\nour numerical simulations.\nFigures 6 and 7 compare simulation results for \u2113e(nor-\nmalized by the mean free path \u21130) with those obtained\nfrom the theoretical results obtained from both (i) the\n\ufb01rst-andsecond-Sonineapproximations,and(ii)the ran-\ndom walk approximation. Figure 6 shows results for\nthree di\ufb00erent mass ratios (intruder mass greater than,\nequal to, and less than the mass of the granular gas par-\nticles) and a common diameter for intruder and gas par-\nticles (\u03c30=\u03c3). We observe that the results from all\nthree approximations are quite good. While the \ufb01rst-\nSonine approximation clearly gives the worst results, the\npredictions of the second-Sonine approximation and our\nrandom walk approximation are very similar and com-\npare quite well with simulations. Figure 7 shows the\ne\ufb00ect of changing the intruder size (intruder diameter\nless than, equal to, and greater than the gas grain di-\nameter) while keeping the mass ratio \ufb01xed ( m0/m=1).\nHere, the agreement of all three approximations with the\nsimulation results is very reasonable, except notably for/s48/s46/s52 /s48/s46/s53 /s48/s46/s54 /s48/s46/s55 /s48/s46/s56 /s48/s46/s57 /s49/s46/s48/s50/s46/s48/s50/s46/s50/s50/s46/s52/s50/s46/s54/s50/s46/s56\n/s97\n/s32/s108\n/s101/s47 /s108\n/s48\n/s32\nFIG. 7.

CONCLUSIONS\nThis article addresseshow far an intruder in a granular\ngas (modeled as a gas of inelastic hard spheres) moves\nwhen subjected only to collisions with particles of the\ngranulargas, as the system freely evolvesand cools (cool-\ning due to the inelastic collisions). It is known [11, 22]\nthat the answer to this question can be obtained by solv-\ning the (inelastic) Boltzmann kinetic equation with the\nChapman-Enskog method. Here, we revisit the problem\nbut employing a method that can be considered even\nmoreclassic(older)thantheChapman-Enskogapproach,\nas it originates from the random walk method utilized by\nSmoluchowski in his analysis of Brownian motion (Sec-\ntion 11 of Ref. [2]).\nThe method followed in this paper is based on noticing\nthat the seriesforthe MSDofa particleafter Ncollisions\n\n14\n(N\u226b1),\n/angbracketleftbig\nR2/angbracketrightbig\n=N/parenleftbig/angbracketleftbig\nr2/angbracketrightbig\n+2\u221dan}bracketle{tr1\u00b7r2\u221dan}bracketri}ht+2\u221dan}bracketle{tr1\u00b7r3\u221dan}bracketri}ht+.../parenrightbig\n(74)\napproximates a geometric series with roughly constant\nratios between terms. Approximating these ratios by \u2126,\nwe obtain the result\n/angbracketleftbig\nR2/angbracketrightbig\n=N/angbracketleftbig\nr2/angbracketrightbig\n(1+\u2126+\u21262+...) =N/angbracketleftbig\nr2/angbracketrightbig\n1\u2212\u2126.(75)\nAn explicit expression of \u2126 [see Eq. (67)] for a granular\ngas of three-dimensional hard spheres has been obtained\nin this paper. This expression reduces to the so-called\nmean persistence ratio when the collisions are elastic [9].\nTo gauge the reliability of this theoretical result, a com-\nparison with the numerical results obtained here from\nthe DSMC method [24] for a granular gas in the HCS\nhas been carried out. For a wide range of masses, sizes,\nand coe\ufb03cients of restitution, the ratio of the successive\nterms appearing in Eq. (74) is well approximated (see\nTable I and Figs. 1, 2, and 3) by our expression (67) for\n\u2126. This good agreement validates the accuracy of Eq.\n(75), as shown in Figures 4 and 5. The agreement is\nsurprisingly good.\nFinally, we have compared our expression for the MSD\nwith the \ufb01rst- and second-Sonine approximations de-\nrived from the Chapman-Enskog solution of the Boltz-\nmann equation. The comparison is not straightforward\nas our MSD expression is formulated in terms of/angbracketleftbig\nr2/angbracketrightbig\n,\nwhile both Sonine approximationsare expressed in terms\nof\u221dan}bracketle{tr\u221dan}bracketri}ht, and the precise relationship between these two\nquantities is unknown. To enable the comparison, we\nhave used the empirical relationship between/angbracketleftbig\nr2/angbracketrightbig\nand\n\u221dan}bracketle{tr\u221dan}bracketri}htobtained from simulations. We found that our MSD\nexpression generally provides signi\ufb01cantly better agree-\nment with simulations than the \ufb01rst-Sonine approxima-\ntion. We found that in general our expression for the\nMSD comparessigni\ufb01cantly better with simulationsthan\nthe \ufb01rst-Sonine approximation. Moreover,its accuracy is\ncomparable to that of the second-Sonine approximation,\nwhichrequiresthecomputationofmorecollisionintegrals\nthan our random walk approach.\nSeveral extensions of this work are worth exploring.\nOne obvious extension is to apply our method to hard\ndisks to see how much the dimension of the medium af-\nfects its accuracy. Our considerations have been very\ngeneral, so extending them to other dimensions should\nbe feasible. Speci\ufb01cally, we expect that the mathemat-\nical steps used here to determine the mean persistence\nratio\u221dan}bracketle{t\u03c9\u221dan}bracketri}htin 3D will be quite similar to those required for\n2D. Furthermore, we havefocused on dilute systems with\npair correlations at contact being 1. We could also ex-\nplorehowtheresultschangewhengranulargasesatmod-\nerate densities are considered. This article have focused\non the analysis of the MSD in the long-time regime. An\nall-time analysis extending beyond the scaling discussion\nof Sec. IVC would also be of interest. Also, extending\nour analysis to the di\ufb00usion of an intruder within a gran-\nular gasmixture presents an interesting avenuefor futureresearch. We could also investigate how well our method\nwould describe granular gases with non-hard-core inter-\nactions (for instance, by considering the so-called inelas-\ntic Maxwell models [11]), or even how the inclusion of ro-\ntational degrees of freedom in collisions (inelastic rough\nhard spheres) would a\ufb00ect the results. We intend to ex-\nplore these avenues in the future.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge \ufb01nancial support from\nGrant PID2020-112936GB-I00 funded by\nMCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033.

The\ncalculation follows similar steps as those made for molec-\nular gases in the Chapman and Cowling textbook (see\nchapter 5, sec. 5.5 of Ref. [9]).\nLet us consider an intruder of mass m0and diameter\n\u03c30moving in a granular gas of mass mand diameter \u03c3.\nLet us denote by v2andv1the post- and pre-collisional\nvelocities of the intruder in an intruder-grain collision.\nThe relationship between v2andv1is [11]\nv2=v1\u2212\u00b5(1+\u03b10)(/hatwide\u03c3\u00b7g)/hatwide\u03c3, (A1)\nwhere we recall that \u00b5=m/(m+m0) and\u03b10is the coef-\n\ufb01cient of normal restitution for intruder-grain collisions.\nMoreover, g=v1\u2212vis the relative velocity of the col-\nliding pair ( vis the velocity of the granular gas particle)\nand/hatwide\u03c3is the unit vector along the line joining the centers\nof the spheres that represent the intruder and the grain\nat contact. Let \u221dan}bracketle{tv2(v1)\u221dan}bracketri}htdenote the average (or mean)\nvelocity after collision of the intruder, given that its ve-\nlocity before the collision was v1. Taking the average\nover collisions with particles of the granular gas, one has\nthe result\n\u221dan}bracketle{tv2(v1)\u221dan}bracketri}ht=\u03c3d\u22121\nP0\u03c70/integraldisplay\ndv/integraldisplay\nd/hatwide\u03c3\u0398(/hatwide\u03c3\u00b7g)(/hatwide\u03c3\u00b7g)v2f(v),\n(A2)\nwhere\u03c3= (\u03c3+\u03c30)/2,f(v) is the one-particle velocity\ndistribution of the granular gas and\nP0=\u03c3d\u22121\u03c70/integraldisplay\ndv/integraldisplay\nd/hatwide\u03c3\u0398(/hatwide\u03c3\u00b7g)(/hatwide\u03c3\u00b7g)f(v)\n=B1\u03c3d\u22121\u03c70/integraldisplay\ndvg f(v).

In this case, to\nevaluate the integral appearing in Eq. (A7), we express\nvin terms of spherical coordinates v,\u03b8, and\u03d5aboutv1\nas axis.

To perform the angular integral in Eq.\n(A9), one has take into account the identity\ng=/radicalBig\nv2sin2\u03b8cos2\u03d5+v2sin2\u03b8sin2\u03d5+(v1\u2212vcos\u03b8)2=v/radicalbigg\nsin2\u03b8+/parenleftBigv1\nv\u2212cos\u03b8/parenrightBig2\n.

(A20)\nThus,\u221dan}bracketle{t\u03c9\u221dan}bracketri}htcan be written as\n\u221dan}bracketle{t\u03c9\u221dan}bracketri}ht= 1\u22121\n2\u00b5(1+\u03b10)+1\n2\u221a\u03c0\u03c32\u03c70\u00b5(1+\u03b10)\nN0nn0vth\u03b23/2/bracketleftBigg/integraldisplay1\n0d\u03b7\u03b74/parenleftbig\n\u03b72\u22125/parenrightbig\n(\u03b72+\u03b2)7/2+/integraldisplay\u221e\n1d\u03b7\u03b7/parenleftbig\n1\u22125\u03b72/parenrightbig\n(\u03b72+\u03b2)7/2/bracketrightBigg\n.(A21)\nThe \ufb01nal expression of the mean-persistence ratio can be achieve d when one evaluates the integrals and inserts Eq.\n(A18) into Eq. (A21). The result is\n\u221dan}bracketle{t\u03c9\u221dan}bracketri}ht= 1\u22121\n2\u00b5(1+\u03b10)+1\n4\u00b5(1+\u03b10)\u03b23/2/parenleftbigg\u03b2\n1+\u03b2/parenrightbigg1/2\u03b2\u221a1+\u03b2sinh\u22121/parenleftbig\n\u03b2\u22121/2/parenrightbig\n\u22121\u2212\u03b2\n\u03b2\u221a1+\u03b2. (A22)\nIt is straightforward to see that Eq. (57) is equivalent to\nexpression (A22). For elastic collisions ( \u03b1=\u03b10= 1),\n\u03b2=m0/mand Eq. (A22) [or its equivalent Eq. (57)]yields\n\u221dan}bracketle{t\u03c9\u221dan}bracketri}ht=1\n2\u00b5+1\n2\u00b52\n0\u00b5\u22121/2ln/parenleftBigg\n1+\u00b51/2\n\u00b51/2\n0/parenrightBigg\n,(A23)\nwhere\u00b50=m0/(m+m0). Equation (A23) agrees with\nthe result (5.51,1) obtained in the Chapman\u2013Cowling\n\n17\ntextbook [9] for molecular gases. In particular, when\nm0=m, Eq. (A23) yields the simple result \u221dan}bracketle{t\u03c9\u221dan}bracketri}ht \u2243\n0.405806. When the intruder and granular gas parti-\ncles are mechanically equivalent ( m0/m=\u03c30/\u03c3= 1 but\n\u03b1=\u03b10\u221dne}ationslash= 1),\u03b2= 1 and Eq. (A22) leads to\n\u221dan}bracketle{t\u03c9\u221dan}bracketri}ht=3\u2212\u03b1\n4+1+\u03b1\n16/parenleftBig\u221a\n2sinh\u22121(1)\u22122/parenrightBig\n\u22431\u22120.2971(1+ \u03b1).

[8] for a molecular gas in equilibrium. In the\nHCS, however, grains and intruders lose energy due to\nthe inelasticity of collisions. Therefore, it is necessary to\naccount for this energy loss in the velocity changes after\ncollisions and in the decay of temperature. However, if\nthe granular mixture (in our case, tracers and granular\ngas) is excited by the Gaussian thermostat\nFi=\u22121\n2miv\u03b6i (B1)\nwhich exactly compensates for the collisional energy loss,\nthe measured quantities remain the same as for the HCS,\nand the temperature achieve a stationary value which\nmakes de DSMC implementation simpler. Apart from\nthis, step 4 detailed in Ref. [8] must be slightly modi-\n\ufb01ed to incorporate the restitution coe\ufb03cient. Hence, if\nthe collision is accepted, the velocities of particles are\nupdated according to the scattering rules [11]:\nvk\u2192vk\u2212(1+\u03b1ij)\u00b5ji(gk\u2113\u00b7/hatwide\u03c3k\u2113)/hatwide\u03c3k\u2113,\nv\u2113\u2192v\u2113+(1+\u03b1ij)\u00b5ij(gk\u2113\u00b7/hatwide\u03c3k\u2113)/hatwide\u03c3k\u2113,(B2)\nbeing\u00b5ij=mi/(mi+mj),/hatwide\u03c3k\u2113a random colliding direc-\ntion for a pair of colliding particles labeled as kand\u2113,\nandgk\u2113=vk\u2212v\u2113.

87\n1. Introduction\n1.1. What are Dynamical Coupled-Channel approaches?\nScattering processes, including production reactions in which final states re-scatter, represent one of the few avenues to\nexperimentally access the properties of the sub-atomic world. Together with the study of decay processes they allow to\nstudy strong interactions, or the response of strongly interacting systems to electroweak probes. Often, the desired output\nextracted from scattering consists in partial-wave projected amplitudes and the hadronic resonance spectrum contained\ntherein, that allow for comparison with theory and models. This includes quark models, unitarized chiral approaches,\n2\n\nDyson-Schwinger, and other functional methods. Some theory approaches, including modern Lattice QCD-based hadron\nspectroscopy efforts (for reviews see [1\u20136]), allow in some cases to directly compare to amplitudes, while other models\nmight only predict the spectrum of hadronic resonances, but not their widths or branching ratios.\nAmplitude analyses aim to reconstruct scattering and production amplitudes, resonances, and their properties from\nexperimental data to allow for such comparisons. S-matrix principles, unitarity and analyticity, help constrain this\nendeavor, which often requires the parametrization of the amplitude in kinematic variables like energy, sub-energies, and\nscattering angles. Dynamical coupled-channel (DCC) approaches are a class of amplitude parametrizations formulated\nin terms of mesons and baryons as degrees of freedom that are stable under strong interactions (see Sect. 2 for the\nformalism). The \u201ccoupled-channel\u201d aspect refers to the fact that strongly interacting systems can transform back and\nforth to different states as allowed by conserved quantum numbers. Conversely, the coupled-channel framework enables\none to synthesize independent sources of information of a strongly interacting system manifested in its different decay\nchannels and excitation mechanisms.\nThe \u201cdynamical\u201d part of DCC approaches is less well defined. Historically it is attributed to the explicit meson and\nbaryonexchangesintheincludedinteractionsinallthreeMandelstamvariables s,t, and u, orotherkinematicvariablesfor\nreactions involving more than two-body systems. This is to be seen in contrast to modern approaches guided by the idea\nof scale separation [7] in which, at a given order, some particle exchange processes could be explicitly included while others\nare simply absorbed into contact terms. Although the explicit modeling of strong interactions through exchange processes\nundoubtedly forms an aspect of DCC approaches, the use of contact terms is common practice, as well. Explicit particle\nexchange is also a necessity in terms of unitarity once three-body channels are considered as discussed in Sect. 2.7.1. In\nthat sense, the dynamical exchange of mesons and baryons is less a model ingredient and more a requirement of S-matrix\nproperties.\nA technical aspect of \u201cdynamical\u201d concerns the relativistic scattering equation of DCC approaches that always involves\nat least one explicit momentum integration, rendering it a genuine integral equation. For two-body systems one can\nrestrict the driving interaction to on-shell kinematics, simplifying the integral equation to an algebraic \u201cK-matrix\u201d(-like)\nexpression. After all, only on-shell quantities are accessible experimentally and off-shell extensions are ambiguous, as\ndiscussed in Sect. 2.10. However, for three-body channels the integration over a \u201cspectator\u201d momentum is always required\neven if the two-body sub-channels can still be expressed in terms of the on-shell amplitudes, see Sects. 2 and 2.7.1 for a\ndiscussion. In that case one is stuck with an integral equation.\nIndeed, manyDCCapproacheswereformulatedforsystemsincludingthree-bodystatesbecausetheDCCparametriza-\ntion allows to relatively easily incorporate coupled-channel two- and three-body unitarity, at least in principle. The prime\nexample is the pion-nucleon ( \u03c0N) sector with the ubiquitous \u03c0\u03c0Nchannel into which all excited baryon resonances except\nfor the \u2206(1232)decay1. The three-body aspect of DCC approaches is discussed in depth in Sects. 2.7.1 and 4.\nSometimes, the only aspect kept from DCC approaches for three-body physics is the unitarity structure and the\npertinent particle exchange processes, while the two-body sub-amplitudes, referred to as \u201cisobars\u201d, can be provided in\nany parametrization respecting two-body unitarity. In such cases, no attempts are made to understand interactions in\nterms of microscopic exchange processes (except for processes required by unitarity). Instead, DCC approaches serve for\na relatively clean amplitude parametrization to analyze large data sets for the purpose of determining the spectrum of\nexcited states and their properties.\nIndeed, since DCC approaches have a substantial theoretical underpinning, they are often used to analyze meson-\nbaryon scattering (Sect. 3.2), real-photon induced reactions (Sect. 3.3), virtual-photon induced reactions (Sect. 3.4),\nneutrino-induced reactions (Sect. 3.5), multi-meson production reactions (Sect. 4), and lattice QCD data (Sect. 2.11).\nThere are also baryon-baryon systems where coupled-channel aspects play an important role, for example for the \u039bN-\u03a3N\ninteraction (Sect. 5). And coupled-channel dynamics is one of the starting points for interpreting and explaining the\nvarious structures observed in the heavy sector, i.e., in systems that involve charmed and bottom hadrons, the XYZ\nstates and pentaquarks (Sect. 6).\nWhile DCC approaches are extensively applied for data analysis and respect S-matrix principles, their origin lies in\nthe field-theoretical description of particle interactions. In their original formulation, an effective Lagrangian using meson\nand baryon degrees of freedom is expanded to provide the vertices for exchange processes that are then re-summed. We\nstart this discussion in Sect. 2.2 that is focused on the ANL-Osaka formulation and subsequently compare it to the Juelich\nmodel formulation in Sect. 2.3. These two approaches are highlighted throughout this review, but there are many more\napproaches pursued in the last decades as summarized in Sect. 1.2.\nFinally, we note that despite the advantages mentioned above DCC approaches require substantial formal and com-\nputational resources to unite aspects of field theory with a plethora of coupled channels and different excitations of the\nstrongly interacting system by hadrons and/or electroweakly interacting particles. Such models are then used to analyze\ntens of thousands of data of different final states. Therefore, DCC approaches tend to be refined over many years meaning\nthat there is also a historical aspect to this class of approaches discussed in the next subsection. Statistical aspects are\ndiscussed in Sect. 2.10.2 and extensions to finite-volume physics relevant for lattice QCD in Sect. 2.11.\n1The PDG notation includes the spin-parity assignment JPin resonance names that we often omit for better readability.\n3\n\nAs for notation, the total energy of the produced baryon-meson, meson-meson, or baryon-baryon systems is tradition-\nally named differently. Throughout this review, we use\nE=\u221as=W=z (1.1)\nexcept for Sect. 2.9.1 where zstands for an uniformization variable. The notation Erefers to the energy in the context of\nquantummechanics,\u221asistheMandelstaminvariant, Wistraditionallyusedinbaryonspectroscopyforthecenter-of-mass\n(c.m.) energy, and zis sometimes used when the range of the energy is extended to complex values.\n1.2. Brief overview of DCC approaches for the light baryon sector\nThe concept of coupled channels has a rich history and broad scope of applications [8, 9]. While the term \u201cdynamical\ncoupled channel approaches\u201d was coined in Refs. [10, 11], earliest examples for DCC approaches in the literature are\nstudies of the \u00afKNinteraction [12\u201316]. In those works the coupling to the \u03c0\u03a3and (in some cases) also to \u03c0\u039bchannels\nwere included. Note, however, that initially separable potentials were used. Only in later works [15, 16] the dynamics is\nbased on the meson-exchange picture. In Ref. [15] separable potentials as well as meson exchange are considered.\nRegarding the \u03c0Nsystem an early example for a study in the spirit of the DCC approach is an off-shell isobar model\nfrom 1985 that includes the coupling to \u03b7Nand to effective two-body channels representing \u03c0\u03c0N[17]. See also the\ndynamical model including pion photoproduction of Ref. [18]. The Dubna-Mainz-Taipei (DMT) model also builds on\na long history [19\u201321]. It was extended to include the \u03b7Nchannel besides the \u03c0Nchannel, plus imaginary parts for\nresonance propagators modeling decay into other channels [22]. The analysis was extended up to F-waves and a center-\nof-mass (c.m.) energy of\u221as\u22482 GeV. The DMT partial waves were analytically continued to complex scattering energies\nto extract resonance poles and residues [23]. In the same paper, this direct determination of resonance singularities\nwas compared to approximate methods relying on information on the real-energy axis, like speed plots [24] and the\nregularization method [25].\nWhile the relativistic \u03c0Nmodel of Gross and Surya is restricted to the elastic \u03c0Nchannel [26], its treatment of unita-\nrized dynamics retaining the Dirac structure of the amplitude allows for the gauge invariant coupling of the photon [27].\nOne of the surprising findings of Ref. [26] is that setting the pion on its mass shell and iterating the nucleon exchange\nonce produces a good approximation of the box and crossed box Feynman diagrams. This is taken as motivation for\nthe three-dimensional reduction of the four-dimensional Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) using a prescription of Pearce\nand Jennings [28]. In the latter work, different reduction schemes are compared. See also Ref. [21] for a systematic\ninvestigation of different reduction schemes. Similarly, the covariant \u03c0Nmodel of Pascalutsa and Tjon [29] is based on\nthe solution of a dimensionally reduced (quasipotential) Bethe-Salpeter equation, later expanded to electroproduction\nreactions [30]. A more thorough discussion on the different schemes for the three-dimensional reduction of the BSE,\nleading to scattering equations like the ones by Blankenbecler-Sugar [31], Kadyshevsky [32], or Thomson [33] that are\ncommonly used in studies of meson-baryon and/or baryon-baryon interactions, can be found in Refs. [34\u201336].\nSolving the full, four-dimensional BSE is necessary to avoid dependence on reduction schemes or when including the\n\u03c0Namplitude in a bigger setting of, e.g., photoproduction amplitude while maintaining unitarity and gauge invariance\nat the same time [37\u201343] although gauge invariance can be reconstructed [44]. So far, such four-dimensional BSE have\nbeen solved analytically when using only contact terms [38, 39] or with non-local terms using Wick rotation [45]. In both\napproaches, the complexity of overlapping singularities due to u-channel baryon exchange has been circumvented for the\nprice of giving up exact three-body dynamics. In Sect. 2.7.1 we discuss one reduction scheme of the BSE in more detail\nfor illustration.\nStarting point of the Juelich-Bonn coupled-channel meson-baryon interaction is the simple \u03c0Npotential by Sch\u00fctz et\nal.[46,47]where, asthemainnewaspect, thephenomenological \u03c3-and \u03c1-exchangeswereeliminatedandthecorresponding\ncontributions in the scalar-isoscalar ( 0+) and vector-isovector ( 1\u2212) channels were fixed from a microscopic evaluation of\ncorrelated 2\u03c0-exchange. It was derived within relativistic time-ordered perturbation theory (TOPT), in close analogy to\nthe famous Bonn potential for nucleon-nucleon (NN) scattering [48]. The range of validity was up to plab\u2248500 MeV /c\n(\u221as\u22481.35 GeV). In the next step [49] the \u03b7Nchannel and effective \u03c0\u03c0Nchannels (in the form of \u03c3Nand\u03c0\u2206) were\nadded and the dynamical origin of the N(1535)andN(1440)resonances were investigated. Specifically, it was argued\nthat there are strong hints that the N\u2217(1535)is a genuine resonance in the sense of the quark model while the N(1440)\nis very likely dynamically generated. The energy range was still limited, reaching up to\u221as\u22481.4 GeVin general and\nup to\u221as\u22481.6 GeVfor specific partial waves like S11and the P11, in the common notation L2I2Jwith orbital angular\nmomentum L(S,P,D,. . .), isospin Iand total angular momentum J.\nIn the work of Krehl et al. [50, 51] some theoretical refinements were implemented and the dynamics of the N\u2217(1440)\n(Roper resonance) was examined thoroughly. In that model, besides two physical channels ( \u03c0N,\u03b7N), now three effective\nchannels were included ( \u03c3N,\u03c1N,\u03c0\u2206) in order to represent the physics of the \u03c0\u03c0Nchannels. Finally, in Ref. [52] further\nimprovements in the treatment of the dynamics were made. Specifically, a consistent description of the \u03c0Nphase shift in\ntheS11partial wave and of the \u03c0N\u2192\u03b7Ntransition cross section near the threshold was achieved. Later milestones in the\ndevelopment of the Juelich-Bonn model included the extension to channels with strangeness [53], photoproduction [54\u201357],\n4\n\nand inclusion of the \u03c9Nchannel [58]. The extension to electroproduction reactions [59\u201361] is referred to as Juelich-Bonn-\nWashington model (JBW). In this review, we often refer to all different sub-approaches as \u201cJBW\u201d for simplicity. Related\nformalisms were used to explore the nature of states with hidden charm [62\u201364].\nThe ANL-Osaka DCC model shares some but also differs in some construction principles from the JBW model. In the\nANL-Osaka model, a Hermitian effective Hamiltonian that is independent of the scattering energy is constructed from a\nfield theoretical model Lagrangian. Because of the energy-independent Hamiltonian, unitarity of the scattering amplitude\nis almost trivially satisfied within the Fock space in which one works.\nThe method to obtain the Hermitian Hamiltonian was first developed for nuclear potentials by Fukuda et al. [65],\nOkubo[66]andNishijima[67,68](FST-Okubo-Nishijima). Inthismethod, theFockspaceistruncatedtoonlynucleonsby\neliminating the meson degrees of freedom. This allows one not only to determine the Hamiltonian but also the electroweak\ncurrentsofthesystem. AconsistentapplicationofthemodelforallgeneratorsandcurrentsproducesapproximateLorentz\ninvariance of the form factors and currents conservation [69, 70]. This transformation method can be understood as a\nsystematic way of a three-dimensional reduction of the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude [71] similar to the Folded Diagram\nMethod [72]. However, the straightforward application of the FST-Okubo-Nishijima method gives singular non-static\ntwo-boson exchange potential in momentum space. In the ANL-Osaka model, a modified FST-Okubo-Nishijima method,\nthe \u201cunitary transformation method\u201d [73, 74], is utilized to construct a Hermitian Hamiltonian which describes the system\nbelow and above the meson production threshold.\nThe first application of the method was the analysis of single pion photoproduction and electroproduction around the\n\u2206resonance region [10, 75]. In addition to the magnetic transition form factor, electric and Coulomb quadrupole form\nfactors of N\u2206transition were predicted within the dynamical model. The cross sections were found to agree well with\nthe experimental data. The accumulated precise p(e, e\u2032\u03c0)Ndata was then re-analyzed and N\u2206transition form factors\nwere revised [76]. The coupled channel dynamics was studied extending the approach for the KY\u2295\u03c0NDCC model of\nthe\u03b3p\u2192KYreaction [77].\nTo investigate the meson production reactions beyond the \u2206(1232)energy region, the effective Hamiltonian and\nscattering equations for the two-body states \u03c0N, \u03b7N, \u03c0 \u2206, \u03c3N, \u03c1N and the three-body state \u03c0\u03c0Nwere formulated in\nRef. [11]. The DCC model for \u03c0Nscattering up to\u221as<2 GeVincluding S\u2212,P\u2212,D\u2212andF-waves was first studied in\nRef. [78] (JLMS model). Using the meson-induced reaction model, the helicity amplitudes of \u03b3N\u2192N\u2217were extracted\nfrom the analysis of the photoproduction (\u03b3, \u03c0)[79] data for\u221as<1.65GeV. Then, the Q2dependence of helicity\namplitudes for S11,P11andD13were obtained by analyzing electroproduction p(e, e\u2032\u03c0)N[80] data. The validity of the\nmodel for the inelastic processes was tested by the analyses of \u03c0N\u2192\u03b7N[81],\u03c0N\u2192\u03c0\u03c0N[82] and \u03b3N\u2192\u03c0\u03c0N[83]. The\nresults indicted a reasonable description of those processes, but suggested a need for the improvement in the higher energy\nregion. Meanwhile, the analytic structure of the scattering amplitude, the way to access the unphysical Riemann sheets,\nand the characterization of resonances through their pole positions and residues within the DCC model were studied in\nRefs. [84, 85], while poles of the P11resonances were examined in Ref. [86].\nLater, the JLMS model was extended to (1) include K\u039bandK\u03a3channels and to (2) perform a combined analysis\nof pion and photon-induced reactions on the proton [87] for\u221as<2 GeV, which is the basis of the current ANL-Osaka\nmodel. The pole positions, residues of the scattering amplitudes, and electromagnetic helicity amplitudes of \u03b3p\u2192N\u2217\nwere extracted in Ref. [87]. The helicity amplitude of \u03b3n\u2192N\u2217are provided in Ref. [88, 89] allowing one to separate\nthe iso-scalar and iso-vector helicity amplitudes. The elementary photoproduction reactions and meson-baryon scattering\namplitudes also served as input for the calculation of \u03b7photoproduction on the deuteron [90]. The DCC model was\nextended for the weak vector and axial vector currents for Q2<3(GeV/c)2[91, 92], which provides cross sections for\nneutrino physics. The Q2dependencies of the helicity amplitudes in the ANL-Osaka model were reported in Ref. [93].\nThe model was also extended to \u00afKNreactions for studying hyperon resonances [94, 95].\n2. Formalism of dynamical coupled-channel approaches\n2.1. Scattering equation\nMany approaches have been developed to extract the spectrum and properties of nucleon resonances from pion, photon\nand electron-induced meson production reactions. Dynamical coupled channel approaches provide a particularly suitable\nreaction framework to analyze the pertinent data. The scattering amplitudes of the meson production reactions are\nobtained by solving a three-dimensional relativistic Lippmann-Schwinger equation of two- and three-particle states with\nthe model interactions. The particles and their interactions are usually introduced via a model Lagrangian in relativistic\nquantum field theory. The form of the Lagrangian is constrained by the symmetries, such as Lorentz invariance, flavor\nand chiral symmetry, and their breaking where applicable. The two approaches discussed in the following reflect two\ndifferent approaches of how to cast this framework in a practical applications. In the implementations some differences\nexist between them.\n5\n\nApproach I: The Argonne-Osaka/ANL-Osaka assumes that in the \u2019medium\u2019 energy region only \u2019few-body\u2019 degrees\nof freedom are active and that they must be treated explicitly instead of solving the field theory which is an intrinsic\nmany body problem. The effects due to the many-body states are included as an effective interaction calculated\nperturbatively in coupling constants. The Fock-space of the model consists of \u201cbare\u201d resonances, two-body meson-\nbaryon, and \u03c0\u03c0Nthree-body states. The interactions among the particles are obtained by applying a unitary\ntransformation perturbatively on the field theoretical Hamiltonian. A feature of the approach is that the resulting\ninteractions do not depend on the scattering energy\u221asand the single nucleon state decouples from meson-baryon\nscattering state. The scattering equation of the meson-baryon systems are obtained by applying the projection\noperator technique.\nApproach II: Juelich-Bonn-Washington/JBW approach is based on relativistic time-ordered perturbation the-\nory (TOPT), with the effective interaction derived from the Wess-Zumino Lagrangian and from explicit Lagrangians\nfor excited baryons states. In this approach retardation effects from the exchange diagrams are retained and as\na consequence the interaction depends explicitly on the energy. The resulting pseudo-potential is iterated in a\nLippman-Schwinger type scattering equation, ensuring unitarity. There is also a renormalization program for the\nnucleon bound state. The approach shares many properties with the ANL-Osaka approach as a comparison of the\nscattering equations below shows [Eq. (2.21) vs. Eq. (2.57)].\n2.2. ANL-Osaka model\n2.2.1. Effective Hamiltonian and the method of unitary transformation\nTo illustrate the unitary transformation method, we consider the simplest phenomenological Hamiltonian of N, N\u2217and\n\u03c0,\nH=H0+HI. (2.1)\nHere, H0is free energy of particles. The interaction HIdescribes pion production or absorption B\u2194B\u2032+\u03c0, where\n(B, B\u2032)are(N, N),(N, N\u2217)or(N\u2217, N). In this section, both the excited baryons of isospin I=1/2(N\u2217) and I=3/2(\u2206)\nare represented by N\u2217while \u2206represents the \u2206(1232)3/2+resonance.\nThe essence of the unitary transformation method is to extract an effective Hamiltonian in a \"few-body\" space defined\nby a unitary operator U, such that the resulting scattering equations can be solved in practice,\nH\u2032=UHU\u2020. (2.2)\nIn the approach of Ref. [73], the first step is to decompose the interaction Hamiltonian HIinto two parts,\nHI=HP\nI+HQ\nI, (2.3)\nwhere HP\nIdefines the process which can take place in free space. In this model, HP\nIdescribes the process N\u2217\u2192N+\u03c0.\nHQ\nIdefines the virtual process, which cannot occur in free space because of energy-momentum conservation. HQ\nIincludes\nN\u2192N+\u03c0andN\u2192N\u2217+\u03c0. The virtual processes are eliminated by choosing an appropriate unitary transformation\nU. This can be done systematically by using a perturbative expansion of Uin powers of coupling constants. As a\nresult the effects of \u201cvirtual processes\u201d appear as effective interactions in the transformed Hamiltonian. Defining the\nfirst transformation U=exp(\u2212iS(1))by a Hermitian operator S(1)and expanding U=1\u2212iS(1)+..., the transformed\nHamiltonian can be written as\nH\u2032=UHU\u2020=H0+HP\nI+HQ\nI+[H0, iS(1)]+[HP\nI, iS(1)]+1\n2![[H0, iS(1)], iS(1)]+\u22ef. (2.4)\nThe virtual processes HQ\nIwhich are of first-order in the coupling constant are eliminated from Eq. (2.4) by imposing\nHQ\nI+[H0, iS(1)]=0. (2.5)\nSince H0is a diagonal operator in the Fock space, Eq. (2.5) clearly implies that iS(1)must have the same operator\nstructure as HQ\nIand is first order in the coupling constant. By using Eq. (2.5), Eq. (2.4) can be written as\nH\u2032=H0+HP\nI+[HP\nI, iS(1)]+1\n2[HQ\nI, iS(1)]+higher order terms . (2.6)\nIn this example, the effective Hamiltonian includes decay and production of N\u2217(the second term HP\nI) and s- and u-\nchannel baryon-exchange, non-resonant \u03c0B\u2212\u03c0B\u2032potentials (the third and the fourth terms). The backward propagation\nof hadrons, for example, pair production, is also included in HQ\nIand therefore taken into account as part of the effective\n6\n\nFigure 1: Basic mechanisms of the model Hamiltonian defined in Eq. (2.11).\npotential. It is informative to quote the matrix element of the \u03c0Npotential with s-channel nucleon exchange in this\napproach,\n\u27e8\u03c0(p\u2032)N(\u2212p\u2032)\u2223V\u2223\u03c0(p)N(\u2212p)\u27e9=\u0393(p\u2032)1\n2(1\nEN(p\u2032)+\u03c9\u03c0(p\u2032)\u2212MN+1\nEN(p)+\u03c9\u03c0(p)\u2212MN)\u0393(p), (2.7)\nwhere \u0393(p)is the \u03c0NNvertex, EN(p)=\u221a\np2+M2\nNand\u03c9\u03c0(p)=\u221a\np2+m2\u03c0. In TOPT, the corresponding matrix element\nof the driving term is given as\n\u27e8\u03c0(p\u2032)N(\u2212p\u2032)\u2223V\u2223\u03c0(p)N(\u2212p)\u27e9=\u0393(p\u2032)1\nE\u2212MN\u0393(p), (2.8)\nwhere Eis scattering energy. Eq. (2.7) and Eq. (2.8) coincide at the on-energy shell matrix element. Note that up to the\nsame order Eq. (2.4) should have an additional term which is the one-pion-loop contribution to the single nucleon state.\nSuch a mass renormalization term is dropped in practice, since it is part of the physical nucleon mass in the resulting\neffective Hamiltonian. The interaction MB\u2192\u03c0\u03c0Nis obtained by applying the next order unitary transformation\nU\u2032=exp(iS(2)).\nThe effective electromagnetic current or weak current which should be used together with the Hamiltonian H\u2032is\nobtained by applying the same transformation Uas\nJ\u00b5\neff=UJ\u00b5U\u2020. (2.9)\nHere J\u00b5represents electromagnetic current J\u00b5\nEMor weak charged/neutral current J\u00b5\nCC/J\u00b5\nNC. The effective current gives,\nfor example, J\u00b5\nem+N\u2192\u03c0NorJ\u00b5\nem+N\u2192N\u2217processes. They are used to describe meson photo-, electroproduction and\nneutrino reactions.\nIn summary, a feature of the method is that the effective Hamiltonian is hermitian and independent on the scattering\nenergy\u221as. As a result, the unitarity relation of the scattering amplitude is almost trivially satisfied. Another feature\nwhich is convenient for the phenomenological description is that the effective Hamiltonian is parametrized in terms of\nthe \u2019physical\u2019 nucleon. The single nucleon state is diagonalized in the effective Hamiltonian and has no coupling with the\n\u03c0BFock space. Analytic properties of the reaction amplitudes based on the ANL-Osaka model and the relation to the\nthree-dimensional reduction of the BSE and TOPT are discussed in Refs. [74, 96].\n2.2.2. Model Hamiltonian\nTowards a realistic model, the starting point is a set of Lagrangians describing the interactions between mesons ( M=\n\u03c0, \u03b7, \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c3, K ) and baryons ( B=N,\u039b,\u03a3,\u2206, N\u2217). We start from the Hamiltonian density Hof the meson-baryon system,\nwhich is derived by the standard quantization procedure from the model Lagrangian density L,\nH=\u2211\nj\u02d9\u03a6j\u03a0j\u2212L, (2.10)\nwhere \u03a0jis the conjugate momentum of \u03a6jgiven by \u03a0j=\u03b4L\n\u03b4\u02d9\u03a6j, and we set equal time commutation relation between the\nfield and its conjugate momentum.\nBy applying the unitary transformation method briefly explained in the previous section, we obtain the effective\nHamiltonian for the \u2019bare\u2019 excited baryon states P1=N\u2217, the meson-baryon states P2=\u03c0N, \u03b7N, \u03c0 \u2206, \u03c1N, \u03c3N, K \u039b, K\u03a3\nand the Q=\u03c0\u03c0Nstate. The Fock space of the model Hamiltonian consists of P+Qwith P=P1+P2.\nThe effective Hamiltonian of the model derived from the starting Lagrangian is given as [11, 87]\nHeff=H0+V . (2.11)\nH0is the free energy operator. For example, \u27e8\u03b1(p)\u2223H0\u2223\u03b1(p)\u27e9=\u221a\nm2\u03b1+p2=E\u03b1(p)for particle \u03b1with mass m\u03b1. The\ninteraction Hamiltonian is\nV=\u0393V+\u2211\nM\u2032B\u2032,MBvM\u2032B\u2032,MB+(\u2211\nMBv\u03c0\u03c0N,MB+(h.c.)).

(2.13)\nThe resonances associated with the bareexcited baryon states N\u2217and meson states M\u2217=\u03c1, \u03c3are induced by the\ninteractions \u0393N\u2217\u2192MBand\u0393M\u2217\u2192\u03c0\u03c0. These interactions are illustrated in Fig. 1 (a). The masses M0\nN\u2217andm0\nM\u2217of those\nbare states N\u2217andM\u2217are the parameters of the model which will be determined by fitting the \u03c0Nand\u03c0\u03c0scattering\ndata.\nThe non-resonant meson-baryon interactions vM\u2032B\u2032,MBandMB\u2192\u03c0\u03c0Ninteraction v\u03c0\u03c0N,MB are illustrated in\nFig. 1(b) and Fig. 1(c), respectively. All of these interactions are defined by the tree-diagrams generated from the\nconsidered Lagrangians. The mechanism of the meson-baryon interaction consist of the u- and s- channel baryon ex-\nchange, t-channel meson exchange and the contact interaction shown in Fig. 2. Here, as an example, the \u03c0Npotential\nv\u03c0N,\u03c0Nwith s-channel nucleon exchange is given:\n\u27e8\u03c0(k\u2032, i), N(p\u2032, s\u2032)\u2223v\u03c0N,\u03c0N\u2223\u03c0(k, j), N(p, s)\u27e9=1\n(2\u03c0)3\u221a\nMN\nEN(p\u2032)\u221a\nMN\nEN(p)1\u221a\n2\u03c9\u03c0(k\u2032)2\u03c9\u03c0(k)\n\u00d7(f\u03c0NN\nm\u03c0)2\n\u00afus\u2032(p\u2032)/k\u2032\u03b35\u03c4i1\n2\u23a1\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a31\n/k\u2032+/p\u2032+MN+1\n/k+/p+MN\u23a4\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6/k\u03b35\u03c4ju(p)s(2.14)\nwhere k\u00b5=(\u03c9\u03c0(k),k), p\u00b5=(EN(p),p). In Eq. (2.14), nucleon propagator is similar to the covariant propagator except\ntime component of the momentum. The u-channel nucleon exchange potential is expressed in a similar form. The explicit\nexpressions of all interactions in Eq. (2.12) can be found in Refs. [11, 87].\nThe non-resonant interaction v\u03c0\u03c0N,MBis calculated from Eq. (2.6). The mechanisms for v\u03c0\u03c0N,\u03c0Nare shown in Fig. 3\ntogether with the mechanisms of v\u03c0\u03c0N,\u03b3N.\n2.2.3. Scattering equation\nOur next task is to derive a set of dynamical coupled-channel equations for describing \u03c0N, J\u00b5N\u2192MB, \u03c0\u03c0N reactions\nwithin the model space N\u2217\u2295MB\u2295\u03c0\u03c0N.\nThe starting point is the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the T-matrix,\nT(E)=V+V1\nE\u2212H0+i\u03f5T(E), (2.15)\nwhere E=\u221asis the total energy. The interaction Vis defined from the effective Hamiltonian in Eq. (2.12). The unitarity\ncondition is given as\nT(E)\u2212T\u2020(E)=\u22122\u03c0iT\u2020(E)\u03b4(E\u2212H0)T(E). (2.16)\nThis relation is satisfied since our model interaction does not depend on the scattering energy E.Vdoes not have\ndiscontinuities.\n8\n\n\u03c0N\u2192\u03c0\u03c0N\n\u03b3N\u2192\u03c0\u03c0N\nFigure 3: The mechanisms for v\u03c0\u03c0N,\u03c0Nandv\u03c0\u03c0N,\u03b3N\nFigure 4: One-particle-exchange interactions Z\u03c0\u2206,\u03c0\u2206(E),Z\u03c0\u2206,\u03c1N(E)andZ\u03c0\u2206,\u03c3N(E).\nWe cast Eq. (2.15) into a more convenient form for practical calculations. Applying the standard projection operator\ntechniques [97], the coupled equations of P space ( N\u2217and MB) and Q space ( \u03c0\u03c0N) are given as\nTPP(E)=\u00afVPP(E)+\u00afVPP(E)P\nE\u2212H0+i\u03f5TPP(E), (2.17)\nTQP(E)=VQP[1+P\nE\u2212H0+i\u03f5TPP(E)], (2.18)\n\u00afV(E)=VPP+VPQQ\nE\u2212H0+i\u03f5VQP. (2.19)\nHere, for example, TQP=QTP, and VQP=QV Pusing projection operators PandQof the Fock-spaces P and Q.\nThe effective interactions for N\u2217and MB \u00afVPPbecome energy dependent due to the channel coupling. The eliminated\n\u03c0\u03c0Nintermediate states generate the energy dependent particle exchange interaction Z\u03b2,\u03b1(E)shown in Fig. 4 and the\nself-energies of unstable particles for the \u03c0\u2206, \u03c1Nand\u03c3NGreen\u2019s functions. The P space in the above equation contains\nN\u2217and MB. The equation for the two-body MB T-matrix is obtained by eliminating N\u2217components or, equivalently,\nby the two-potential formula of Eq. (2.61) for the JBW approach. The full description of the coupled-channels equation\nis given in Appendix B of Ref. [11].\nThe partial wave T-matrix of M(p)+B(\u2212p)\u2192M\u2032(p\u2032)+B\u2032(\u2212p\u2032)is given as\nT\u03b2,\u03b1(p\u2032, p;E)=t\u03b2,\u03b1(p\u2032, p;E)+tR\n\u03b2,\u03b1(p\u2032, p;E), (2.20)\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2represent the MB states \u03c0N, \u03b7N, \u03c1N, \u03c3N, \u03c0 \u2206, in addition, external current JNfor\u03b1and angular momentum\nand isospin. The first term in Eq.

(2.22)\nHere, the energy dependent particle exchange interaction Z\u03b2,\u03b1(p\u2032, p;E)is due to the coupling of MB states with the \u03c0\u03c0N\nstates. The integration path C, in principle ranging from q=0to\u221e, will be discussed later.\nThe meson-baryon Green\u2019s function for the stable particles ( \u03c0N, \u03b7N, K \u039b, K\u03a3) and unstable particles ( \u03c0\u2206, \u03c1N, \u03c3N)\n9\n\nFigure 5: Graphical representations of T\u03c0\u03c0N,MB defined by Eq.

Meson-baryon interactions in the JBW approach and its SU(3) structure\nThe interaction of mesons and baryons in the Juelich-Bonn (JB) approach is parametrized through the Wess-Zumino\neffective Lagrangian [98]. Chiral symmetry of QCD is one of the guiding principles for its construction. The interaction\nalso contains vector mesons. While there are general guiding principles to include them [99, 100], the JB approach adopts\nthe version of Ref. [98]. The starting point is the nucleon and the pion field in a nonlinear \u03c3model. Vector mesons\nare then included by gauging the chirally invariant Lagrangian, i.e., by requiring the Lagrangian to be invariant under\nlocal transformations, leading to vector and axial gauge fields. The \u03c1\u03c0\u03c0coupling strength is related to f\u03c0via the KSFR\nrelation [101]. The Wess-Zumino Lagrangian provides \u03c0NN,\u03c1NN,\u03c1\u03c0\u03c0, and a1\u03c1\u03c0interactions; there are are also contact\nterms that contribute. See Appendix B of Ref. [53] for a list.\nThe SU(3) extension of the approach is achieved by relating these interactions to other hadrons via flavor symme-\ntry [53], based on Ref. [102]. The coupling of a given meson nonet with the octet baryon current 8B\u22978Byields two\nproducts, namely 8B\u22978B\u22971Mand8B\u22978B\u22978M. The coupling to the meson octet 8Mdepends on two parameters,\ng1, g2, corresponding to the symmetric and antisymmetric representations of 8B\u22978B. They can be re-written in terms\nof a coupling constant gand a mixing parameter \u03b1in the notation of Ref. [102] that is used in the JBW as well,\ng=\u221a\n30\n40g1+\u221a\n6\n24g2, \u03b1=\u221a\n6\n24g2\ng. (2.33)\nHere g1andg2can be also expressed in terms of the standard DandFaxial couplings [103]:\nD=\u221a\n30\n40g1, F=\u221a\n6\n24g2, (2.34)\nleading to \u03b1=F/(D+F). The coupling of the baryon octets to the meson singlet 1Minvolves a further independent\ncoupling constant. For the transitions MB\u2192MB, with the JP=0\u2212octet mesons Mand the JP=1/2+octet baryons B,\nthe JB model includes the full set of diagrams required by SU(3) symmetry. This applies to the classes of diagrams of the\nexchange of JP=1\u2212vector mesons, JP=1/2+baryons, and JP=3/2+baryons. In particular, non-diagonal transitions\nsuch as \u03b7N\u2192KY(Y=\u039b,\u03a3) are considered. See Appendix B2 of Ref. [53] for further details.\nThe same reference also provides information on how several processes not covered by SU(3) symmetry are modeled.\nFor example, the coupling of scalar mesons to nucleons, \u03c3NN, and among themselves, \u03c3\u03c3\u03c3, is described by Lagrangians\nwith couplings strengths fit to data. Similarly, \u03c0\u2206\u2206and\u03c1\u2206\u2206interaction are allowed for, with interaction strength fixed\nfrom fits to data or external information. The physical \u03c9and\u03d5states are defined by ideal mixing of \u03c91and\u03c98states.\nEffective Lagrangians for higher spin nucleon and \u2206excited states with J\u22643/2are listed in Appendix B of Ref. [104].\nResonance interactions with total spin J\u22655/2are not described by corresponding Lagrangians but their decay vertices are\nrelated to those of lower spin with additional powers of momentum ensuring the correct centrifugal barriers. In general,\ns-channel resonances are allowed to couple to the MB (pseudo-scalar octet, baryon octet) channels \u03c0N,\u03b7N,K\u039bandK\u03a3\nwith independent coupling strength not related through SU(3) symmetry. Additionally, resonances can couple to \u03c0\u2206and\n\u03c1Nstates, but not to \u03c3N. The argument is that, as long as the JBW model does not analyze \u03c0\u03c0Ndata, there is no\nneed to populate each possible \u03c0\u03c0Nthree-particle states. There is usually more than one independent way to combine\nspin and angular momentum of \u03c1, Nor\u03c0,\u2206to a given JP(see Table 1), but the JB model uses only one resonance\nLagrangian suitably projected into different \u03c0\u2206and\u03c1Nchannels, with only one coupling constant, for simplicity.\n2.4. From interactions to scattering in the JBW approach\nFor the construction of interactions from Lagrangians, the JB group uses TOPT [105]. The resulting pseudo-potentials\nare combined into s-,t-, and u-channel diagrams which are summed up by solving a three-dimensional integral equation of\nLippmann-Schwinger type with relativistic kinematics. Such a three-dimensional scattering equation leads to a simplified\nsingularity structure, as compared to that of a four-dimensional treatment in the context of the Bethe-Salpeter equation\n(BSE) discussed in Sect. 2.7.1, although even in a three-dimensional formalism using TOPT one has \u201cmoving\u201c singularities\nin exchange processes that depend on the incoming and outgoing momenta and the energy. More details are provided in\nSect. 2.8.\nThroughtheLegendretransformation(2.10)theWess-ZuminoLagrangedensity[98]isconvertedtoaHamiltondensity\nHthat is decomposed as\nH=H0\u2212Lint+Hct (2.35)\nwith a non-interacting part H0, an interacting part, and contact interactions Hct. The latter originate if the interaction\npart contains explicit time derivatives of fields, or non-dynamical zero-components of vector fields [106]. Then, the contact\nterms restore the on-shell equivalence between the time-ordered and the covariant formalism. In practical terms, it is\n11\n\nstraightforward to construct the contact terms at the diagrammatic level as the difference of the covariant Feynman\nexpression and both time orderings,\nVct=VFeyn\u2212V1st TO\nTOPT\u2212V2nd TO\nTOPT . (2.36)\nThe Hamiltonian is obtained by integrating Hover the spatial coordinates and can, again, be written in terms of a free\nand an interacting part, H=H0+HI. In terms of the Hamiltonian, the scattering operator reads\nS=lim\nt\u2192\u221e\nt0\u2192\u2212\u221e\u02c6U(t, t0), (2.37)\nwhere \u02c6U(t, t0)=eiH0te\u2212iH(t\u2212t0)e\u2212iH0t0is the evolution operator in the interaction picture. The (onshell) T-matrix has\nthe quantum mechanical normalization\nSfi=\u2236\u03b4fi\u2212i(2\u03c0)\u03b4(Ef\u2212Ei)Tfi, (2.38)\nwhere i(f)denote initial (final state) and Ei, Efare the respective energies. The on-energy shell T-matrix operator can\nbe written as\nT=HI+HI1\nE\u2212H+i\u03f5HI=HI+HI1\nE\u2212H0\u2212HI+i\u03f5HI. (2.39)\nOne can expand Tin a power series in HI,\nT=HI1\n1\u2212GHI=HI+HIGHI+. . . (2.40)\nwith the Green\u2019s function of the free particle states,\nG=1\nE\u2212H0+i\u03f5=\u2a0bn\u2223n\u27e9\u27e8n\u2223\nE\u2212En+i\u03f5. (2.41)\nThe sum/integral over the right-hand side formally extends over all multi-particle states allowed, and nis a composite\nindex for continuous and discrete variables. The next step towards writing a scattering equation consists in representing\nthe perturbation series of Eq. (2.40) through matrix elements obtained from diagrams derived from HIthrough TOPT\nrules that are similar to standard Feynman rules. The main differences consists in the occurrence of non-covariant TOPT\ncontact terms that arise in addition to contact terms from the vector mesons from the Wess-Zumino Lagrangian itself\nas mentioned before. In the Green\u2019s function, one can explicitly separate 2-particle intermediate states off the rest,\nG=\u02dcG+G(2), arriving at\nT=V+VG(2)T (2.42)\nwith an effective potential\nV=HI1\n1\u2212\u02dcGHI, (2.43)\nthat contains the intermediate states with more than two particles. Furthermore, both the potential Vand the T-matrix\ncan be generalized to the off-shell case E\u2260Ei\u2260Ef,\nTfi=Vfi+\u2a0bjVfjTji\nE\u2212Ej\u2212\u03c9j+i\u03f5, (2.44)\nfor initial, final, and intermediate two-body states. The index jindicates the sum over discrete quantum numbers like\nparticle spins, two-body channels, and continuous three-momenta q1andq2with states normalized as \u27e8q\u2223q\u2032\u27e9=\u03b4(q\u2212q\u2032)\nand baryon and meson energies\nEj=\u221a\nM2\nB+q2\n1, \u03c9 j=\u221a\nm2\nM+q2\n2, (2.45)\nwhere MBandmMare the baryon and meson masses, respectively. In the center-of mass frame where the momenta of\ninitial and final particles fulfill p1+p2=p3+p4, the matrix elements of A\u2208{T,V}can be written in terms of A\u2208{T, V}\nas\n\u27e8p3,p4, \u03bb3, \u03bb4, \u00b5, I, I 3\u2223A(E)\u2223p1,p2, \u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bd, I, I 3\u27e9=\u03b4(p3+p4\u2212p1\u2212p2)AI\n\u00b5\u03bd(E,p\u2032, \u03bb\u2032,p, \u03bb), (2.46)\n12\n\nwhere p=p1,p\u2032=p3,\u00b5and\u03bdare channel indices (\u03c0N, \u03b7N, K \u039b, K\u03a3, \u03c9N, . . . ), and Iis the total isospin. Furthermore,\n\u03bb=\u03bb1\u2212\u03bb2and\u03bb\u2032=\u03bb3\u2212\u03bb4are helicity indices for the helicities of incoming and outgoing states [107]. With these\nsimplifications, Eq. (2.44) reads\nTI\n\u00b5\u03bd(p\u2032, \u03bb\u2032,p, \u03bb;E)=VI\n\u00b5\u03bd(p\u2032, \u03bb\u2032,p, \u03bb;E)+\u2211\n\u03ba,\u03bb\u2032\u2032\u222bd3q VI\n\u00b5\u03ba(p\u2032, \u03bb\u2032,q, \u03bb\u2032\u2032;E)1\nE\u2212E\u03ba(q)\u2212\u03c9\u03ba(q)+i\u03f5TI\n\u03ba\u03bd(q, \u03bb\u2032\u2032,p, \u03bb;E),\n(2.47)\nwhich formally resembles a Lippmann-Schwinger equation with relativistic energies. Note that this is similar to the\nThompson equation [33, 35, 36]. Three-body states can then be re-inserted as individual channels instead of effective\npotentials, ordered by quantum numbers. This is discussed in Sect. 2.7.2. Note that the above equation is identical to\nthe one of the ANL-Osaka approach in Eq. (2.14). If one aims at obtaining the interactions Vfrom Lagrangians leading\nto a vertex \u00afVby using TOPT rules, one has to insert a conversion factor [46],\nA(p\u2032,p)=1\n(2\u03c0)3\u221a\nM3\nE3(p\u2032)\u221a\nM1\nE1(p)1\u221a\n2\u03c94(p\u2032)1\u221a\n2\u03c92(p)\u00afA , (2.48)\nwhere, again, Astands for VorTand\u03c92(\u03c94)are the incoming (outgoing) meson energies and analogously for baryon\nenergies E1(E3). This corresponds to the normalization [46]\nSfi=\u03b4fi\u2212i(2\u03c0)\u22122\u03b44(Pf\u2212Pi)\u221a\nM3\nE3\u221a\nM1\nE11\u221a2\u03c941\u221a2\u03c92\u00afTfi, (2.49)\nwhich implies that\n\u00afV(E,p\u2032, \u03bb\u2032,p, \u03bb)=\u00afu(p\u2032, \u03bb\u2032)\u0393u(p, \u03bb) (2.50)\nwith Dirac spinors normalized to \u00afuu=1and\u0393containing the entire spin and isospin structure of the transition. These\n\u00afVare related to the transition potentials quoted as Vin the Appendix of Ref. [53] according to\nV=\u221a\nM3\nE3\u221a\nM1\nE1\u00afV . (2.51)\nNote that separation of the identity and interacting part (the reaction amplitude T) from the S-matrix differ vastly\nin the literature. For example, in many meson-baryon studies (see, e.g., Ref. [39, 42, 43, 108\u2013110]) canonical H\u00f6hler\nnomenclature [111] defines \u02c6S=1+i\u02c6Ton the level of operators and then utilizes spinors normalized as \u00afuf(p)ui(p)=\n2MN\u03b4fiwhiledefiningthegeneralLorentzinvariantandparityconservingT-matrixelementforameson-baryontransition\nM(q)B(p)\u2192M(q\u2032)B(p\u2032)as\nMfi=1\n8\u03c0\u221as\u00afuf(p\u2032)(A(s, t)+/q\u2032+/q\n2B(s, t))ui(p). (2.52)\nUltimately, the scalar quantities A, Bare used to define partial-wave amplitudes, relating also to observable quantities\nlike phase-shifts or cross sections.\n2.5. Partial-wave projection\nDynamical coupled-channel models deal with s-channels containing spin-1/2 nucleons but also the spin-3/2 \u2206and spin-1\nvector mesons (\u03c1, \u03c9). The partial-wave projection of A\u2208{V, T}in the scattering equation (2.47) is a two-step process; as\nhelicity and angular momentum commute, one can expand the helicity eigenstates in terms of eigenstates of total angular\nmomentum. In particular, with incoming (outgoing) helicities \u03bb1, \u03bb2(\u03bb3, \u03bb4), the quantity Aas written in the states\n\u2223p\u2032, \u03bb3, \u03bb4\u27e9and\u2223p, \u03bb1, \u03bb2\u27e9can be decomposed as [107, 112]\n\u27e8p\u2032, \u03bb\u2032\u2223A\u2223p, \u03bb\u27e9=1\n4\u03c0\u2211\nJ(2J+1)DJ\u2217\n\u03bb\u03bb\u2032(\u2126p\u2032p,0)\u27e8p\u2032, \u03bb\u2032\u2223AJ\u2223p, \u03bb\u27e9, (2.53)\nthat depends only on the helicity differences \u03bb\u2236=\u03bb1\u2212\u03bb2and\u03bb\u2032\u2236=\u03bb3\u2212\u03bb4. Here, Dare the Wigner-D functions with\n\u2126p\u2032pthe solid angle between p(incoming nucleon) and p\u2032(outgoing nucleon). We choose \u2126p\u2032p=(\u03d50, \u03b80)in the specific\ngeometry where particle 1 (nucleon) comes in along the +z-direction and particle 3 (nucleon) leaves at angles \u03d50and\n\u03b80[112]. Note that in some papers one can find a slightly different PWA expression, with the connection to the above\none discussed in Sect. IIE of Ref. [113]. The inverse is given by\n\u27e8p\u2032, \u03bb\u2032\u2223AJ\u2223p, \u03bb\u27e9=2\u03c01\n\u222b\n\u22121d(cos\u03b8)dJ\n\u03bb\u03bb\u2032(\u03b8)\u27e8p\u2032, \u03bb\u2032\u2223A\u2223p, \u03bb\u27e9, (2.54)\n13\n\nfor which p=(0,0, p)\u22baandp\u2032=(p\u2032sin\u03b8,0, p\u2032cos\u03b8)\u22bais usually chosen for simplicity. The second step concerns the\ntransformation from helicity to JLS basis. For total spin Jwith third component Mone has\n\u2223JM\u03bb 1\u03bb2\u27e9=\u2211\nLS\u27e8JMLS\u2223JM\u03bb 1\u03bb2\u27e9 \u2223JMLS\u27e9 (2.55)\nwith orbital angular momentum Land total spin Sthat is the sum of the individual spins. For example, the \u03c1Nstates\ncan have S=1/2orS=3/2. The transformation matrix is given by Clebsch-Gordan coefficients [112],\n\u27e8J\u2032M\u2032LS\u2223JM\u03bb 1\u03bb2\u27e9=\u221a\n2L+1\n2J+1\u27e8L0S\u03bb\u2223J\u03bb\u27e9\u27e8S1\u03bb1S2\u2212\u03bb2\u2223S\u03bb\u27e9\u03b4JJ\u2032\u03b4MM\u2032, (2.56)\nwhere, again, \u03bb=\u03bb1\u2212\u03bb2. After these transformations, the partial-wave projected scattering equation in the c.m. frame,\nfor given isospin Iand spin-parity JP, reads [51, 52, 104, 114, 115]\nT\u00b5\u03bd(p\u2032, p;E)=V\u00b5\u03bd(p\u2032, p;E)+\u2211\n\u03ba\u221e\n\u222b\n0dq q2V\u00b5\u03ba(p\u2032, q;E)G\u03ba(q;E)T\u03ba\u03bd(q, p;E), (2.57)\nwhere p\u2032\u2261\u2223p\u2032\u2223(p\u2261\u2223p\u2223) is the modulus of the outgoing (incoming) three-momentum that may be on- or off-shell, E=\u221as\nis the scattering energy, and \u00b5, \u03bd, \u03baare channel indices. In Eq. (2.57), the propagator for a stable meson and a stable\nbaryon is given by\nG\u03ba=1\nE\u2212E\u03ba(q)\u2212\u03c9\u03ba(q)+i\u03f5, (2.58)\nwith energies from Eq. (2.45). The propagators for unstable channels are more complicated as discussed in Sect. 2.7.2.\nNote that there are different possibilities for the \u03c0\u2206and\u03c1Nchannels to couple to a given JP, that are counted as\nindividual channels. The complete coupling scheme (applying to s-,t-, and u-channel exchanges) is shown in Table 1.\nThere, the total spin S=\u2223SN+S\u03c1\u2223is given by the sum of the \u03c1spin and the nucleon spin, and Lis the orbital angular\nmomentum.\n2.6. Channels and transitions\nBoth the ANL-Osaka and the JB models include two-body channels with stable hadrons, \u03c0N,\u03b7N,K\u039b,K\u03a3, and \u03c9N,\nas well as \u03c0\u2206,\u03c3N, and \u03c1N. The unstable \u201cisobars\u201d in the latter three channels stand for two-body sub-channels with\nsub-energy-dependent amplitude rather than simple resonances, see Sect. 2.7.2. The extension of the original JBW model\nto include the K\u039bandK\u03a3channels was carried out in Ref. [104], while the \u03c9Nchannel was added only recently by\nWang et al. [58]. In the same work, to make the dynamics of the K\u03a3system complete, the exchange of a0was added for\ntheK\u039b\u2192K\u03a3andK\u03a3\u2192K\u03a3transitions. For a summary of exchange diagrams see Fig. 2 and Table 2, Ref. [53], or the\nsupplementary material of Ref. [58] for the current status.\nIn the ANL-Osaka model [78, 87], the meson-baryon interaction is constructed as described in Sect. 2.2.3. The hadron\nexchange mechanisms of this model are also summarized Table 2. K\u039bandK\u03a3channels are included in [87].

The u-channel exchange plays a special role in the context of three-body\nchannels that are included both in the ANL-Osaka and JBW models. As discussed in Sect. 2.7.2 three-body unitarity\nin the JBW approach requires u-channel exchange contributions in the potential Vleading to moving singularities that\ndepend both on incoming and outgoing momenta and energy. Correspondingly, the solution of the integral equation (2.47)\nrequires a tailored treatment discussed in Sect. 2.9.1. Figure 2 illustrates the nucleon u-channel exchange in the \u03c0N\u2192\u03c0\u2206\ntransition as one of several processes required by unitarity.

(2.59), VCT, contains phenomenological contact terms that are added to the interaction in a\ngiven partial wave [55]. These interactions are separable both in channel and momentum space; the correct threshold\nbehavior is built into the \u03b3CTfor each channel \u00b5. These contact terms absorb contributions beyond the ones explicitly\nincluded in the model. As discussed in Sect. 2.4, there are also contact terms arising at the Lagrangian level or from the\nTOPT formalism requiring on-shell equivalence with Feynman formalism. These terms are associated with VNP.\n2.6.2. The t-channel transitions and correlated two-pion exchange\nIn the JBW model, the t-channel exchanges are, on one hand, given by the exchange of scalar and vector mesons. As\nexplainedinthesupplementarymaterialofRef.[58]theexchangeofthevectormesonandscalarmesonnonetexceptforthe\n\u03ba-meson is included. They provide realistic meson-baryon interactions that contribute to all partial waves simultaneously.\nSecond, there are t-channel pion exchanges for non-diagonal transitions such as \u03c0N\u2192\u03c1Nor\u03c0N\u2192\u03c3N. Unlike other\nt-channel exchanges, these nondiagonal transitions go on-shell in the inelastic physical region\u221as>2m\u03c0+MNas required\nby unitarity, similar to the above-discussed u-channel exchanges (see Sect. 2.7.1).\nThird, in the JBW model the most prominent t-channel exchanges in \u03c0Nscattering, namely the scalar-isoscalar and\nthe vector-isovector channels, are not mediated via explicit meson fields but by correlated \u03c0\u03c0exchange as introduced in\nRef. [46]. The correlated two-pion exchange is related to the N\u00afN\u2192\u03c0\u03c0amplitude as schematically indicated in Fig. 6.\nThe idea [46] is to relate a model that describes \u201cquasi-empirical\u201d data of the N\u00afN\u2192\u03c0\u03c0and\u03c0\u03c0amplitudes to the\n\u03c0N\u2192\u03c0Nreaction through crossing symmetry. The N\u00afN\u2192\u03c0\u03c0were obtained by analytic continuation of \u03c0Nand elastic\n\u03c0\u03c0data into the unphysical region below the N\u00afNthreshold [111, 117, 118]. The amplitudes f0\n+(t)andf1\n\u00b1(t)describing\nthem are related to the partial-wave projected invariant A(+)\n\u03c3,B(+)\n\u03c3andA(\u2212)\n\u03c1,B(\u2212)\n\u03c1amplitudes, respectively, where the\nupper index labels isoscalar (+)and isovector (\u2212)amplitudes. For the Dirac structures associated with AandB, see\nEq. (2.52). The invariant amplitudes can be related to the Tmatrix that can then be continued in different kinematic\nvariables to the crossed reaction. See Ref. [46] for more details of the calculation, including a discussion of how to avoid\ndouble-counting of processes generated through iteration of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation.\nIt should be emphasized that the correlated two-pion exchange is implemented at the level of the interaction Vand\nnot the s-channel unitarized amplitude T. More sophisticated dispersive treatments consider crossing symmetry at the\namplitude level (Roy Steiner equations) [119\u2013121] and have been recently continued to complex energies to, e.g., extract\nthe pole of the Roper resonance [122].\n2.6.3. The s-channel transitions, two-potential formalism, and renormalization\nThes-channel processes play a special role as they are separable and allow for the separation into a \u201cpole part\u201d and a\n\u201cnon-pole\u201d part through the two-potential formalism. This is illustrated for the ANL-Osaka model in Sect. 2.2.3. For\nthe JBW model, a very similar separation is discussed in Ref. [53]. In DCC approaches, the backwards-going parts\nofs-channel processes and channel propagation are usually neglected, but their role has been quantified for a mesonic\nsystems some time ago [123]. In the ANL-Osaka model, the pair production processes are included in the potential as\ndiscussed on Eq. (2.14), while the backwards-going propagation of the bare excited baryons are not included.\nOn the one hand, resonance poles in the T-matrix can arise from solving the nonlinear scattering equation with only t-\nandu-channel exchanges. Such states are usually referred to as \u201cdynamically generated\u201d. In the JBW model, this occurs,\ne.g., for the Roper resonance [51]. On the other hand, and in most of the cases, resonances are accounted for by explicit\ns-channel exchanges. These are simple singularities of Vin energy E=\u221asthat move into the complex energy plane\nonce they are unitarized in the Lippmann-Schwinger equation (2.47). In the JBW model, s-channel baryonic states are\nincluded via Lagrangians up to spin J=3/2, see, e.g., Table B.8 of Ref. [104]. For higher spin, resonances are related to\n16\n\ntheir lower-spin pendants by adding suitable barrier factors [104]. With this input, the partial-wave projected resonance\ncreation and annihilation vertices \u03b3a\n\u00b5and\u03b3c\n\u03bdof Eq. (2.59) are calculated containing coupling constants to be fit to data.\nIn the following we discuss the \u201ctwo-potential formalism\u201d in the JB model that allows one to separate off s-channel\nexchanges. In the ANL-Osaka model a similar decomposition is performed as given in Eqs. (2.20), (2.21) and (2.26).\nThe full scattering T-matrix of Eq. (2.57) can be written as the sum of \u201cpole\u201d and \u201cnon-pole\u201d part [53],\nT\u00b5\u03bd=TP\n\u00b5\u03bd+TNP\n\u00b5\u03bd, (2.61)\nwhich is the same decomposition as the one into the \u201cresonant\u201d and \u201dnon-resonant\u201d part in the ANL-Osaka formulation\nof Eq. (2.20). First, all t- and u-channel contributions, VNPfrom Eq. (2.59), are unitarized in the non-pole part,\nTNP\n\u00b5\u03bd=VNP\n\u00b5\u03bd+\u2211\n\u03baVNP\n\u00b5\u03baG\u03baTNP\n\u03ba\u03bd, (2.62)\nin operator notation implying integration over the second term. This part can actually develop poles that are dynamically\ngenerated through the non-linearity in VNP. An example is given by the Roper resonance discussed in Sec. 3.3.7.\nContributions from the s-channel exchanges, the pole part TP, can be evaluated from the non-pole part TNPgiven in\nEq. (2.62). For this, we define the following quantities using the bare vertices of Eq. (2.59):\n\u0393c\n\u00b5;i=\u03b3c\n\u00b5;i+\u2211\n\u03bd\u03b3c\n\u03bd;iG\u03bdTNP\n\u03bd\u00b5,\u0393a\n\u00b5;i=\u03b3a\n\u00b5;i+\u2211\n\u03bdTNP\n\u00b5\u03bdG\u03bd\u03b3a\n\u03bd;i,\u03a3ij=\u2211\n\u00b5\u03b3c\n\u00b5;iG\u00b5\u0393a\nj;\u00b5, (2.63)\nwhere \u0393c(\u0393a) are the \u201cdressed resonance creation (annihilation) vertices\u201d and \u03a3is the \u201cself-energy\u201d. The indices i, jlabel\nthes-channel state in the case of multiple resonances. For the two-resonance case with bare masses m1andm2, the pole\npart reads explicitly [124]\nTP\n\u00b5\u03bd=\u0393a\n\u00b5D\u22121\u0393c\n\u03bd, (2.64)\nwhere\n\u0393a\n\u00b5=(\u0393a\n\u00b5;1,\u0393a\n\u00b5;2),\u0393c\n\u00b5=(\u0393c\n\u00b5;1\n\u0393c\n\u00b5;2), D=(E\u2212mb\n1\u2212\u03a311 \u2212\u03a312\n\u2212\u03a321 E\u2212mb\n2\u2212\u03a322), (2.65)\nwith inverse propagator D, from which the one-resonance case follows immediately. This decomposition is widely used in\nthe literature, see, e.g., Refs. [11, 45, 125, 126]. The non-pole part TNPis sometimes referred to as background , although\nthe unitarization of Eq. (2.62) may lead to dynamically generated poles in TNP. In turn, TPcontains constant and\nother terms beyond the pole contribution of the Laurent expansion [114]. This demonstrates that a decomposition into\nresonant and non-resonant contribution according to the two-potential formalism is not identical to terms of the Laurent\nexpansion, showing that this separation is not unique, and that it is difficult to attribute physical properties to them in\na model-independent way.\nHowever, there is a numerical advantage to this separation: All s-,t-, and u- channel exchanges have free fit parameters\nto be matched to data. Some parameters come through the form factors in t-,u- channel exchanges while others, the pole\nparameters, come through resonances coupling to the photon and hadronic channels. The two-potential formalism allows\nfor hierarchical fit structures: One starts by evaluating TNPonce, with a given set of t-, and u-channel \u201cslow\u201d parameters.\nEvaluating VNPis the numerical bottleneck because it requires the partial-wave projection of all matrix elements in\nmomentum and channel space. Once these transitions are evaluated, one optimizes all pole parameters plus the separable\ncontact terms discussed in Sect. 2.6.1. Indeed, due to their separable form, the latter can be organized in a structure\nvery similar to the two-potential formalism for resonances [55] discussed before. Once these fast-evaluating parts of the\namplitude are optimized, the next optimization step of slow parameters takes place, involving another evaluation of VNP.\nThere is one special s-channel exchange that accounts for the nucleon itself. Its spin-parity of JP=1/2+corresponds\nto the P11partial wave that also hosts the Roper resonance N(1440)and higher-lying states. Parameterizing the nucleon\npole in terms of an s-channel singularity, V\u223c(fb\nN)2/(E\u2212Mb\nN)makes it apparent that the bare \u03c0NNcoupling fb\nNand\nbare mass Mb\nNundergo a renormalization such that the pole of the fully dressed T-matrix is at the physical nucleon mass,\nMN, and its residue equals the residue induced by the physical \u03c0NNcoupling, f\u03c0NN. The renormalization depends on\nthe included number of channels, the non-pole (i.e., t-,u-and contact) interactions, and the regularization. In principle,\none could numerically ensure the physical nucleon mass and coupling by fitting Mb\nNandfb\nNtoMNandf\u03c0NN.\nIt is also possible (and realized in the JBW model [53]) to perform the renormalization analytically by separating the\nnucleon s-channel contributions from t- and u-channel contributions through the discussed two-potential formalism [45,\n127]. Following Eq. (2.65), the pole part TPin the one-resonance, one-channel ( \u03c0N) case, with an s-channel nucleon\nexchange of bare mass Mb\nN, can be written as\nTP=\u0393a\u0393c\nE\u2212Mb\nN\u2212\u03a3(E). (2.66)\n17\n\nWe require that TPhas a pole at the physical nucleon mass MNor, equivalently, that\nMN=Mb\nN+\u03a3(MN). (2.67)\nTo derive an expression for Mb\nNthat respects the renormalization condition (2.67) we expand the nucleon self-energy\nabout E=MN,\n\u03a3(E)=\u03a3(MN)+(E\u2212MN)\u2202\u03a3(E)\n\u2202E\u2223\nE=MN+O(E\u2212MN)2, (2.68)\nand define the reduced quantities \u02dc\u03a3and\u02dc\u0393a,cusing that the bare coupling fb\nN=x f\u03c0NNcan be factorized off \u03a3and\u0393,\n\u03a3=(fb\nN)2\u03a3red=x2f2\n\u03c0NN\u03a3red=x2\u02dc\u03a3,\n\u0393a,c=fb\nN\u0393red;a,c=x f\u03c0NN\u0393red;a,c=x\u02dc\u0393a,c. (2.69)\nInEq.(2.69), \u02dc\u03a3isthenucleonself-energycalculatedwiththephysicalnucleoncoupling f\u03c0NN, insteadofthebarecoupling.\nThe same applies to \u02dc\u0393a,c, and TPfrom Eq. (2.66) reads now\nTP=1\nE\u2212MN(x2\u02dc\u0393a\u02dc\u0393c\n1\u2212x2\u2202E\u02dc\u03a3)\nE=MN+O(E\u2212MN)0. (2.70)\nTo determine the bare coupling fb\nN,xis calculated: the physical residue of the nucleon pole in energy Eis given by\n(a\u22121)\u03c0N\u2192\u03c0N=\u02dc\u03b3a\u02dc\u03b3c, (2.71)\nwhere \u02dc\u03b3a,care the bare nucleon vertices calculated at E=MNwith the physical nucleon coupling f\u03c0NNinstead of the\nbare coupling (cf. Appendix B.1. of Ref. [104]). The residue in Eq. (2.71) has to agree with the residue of TPfrom\nEq. (2.70) at the pole position:\n(x2\u02dc\u0393a\u02dc\u0393c\n1\u2212x2\u2202E\u02dc\u03a3)\nE=MN=(a\u22121)\u03c0N\u2192\u03c0N, (2.72)\nleading to\n1\nx2=(\u2202E\u02dc\u03a3+\u02dc\u0393a\u02dc\u0393c\n\u02dc\u03b3a\u02dc\u03b3c)\nE=MN. (2.73)\nThe bare mass Mb\nNis then\nMb\nN=MN\u2212x2\u02dc\u03a3(MN). (2.74)\nThismatchingprocedureisvalidforthenucleonincaseitcouplesonlytothe \u03c0Nchannel. InRef.[51], therenormalization\nfor one bare s-channel state coupling to more than one channel is developed. In Ref. [53] the renormalization procedure\nin presence of an additional s-channel state, that may couples to all channels, is derived. This version is implemented in\nall versions of the JBW model thereafter. While the nucleon pole gets renormalized no attempt is made for a similar, self-\nconsistent treatment of the nucleon appearing in exchange potentials V\u00b5\u03bdor the propagation functions G\u03baof Eq. (2.57).\nInstead, the physical nucleon mass is used in these instances.\nIn the ANL-Osaka approach, the single nucleon state does not couple with MB states by construction and the nucleon\nstate only appears in the u- and s-channel potential and Z-diagrams, where the physical nucleon mass is used. The\nintroduction of a bare nucleon state within the model is examined in Ref. [128] for the analysis of the P11partial-wave\namplitude.\n2.7. Three-body unitarity and its implementation for the \u03c3N, \u03c1Nand\u03c0\u2206channels\n2.7.1. The S-matrix and its unitarity\nWe illustrate how unitarity relates imaginary parts of the isobar-spectator propagation to imaginary parts of their interac-\ntion via u-channel processes. For the ANL-Osaka and the JBW models, the isobars refer to the resonant \u03c0Nchannel P33\nfor the \u2206and to the \u03c3and\u03c1quantum numbers for the two-pion amplitudes as discussed in Sect. 2.7.2. For three-meson\nsystems (Sect. 4), there are resonant channels but also non-resonant isobars [113], for example the repulsive 3\u03c0+system\nthat does not host any resonances [129].\n18\n\nFor simplicity, the argument in this subsection is outlined in terms of spinless particles and isobars following Ref. [130].\nA relativistic, infinite-volume three-body scattering amplitude was formulated in Ref. [130] following much earlier work\nby Aaron, Amado and Young [131]. It can be expressed in terms of on-shell, two-body unitary 2\u21922amplitudes (the\nisobars), complex exchange processes, and genuine three-body interactions containing the microscopic dynamics, which\nare forced to be real-valued by three-body unitarity. In the following we collect only the main results of the derivation,\nrelevant for this review, and refer the reader for details to the original work [130].\nThe central quantity of most theoretical approaches to the properties of excited hadrons is the S-matrix, introduced\nin the first half of 20thcentury, see, e.g., Refs. [132, 133]. It relates asymptotically free states in the far past to those\nin the distant future. Consider nincoming and moutgoing spinless states with three-momenta {p}={p1, ...,pn}and\n{p\u2032}={p\u2032\n1, ...,p\u2032\nm}, respectively. The operators for the S- and T-matrix are\n\u27e8{p\u2032}\u2223\u02c6S\u2223{p}\u27e9=\u27e8{p\u2032}\u2223(1+i\u02c6T)\u2223{p}\u27e9. (2.75)\nThe crucial point is that this allows one to formalize otherwise abstract principles of scattering theory in mathematical\nproperties of the S-matrix. In particular, the S-matrix obeys crossing symmetry ,analyticity andunitarity , see for more\ndetails Ref. [1] and references therein. In view of DCC approaches for hadron spectroscopy, analyticity and unitarity\nare of paramount importance. To be more specific, the S-matrix elements ( \u2208C) are analytic (holomorphic) functions of\n(3m+3n\u221210)kinematic variables ( \u2208C). At the boundary of physical kinematics ( \u2208R), the S-matrix elements are, indeed,\nrelated to the physical/observable quantities, such as, e.g., phase shifts \u03b4\u2113=argSl/(2i)for the n=m=2case, projected\nto the \u2113-th partial wave. The unitarity of the S-matrix,\n\u02c6S\u02c6S\u2020=1\u21d4\u02c6T\u2212\u02c6T\u2020=i\u02c6T\u2020\u02c6T , (2.76)\nputs another constraint on the imaginary parts of matrix elements and invariant matrix elements (M)\nM{p}\u2192{p\u2032}=(2\u03c0)4\u03b4(4)(n\n\u2211\ni=1pi\u2212m\n\u2211\ni=1p\u2032\ni)\u27e8{p\u2032}\u2223\u02c6T\u2223{p}\u27e9. (2.77)\nIn the case of one particle type (scalar with mass m) this unitarity constraint reads\n\u27e8{p\u2032}\u2223(\u02c6T\u2212\u02c6T\u2020)\u2223{p}\u27e9=i\u222bN\n\u220f\ni=1d4ki\n(2\u03c0)4(2\u03c0)\u03b4+(k2\ni\u2212m2)\u27e8{p\u2032}\u2223\u02c6T\u2020\u2223{k}\u27e9\u27e8{k}\u2223\u02c6T\u2223{p}\u27e9, (2.78)\nM{p}\u2192{p\u2032}\u2212M\u2217\n{p\u2032}\u2192{p}=i\u222bN\n\u220f\ni=1d4ki\n(2\u03c0)4(2\u03c0)\u03b4+(k2\ni\u2212m2)(2\u03c0)4\u03b4(4)(P\u2212N\n\u2211\ni=1ki)M\u2217\n{p\u2032}\u2192{k}M{p}\u2192{k}.\nHere, \u03b4+(k2\ni\u2212m2)selects the positive energy solution only and Pdenotes the total four momentum of the system. The\nfirst observation is that putting Nintermediate particles on-shell requires the system to have at least E\u2265N\u22c5mtotal\nenergy. The second observation is that when some set of intermediate particles can go on-shell, a discontinuity of the\nT-matrix elements is manifested along the real energy-axis \u2013 a branch cut \u2013 often referred to as the unitarity cut or\nright-hand cut.\nIn the following the 3\u21923case of the above unitarity condition is considered for identical, spinless particles of mass\nmand out- and in-going four-momenta p\u2032\n1, p\u2032\n2, p\u2032\n3andp1, p2, p3, respectively. The T-matrix consists of a fully connected\n(\u02c6Tc) and a once-disconnected piece ( \u02c6Td), related to the isobar-spectator scattering amplitude Tand isobar-propagator \u03c4\nas\n\u27e8p\u2032\n1, p\u2032\n2, p\u2032\n3\u2223\u02c6T\u2223p1, p2, p3\u27e9=\u27e8p\u2032\n1, p\u2032\n2, p\u2032\n3\u2223\u02c6Tc\u2223p1, p2, p3\u27e9+\u27e8p\u2032\n1, p\u2032\n2, p\u2032\n3\u2223\u02c6Td\u2223p1, p2, p3\u27e9 (2.79)\n=1\n3!3\n\u2211\nn=13\n\u2211\nm=1v(p\u2032\n\u00afn, p\u2032\n\u00af\u00afn)\u239b\n\u239d\u03c4(\u03c3(p\u2032\nn))T(p\u2032\nn, pm;s)\u03c4(\u03c3(pm))\u22122Ep\u2032n\u03c4(\u03c3(p\u2032\nn))(2\u03c0)3\u03b43(p\u2032\nn\u2212p\u2032\nm)\u239e\n\u23a0v(p\u00afm, p\u00af\u00afm),\nwhere Pis the total four-momentum of the system, s=E2=P2. All four-momenta p1, p\u2032\n1, ...are on-mass-shell, and the\nsquare of the invariant mass of the isobar reads\n\u03c3(p\u2032)\u2236=(P\u2212p\u2032)2=s+m2\nS\u22122\u221asEp\u2032 (2.80)\nfor spectator of mass mS=mand energy Ep\u2032. We work in the total center-of-mass frame where P=0. The dissociation\nvertex v(p, p\u2032)of the isobar decaying in asymptotically stable particles, e.g., \u03c1(p+p\u2032)\u2192\u03c0(p)\u03c0(p\u2032), is chosen to be cut-free\nin the relevant energy region, which is always possible. The notation is such that, e.g., for a spectator momentum pn, the\nisobar decays into two particles with momenta p\u00afnandp\u00af\u00afn.\nConsider again the connected isobar-spectator amplitude Tfrom Eq. (2.79). It appears twice on the right-hand side\nof the unitarity relation (2.78) as schematically depicted in Fig. 7 (a). The blue highlighted area shows the three stable\n19\n\nT\u2020T\n\u03c4B(a)(b)(c)Figure 7: (a) Unitarity relation for stable particles (single lines) with intermediate isobars (double lines). The on-shell, three-body, intermediate\nstate is populated by decaying isobars (shaded highlights) in two distinct ways: (b) by combining the isobar decay products to form a self\nenergy resulting in the propagator \u03c4, or (c) by combining a spectator and an isobar decay product to form a particle exchange B.\nintermediate particles that combine according to the integrations and \u03b4-functions in Eq. (2.78). As inserts (b) and (c)\nshow, there are two distinct ways for this to occur: (b) One can combine the isobar decay products to form a \u201cself energy\u201d\nor one can (c) combine a spectator with one of the isobar decay products. Next, one formulates a BSE ansatz for Tand\nrealizes combinations (b) and (c), leading to 8 terms. In Sect. 2.10.1 we quote the BSE in a different context. Equating\nthese terms to 8 diagrammatically equivalent terms on the left-hand side of Eq. (2.78) translates into 3 conditions: for the\nimaginary parts of \u03c4\u22121, imaginary parts of B, while also putting the intermediate spectator on the energy-shell, reducing\nthe BSE to a three-dimensional scattering equation that is manifestly unitary. The second condition leads through the\nuse of an un-subtracted dispersion relation to\nB(p\u2032, p;s)=\u2212\u03bb2\n2Ep\u2032+p(E\u2212Ep\u2032\u2212Ep\u2212Ep\u2032+p+i\u03f5), (2.81)\nwhere E=\u221as,E2\np\u2032+p=m2+(p+p\u2032)2etc., and pandp\u2032denote the on-shell four-momenta of the in- and outgoing spectator,\nrespectively. In addition, the dissociation vertex is chosen to be of simple scalar form, v(p, p\u2032)\u2236=\u03bb.\nThe first condition, on Im \u03c4\u22121, leads to the following form of the isobar propagator [130] using a twice subtracted\ndispersion relation,\n1\n\u03c4(\u03c3(q))=\u03c3(q)\u2212M2\n0\u2212\u222bd3k\n(2\u03c0)3\u03bb2\n2Ek(\u03c3(q)\u22124E2\nk+i\u03f5), (2.82)\nwhere M0is a free parameter that can be used to fit (together with \u03bband cutoff) the two-body amplitude corresponding\nto the considered isobar, T22\u2236=v\u03c4v. We refer to the exchange process in Eq. (2.81) as B-term in the following, and to\nthe integral term in Eq. (2.82) as self-energy. This formulation of two-body scattering for the isobars is used in both the\nANL-Osaka and JBW approaches, see Eq. (2.24) and the next subsection. It should be emphasized that there is no need\nfor\u03c4to be of this specific form. For S-wave isobars, an amplitude \u03c4\u2032with Im (\u03c4\u2032)\u22121=Imv2/\u03c4can also be used, removing\nvfactors from the B-term suitably. For p-wave isobars, a slightly different matching has to be performed because there\nis a genuine angular dependence in the decay vertices v[113, 134, 135].\nFinally, the last condition which puts the spectator on its energy-shell reduces the four-dimensional BSE to a three-\ndimensional scattering equation,\nT(p\u2032, p;s)=B(p\u2032, p;s)+C(p\u2032, p;s)\u2212\u222bd3q\n(2\u03c0)3(B(p\u2032, q;s)+C(p\u2032, q;s))\u03c4(\u03c3(q))\n2EqT(q, p;s). (2.83)\nHere we have added an additional real-valued term Cwhich does not impact the three-body unitarity constraints,\nparameterizing the so-called three-body force. Recently, the determination of this quantity through use of lattice QCD\nand Effective Field Theory became quite an active field of research [129, 136\u2013145]. Note however that Cis not an\nobservable quantity, meaning that it will always depend on the details of the integral equation and its regularization.\nNote also that the distribution of signs in Eqs. (2.81) and (2.83) is owed to the convention \u02c6S=1+i\u02c6Tin Ref. [130]. In\nthe JBW model for baryons, the \u201cInfinite-volume unitary\u201d (IVU) model for mesons discussed in Sect. 4), as well as the\nANL-Osaka model, the convention \u02c6S=1\u2212i\u02c6Tis adopted.\nIn the ANL-Osaka approach, expressions of the full amplitudes satisfying unitarity are given in [11]. In the actual\nnumerical analysis, the scattering amplitudes given in section 2.2.3 is used with the perturbative approximation of\nv\u03c0\u03c0N,MB, i.e., the direct two-pion production mechanism. Apart from this, to satisfy three-body unitarity, the interaction\nZin Eq. (2.22) illustrated in (c) of Fig. 7 and the self-energy \u03a3(q, E)in Eq. (2.24) illustrated in (b) of Fig. 7 play a\ncrucial role. The unitarity of the model is tested numerically.\nFinally, we also note that even if explicit isobar (or dimer) fields are used to parametrize the 2-body subsystem,\nthe isobar formulation is not an approximation but a re-parametrization of the full two-body amplitude as shown in\nRef. [146] and also discussed in Ref. [147].

The latter\ntwo requirements are also connected to the contour deformation method for the SMC that extends to these regions as\nwill be discussed in Sect. 2.9.3 in relation to Fig. 18.\n2.7.2. Three-body channels in the ANL-Osaka and JBW models\nBoth the ANL-Osaka [87, 149] and JBW approaches [53] incorporate three-body channels with the effective quantum\nnumbers of f0(500)N,\u03c1(770)N, and \u03c0\u2206(1232)3/2+, in short, called \u03c3N,\u03c1N, and \u03c0\u2206. As the \u03c1,\u2206, and nucleon have\nnon-zero spin, some of these channels can couple to a given, overall spin-parity JPin more than one way as shown in\nTable 1. The isobars are shown in Fig. 8. The total angular momentum is indicated with J, the orbital angular momentum\nbetween isobar and spectator with L, the baryon spin with S, and the meson isobar spin (for the \u03c1only) with S\u2032. The\norbital angular momentum between the isobar decay products, forming the self-energy \u03a3, is indicated with \u2113.\nOn the one hand, unitarity requires the inclusion of the complex isobars shown in Fig. 8. These structures simply\nexpress the physical process of realizing three particles \u03c0\u03c0N. The three-body Green\u2019s function G\u03bafor\u03ba\u2208{\u03c3N, \u03c1N, \u03c0 \u2206}\nis obtained by first fitting the isobar dissociation process vto the respective two-body phase shifts. For the \u03c3and\u2206\nquantum numbers in the JBW approach this was performed in Ref. [49]. The \u03c1isobar was fit to \u03c0\u03c0phase shifts in\nRef. [51]. The Green\u2019s functions G\u03baof the JBW are very similar to the ones of the ANL-Osaka approach. See Eq. (2.24)\nand Refs. [49, 51] for explicit expressions, i.e., they are parametrized with an isobar propagator and a re-summed self\nenergy as in Eq. (2.82).\nOn the other hand, as discussed in Sect. 2.7.1, the on-shell condition for \u03c0\u03c0Nmust also be realized through complex-\nvalued 3\u21923exchanges of isobar decay products. This reflects the fact that all three particles can go on-shell simulta-\nneously in the exchange process, if the energy is large enough. These transitions are shown in Fig. 4. In the context\nof the ANL-Osaka model, they are referred to as Z-diagrams; in the JBW model, these transitions are calculated using\ntime-ordered perturbation theory, and in both approaches they provide the necessary imaginary parts. In both models,\ns-channel and t-channel exchanges can be added to the amplitude to model the microscopic interactions as described in\nSect. 2.6. There are also 2\u21923transitions required by unitarity in the JBW approach, as shown in the last two diagrams\nof Fig. 2. In particular, there is an important pion exchange populating the \u03c3and\u03c1isobars, and a nucleon exchange\nto populate the \u03c0\u2206state. In Sect. 2.9.3 we discuss how the 3-body singularities from exchange processes require special\ncare when continuing the amplitude to complex energies to search for resonance poles.\nFor the meson-exchange models discussed in Sect. 4, three-body unitarity is guaranteed. Coupled-channel two-body\nunitarity is strictly fulfilled in the JBW model for light baryons, but only approximately for the three-body channels.\nOn the one hand, the included nucleon u-channel diagram develops an imaginary part above E=2m\u03c0+MN, but the\ncorresponding isobar-spectator channel (with quantum numbers \u03c0P11) is neglected in the inelastic region. On the other\nhand, form factors are used that at, large momenta, deviate from unity to guarantee the convergence of the scattering\nequation. For unitarity, these form factors should appear consistently in the corresponding isobar self energies. Indeed,\ncovariant form factors can be constructed for that purpose [134].\n2.8. Solving the scattering equation\nThe integral equation (2.57) can be solved along a complex spectator momentum contour (SMC) to avoid three-body\nsingularities from particle exchange processes, as well as two-body singularities. This is a common solution strategy for\nthe ANL-Osaka, JBW, and also the IVU approaches for excited baryons and mesons, respectively. For generic particles\nof mass maandmb, the two-body singularities are given as the solution of\u221as=Ea(p)+Eb(p),\npcm=1\n2E\u221a\n(E2\u2212(ma\u2212mb)2)(E2\u2212(ma+mb)2).

Also shown are the integration mesh points {p1,. .. ,p nSMC}, the on-shell point\nfor two-body channels of stable particles, pcm, and the on-shell region for three-body channels, p\u2208[0,pmax]. Right: Situation of three-body\nsingularities (dots) color coded for the corresponding parts of the SMC following a path \u0393Mfor cutoff regularization. See text for further\nexplanations.\nTo solve the integral equation, the complex contour is discretized into a suitable set of mesh points {pi}and integration\nweights, dp\u2192wi. With p, p\u2032, and qsampled at the same momenta {pi}, the integral equation becomes a set of linear\nequations. The solution is then known along a set of complex momenta for fixed\u221as. This is sufficient if one is only\ninterested in searching for resonance poles. For phase shifts and observables, however, one needs to know the solution for\nreal on-shell momenta p=pcm(\u221as)in case of stable two-body channels \u03ba. For this, the set of mesh points is enlarged,\n{pi}\u2192{pi, pcm}which provides on-shell \u2194off-shell and the physical on-shell \u2192on-shell transitions [150]. For n\u03bachannels\nof two stable particles and nSMCmesh points, the dimension of the numerical T-matrix is then n\u03ba\u22c5(nSMC+1). In\nreduction to one channel, it is easy to see that with matrix elements TI\nlk=T(pl, pk;E)with momenta from {pi, pcm}and,\nanalogously, Vlk, together with the discretized propagator matrix containing integration weights wi,\nGI=diag(w1p2\n1\nE\u2212E\u03ba(p1)\u2212\u03c9\u03ba(p1), . . . ,wnSMCp2\nnSMC\nE\u2212E\u03ba(pnSMC)\u2212\u03c9\u03ba(pnSMC),0), (2.85)\nthe T-matrix is obtained by matrix inversion of TI=V+V GITI, with the physical on-shell to on-shell scattering given by\nits(nSMC+1),(nSMC+1)matrix element. The generalization to n\u03bacoupled channels is obvious. The superscript Iserves\nto indicate the solution on the first Riemann sheet, in contrast to the solution on other sheets discussed in Sect. 2.9.2.\nSee also Ref. [151] for the role of contour deformations of Lorentz-invariant scattering equations.\nIn Fig. 9 to the left, some commonly used contours are shown. The JBW model uses regularization through form\nfactors, allowing for a straight integration path \u0393Binto the lower pplane as the integral back to the real axis at infinity\nvanishes (red line). An alternative to render the integrand convergent (allowing for an integration path to infinity) is by\nover-subtracting the dispersive propagation amplitude \u03c4making it automatically convergent, see Eq. (14) in Ref. [130].\nSimilarly, unitarity only determines the imaginary part of the particle exchange Bfrom Eq. (2.81), and over-subtracting\nit preserves unitarity while simultaneously guaranteeing the solution of the scattering equation [130].\nOne can also use a hard cutoff as shown with the green line \u0393Mand realized in Refs. [113, 142] for excited meson\nsystems (IVU model). The cutoff has to be large enough to not cut into the physically allowed state space, for all two-\nand three-body channels [142]. In any case, the cutoff \u039bhas to be chosen beyond all physically realizable momenta of\nthe two-body and three-body channels [113, 142], symbolized with the blue dot and blue line in Fig. 9 to the left. The\nformer stands for the two-body singularities at pcm, while the latter indicates the range [0, pmax]of physically allowed\nspectator momenta in three-body channels.\nThe right-hand side of Fig. 9 shows the solution p(p\u2032,cos\u03b8)ofB\u22121=0with the exchange term Bfrom Eq.

Right: Illustration of the integral path in the \"critical region\"\nfor fixed outgoing p\u2032, shown in the complex plane of incoming momentum p. The integration starts at the origin on the first Riemann sheet.\nThen, it goes around the logarithmic singularity at P, passing through the cut down onto the second Riemann sheet, and back to Q, that\nindicates the origin on the second Riemann sheet. From there, the integration follows the original SMC \u0393with a smooth analytic transition\nofBatRfrom second sheet, BII, back to the first sheet, BI.\nwhere\n\u03b1=\u221as\u2212\u221a\nm2\n3+p\u20322, \u03b22=\u03b12\u2212p\u20322x2(2.88)\nfor incoming (outgoing) spectator of mass m1(m3) and exchanged mass mu. The color coding to the right in Fig. 9\nindicates from which p\u2032of the SMC the solutions p\u00b1(p\u2032,cos\u03b8)originate, while the brown points arise analogously from\nthe pre-factor Ep+p\u2032=0in the B-term. The chosen kinematics corresponds to pion spectators in incoming and outgoing\nstates together with pion exchange. The figure demonstrates that the integration along \u0393Mis numerically stable because\nnone of the solutions p\u00b1intersects with \u0393M, which would produce a pole in B. However, the figure also shows that one\ncannot simply add an on-shell point like in the previously discussed case of two stable propagating particles: Indeed,\nthe region of real, on-shell spectator momenta, shown with the blue horizontal line, intersects with the p\u00b1. This is not\na coincidence and cannot be circumvented with a simple modification of \u0393M. Instead, it represents a genuine problem\nrequiring nontrivial solutions discussed in the following.\n2.8.1. Continuation to real momenta and triangle singularities\nTo discuss the problem of continuation of the three-body amplitude to real spectator momenta, consider the case of a\nreal-valued contour \u0393={p\u2223p\u2208[0,\u039b]}. The solutions p\u00b1for this case are shown to the left in Fig. 10, for the unequal-mass\ncase. For small values of p\u2032(inset \u201cPhysical\u201d), the singularities lie on the real axis, but a complex integration contour\nstarting at p=0(blue solid lines in insets) can easily avoid them. For intermediate values of p\u2032(inset \u201ccritical\u201d of Fig. 10),\ncalled \u201ccritical region\u201d in Ref. [113], there is no way for an integration contour to \u201cescape\u201d the closed cut. For p\u2032outside\nof the physical region, p\u2032>pmax, the cut opens again and the integration contour can avoid the three-body singularities\n(inset \u201cUnphysical\u201d).\nThe problem of closed cut structure in the critical region can be solved by analytically continuing the B-term to the\nsecond sheet and an additional path deformation as shown in Fig. 10 to the right, for the process KK\u2217\u2192\u03c0f0as indicated.\nThis method proposed by Cahill and Sloan [152, 153] was also applied recently in Ref. [154], see also Ref. [155]. The\ncaption of Fig. 10 describes the path on first ( \u0393I) and second ( \u0393II) Riemann sheets with smooth transitions between\nthem at PandR. In particular, the logarithmic singularity at Pis exactly canceled in the chosen path which renders\nthis method stable. Note that to perform this contour deformation, one first needs to know the solution on the interval\n0<p<P, which is usually possible because it corresponds to values of p\u2032below the critical region. One can then simply\nuse a complex path as shown in the lower right inset in Fig. 10 to the left. See Ref. [113] for more detailed explanations.\n23\n\n\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0\u03c1+f0(500)/f0(980)\u03c0K\u00afK\u2192\u03c0\u03c0\u00afKK*\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0K+\u2026+\u03c0\u03c02\u03c0\u03c1\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0p\u2032 +P3\u2212pP3\u2212p\u2032 p\u02dcB\u02dcB\u02dcB\u02dc\u03c4pp\u2032 l+\u2026\u02dcT=\u02dcB\u02d8\u0393=\u03c0\u03c1L\u2113DDD{trianglesingularityFigure 11: Upper row: The rescattering series \u02dcTof isobars (double lines) and spectators (single lines) interacting through particle exchanges\n\u02dcB, followed by propagation \u02dc\u03c4. The amplitude \u02dcT(s,p\u2032,p)depends on the total Mandelstam s=P2\n3and the incoming (outgoing) spectator\nmomentum p(p\u2032), while the isobar propagation depends on \u03c3=(P3\u2212p)2, i.e., \u02dc\u03c4(\u03c3(l))for the internal propagation shown. This series forms the\nfinal-state interaction in the production reaction \u02d8\u0393(s,p\u2032)in the lower row. For \u02d8\u0393(s,p\u2032), some coupled channels are indicated that contribute\nto a three-pion final state, as well as the orbital angular momentum Land isobar spin \u2113. Triangle singularities are naturally included in this\nrescattering series as indicated in an example.\nHowever, for certain mass combinations, the lower end of the critical region, p\u2032\nmin, is to the left of P, located at\npP=p\u2212(m1, m3, mu,\u22121) (2.89)\nwith p\u2212from Eq. (2.87), i.e., p\u2032\nmin<pP. In Ref. [155] and in Ref. [156], a path for this case is discussed. It passes right\nthrough the point where both solutions p\u00b1touch each other as shown to the right of point Pin Fig. 10.\nNote also the special kinematics when Pcoincides with the quasi-on-shell momentum pcmfrom Eq. (2.84) of an\nadjacent channel (e.g., KK\u2217(892)) that contains a narrow resonance. At the corresponding\u221as, the exchanged particle,\nthe spectator and the very narrow resonance are all on-shell, leading to a \u201ctriangle singularity\u201d. Unitarized triangle\nsingularities have been investigated in Ref. [157], see also references therein for further information on this kinematic\nphenomenon. Sakthivasan et al. [157] also compare the Cahill and Sloan method with a direct extrapolation of the\namplitude at complex momenta to the real ones through continued fractions. We summarize the findings in Sect. 4.3.\n2.8.2. Production reactions and \u201cdirect inversion\u201d\nThe method by Cahill and Sloan discussed in the previous section is stable and computationally inexpensive. However,\nin the form presented here it only allows for continuation to real momenta of one of the two momenta of Tfor3\u21923\nscattering (either incoming or outgoing). It can still be used in the phenomenologically relevant 2\u21923kinematics of the\nreaction \u03c0Nto\u03c0\u03c0N, though. It can also be used in production reactions in which Tprovides the final-state interaction.\nThe production reaction is referred to as \u02d8\u0393as shown in Fig. 11. It is obtained by multiplying the \u201camputated\u201d production\nreaction \u02dc\u0393Twith the propagator of the final isobar \u02dc\u03c4and its decay \u02d8vj[113], with sums over identical channel indices\nimplied,\n\u02d8\u0393j(s, p\u2032)=\u02d8vj(\u03c3(p\u2032))\u02dc\u03c4jk(\u03c3(p\u2032))[\u02dc\u0393k(s, p\u2032)+Dk(s, p\u2032)]=\u2236\u02d8vj(\u03c3(p\u2032))\u02dc\u03c4jk(\u03c3(p\u2032))\u02dc\u0393T\nk(s, p\u2032) (2.90)\nwith a new quantity \u02dc\u0393Tconsisting of a \u201cdisconnected\u201d part \u02d8v\u02dc\u03c4Dand the rescattering part \u02dc\u0393. The latter fulfills\n\u02dc\u0393T\nj(s, p\u2032)=Dj(s, p\u2032)+\u222b\u039b\n0dq q2\n(2\u03c0)32Eq\u02dcBji(s, p\u2032, q)\u02dc\u03c4ik(\u03c3(q))\u02dc\u0393T\nk(s, q) (2.91)\nfor channels i, j, k, outgoing spectator momenta p\u2032, and exchange process \u02dcBsimilar to the expression given in Eq. (2.81).\nFor simplicity, contact terms are chosen C=0in Ref. [113]. For the \u201ctilde\u201d notation and further details see Sect. 4.2.\nNote also the appearance of a second index in \u03c4owing to the possibility of sub-channel transitions in the isobar itself,\ne.g.,\u03c0\u03c0\u2194K\u00afKas illustrated in Fig. 11 to the lower right.\nOne disadvantage of the contour deformation method by Cahill and Sloan is the dependence of the contour on the\nspectator masses (e.g., the position of point P) which can become complicated in the multichannel case with unequal\nmasses (although this problem was solved in Ref. [157]).\nAn alternative method is discussed in Ref. [153], based on the original reference [158]. We refer to it as direct inversion\n(DI) as compared to the contour deformation method (CD) discussed before. Its advantage is the independence from\n24\n\nFigure 12: Logarithmically divergent regions of the matrix elements of Z(p\u2032,p;E)for the \u03c0\u2206\u2212\u03c0\u2206and\u03c1N\u2212\u03c0\u2206transitions shown in Fig. 4.\nchannel masses. The main idea is that the solution \u02dc\u0393Tis suitably discretized in qby a finite set of real qi\u2208[0,\u039b],\nwhich can be well approximated by an interpolating polynomial connecting the discrete \u02dc\u0393T(qi)(channel index and index\nsomitted),\n\u02dc\u0393T(q)\u2248N\n\u2211\ni=1\u02dc\u0393T(qi)Hi(q), (2.92)\nusing a set of interpolating polynomials Hi, e.g., Lagrange polynomials. Inserting this Ansatz into Eq. (2.91) immediately\nyields that the integral equation decouples into an algebraic equation, with the complicated three-body cut structure\nmoved to integrals. The latter can be evaluated with standard numerical methods that are robust to the presence of\nlogarithmic singularities.\nAlternatively to the use of Lagrange polynomials, one can approximate \u02dc\u0393Tby splines of a given order, which requires\na certain care in choosing appropriate grid points [11].\nIn the ANL-Osaka approach, a crucial point of numerical calculation is how to choose the integration path C, C\u2032and\ngrid points of momentum in Eq. (2.21) and Eq. (2.25). The coupled integral equation is solved by using the matrix\ninversion method in momentum space. In order to calculate observables, the integration paths CandC\u2032are chosen from\nzero to infinity on the real axis without any contour deformation. When only v\u03b2,\u03b1in Eq. (2.22) contributes, the choice\nof the grid points of momentum is well known. Including the on-shell momentum of the two-body Green\u2019s function, the\nintegrand of principal value integral is replaced by adding the subtraction term to obtain smooth momentum dependence\nand stabilize the numerical integration [159]. The particle exchange interaction Z(p\u2032, p;E)has logarithmic singularity\nabove the \u03c0\u03c0Nthree-body breakup threshold. The logarithmically divergent moon-shape region is shown in Fig. 12. The\nimaginary part is non-zero inside the moon-shape region, which corresponds to the on-shell momentum for the two-body\nGreen\u2019s function. The singularity depends on both p\u2032andp, which makes it difficult to solve the integral equation. To\novercome the difficulty, one writes the unknown half-off shell t-matrix in terms of an interpolation function Si(p)and\nchooses appropriate grid points {pi},\nt\u03b2,\u03b1(p, p0;E)=\u2211\niSi(p)t\u03b2,\u03b1(pi, p0;E). (2.93)\nThen, the required integration can be carried out as precisely as necessary using the known function Si(p). Splines are\nchosen as interpolation functions, which depend locally on the grid points and which are known to be less oscillating\ncompared to the polynomial interpolation. Hermitian splines are used that only have the first derivative continuous.\nBoth the first and the second derivatives are continuous for natural splines. Furthermore, the appropriate choice of the\ngrid points is explained in Refs. [11, 160] using the Amado model [161], as an example. As a fast numerical calculation,\none can use a contour Cin the complex momentum plane as will be discussed in Sect. 2.9 to calculate observables for the\ntwo-body final states.\n2.9. Analytic continuation to complex energies\nResonance poles are situated at complex energies E=\u221asand, in sub-channels, at complex sub-energies or invariant\nmasses\u221a\u03c3. Phenomenologically relevant poles are the ones close to the physical axis, situated on the analytically\ncontinued amplitude in the lower\u221ashalf-plane. Technically, the analytic continuation to complex\u221aswith negative\nimaginary part can be achieved, for example, by a complex contour deformation [86, 115, 142, 162, 163] of the integration\n25\n\nFigure 13: Example of Riemann sheets [++++++ ]and[\u2212\u2212\u2212+++ ]with respect to {p\u03c00,n\u03c0+,p\u03b7,\u039bK+,\u03a30K+,\u03a3\u2212K0}meson-baryon two-\nparticle channels. Both Riemann sheets are connected along the real energy axis between p\u03b7and\u039bK+thresholds. The amplitude is taken\nfrom Ref. [39] corresponding to \u03c0Nscattering for I=1/2,JP=1/2\u2212. The poles correspond to the N(1535)and a N(1650)resonances.\nmomentum running inside the loop integrals. Mesonic resonance poles in three-body amplitudes were only extracted\nrecently [135, 142, 164, 165], while the extraction of exited baryon resonance poles, including three-body channels, has\nbeen carried out by various groups since a long time [86, 115]. The first extraction of a mesonic resonance pole, the\na1(1260), from data, with a three-body unitary amplitude, was achieved in Ref. [142], including a quantification of the\nnoticeable effect from the inclusion of particle exchange as required by unitarity. First Lattice-QCD-based determinations\nof pole positions of three-body resonances have also been pioneered recently, for the a1(1260)[164] and the \u03c9(782)[135].\nFor the mesonic amplitude discussed in Secs. 4.1 and 4.2, one can directly follow Ref. [142]. We summarize the main\nideas of that study in the following.\n2.9.1. Analytic structure of the multi-channel scattering amplitude\nThe analytic structure of the scattering amplitude is characterized by resonance/bound state poles and branch points.\nZeros of the amplitude are related to poles [166]; their interplay in the meson-baryon sector has been illustrated in\nRef. [124]. In addition, there can be triangle singularities [148, 167]. In general, each branch point is associated with\none or more cuts. Some branch points and cuts exist in the plane-wave amplitude (right and left-hand cut), but some\ncuts arise only after partial-wave projection, like the circular cut and the short nucleon cut [118]. Resonance poles and\nbranching ratios have been related in Ref. [168].\nThe multi-valuedness of the T-matrix, discussed in the previous section, leads to the concept of single-valued Riemann\nsheets [118] which, together, form the multi-valued Riemann surface. Any measured (experimentally or as a result of\na numerical lattice calculation) values are located on the real energy-axis of the so-called physical sheet, denoted most\ncommonly by [+. . .+]referring to Sgn(Im(qi(s)))in each two-body channel where qiindicates the c.m. momentum in\nchannel iaccording to Eq. (2.84). The physical axis in the Mandelstam variable slies at s+i\u03f5to make it clear that it is\nsituated above the \u201cright-hand cut\u201d. Generalizing this notation, we denote all sheets by the same type of sequence, see,\ne.g., Ref. [1]. Specifically, the unphysical sheet connected to the physical one along the right-hand cut, between the first\nand second threshold, is denoted as [\u2212+. . .+], the one connected to the physical sheet between the second and third\nthreshold by [\u2212\u2212+ . . .+]etc.. An example of Riemann sheets for a meson-baryon system is depicted in Fig. 13.\nThere is a broad N(1535)pole and a narrower N\u2032(1650)pole. Note that the latter is \u201chidden\u201d behind the K\u039b\nthreshold (hence the prime notation). It is a replica of the actual N(1650)resonance pole on the [\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212++ ]sheet (not\nshown). Indeed, poles often repeat on different Riemann sheets. In particular, if the pole residue to a given channel is\nsmall the pole repeats at almost the same complex energy Eon the two sheets corresponding to that channel.\nThe example of the S11partial wave is also illuminating because the other resonance in that partial wave, N(1535), is\nlocated close to the \u03b7Nchannel opening at E\u22481486 MeV , and it couples strongly to that channel. This leads usually to\nan enhancement of threshold cusps [124] as further discussed in Sec. 3.3.6. Another example is the large cusp in the \u039bN\ncross section at the opening of the \u03a3Nchannel which is due to the appearance of an (unstable) \u03a3Nbound state close to\nthe\u03a3Nthreshold [169].\nThe analytic structure of the P11partial wave is discussed in the following to illustrate three-body aspects of the\nanalytic structure. More phenomenological aspects of that partial wave are discussed in Sect. 3.3.7. The P11wave\n26\n\nRe\u00a0EIm\u00a0ESNCLHCCC\u03c0N\u03c0\u03c0N\u03b7NK\u039bK\u03a3\u03c9N\u03c0\u0394\u03c1N\u03c3NNRoperR'N(1710)Figure 14: Analytic structure of the P11partial wave, for complex scattering energies E=\u221as. The circular cut is labeled \u201cCC\u201d, the left-hand\ncut \u201cLHC\u201d. The nucleon is labeled as N. See text for further explanations.\nFigure 15: Left: Riemann sheet of a two-channel system in terms of the uniformization variable z. The subscript of the Riemann sheets denotes\neither the positive or negative complex half plane of the latter. Right: representation of a 3-channel system on a torus. The corresponding\ntwo-body thresholds are denoted by \"th\".\n(JP=1/2+) is particularly interesting because it hosts the nucleon as a bound state. Its analytic structure is displayed in\nFig. 14. Channels of two stable particles ( \u03c0N,\u03b7N, . . .) have branch points (thresholds) on the real-energy axis. Each of\nthese two-body channels is associated with one right-hand cut. The figure also shows the \u03c0\u03c0Nbranch points on the real\naxis and in the complex plane from the \u03c0\u2206,\u03c3N, and \u03c1Nchannels as discussed in Sect. 2.9.3. To search for poles on the\nmost relevant Riemann sheets, the cuts are chosen to be oriented from the threshold openings into the negative imaginary\nE-direction as indicated in the figure. In addition, the figure shows the sub-threshold short nucleon cut (SNC), circular\ncut (CC) and left-hand cut (LHC). The structure of some of these cuts and branch points is discussed in Ref. [118], see\nalso [115].\nThe (green) stars indicate the positions of the physical poles. The nucleon appears as a bound state pole on the first\nRiemann sheet in the amplitude, right on top of the SNC. The gray cross indicates the bare nucleon pole that moves to\nthe physical position after renormalization (see Sect. 2.6.3). There are two Roper poles on different \u03c0\u2206sheets, labeled\nasN(1440)andN\u2032(1440). This two-pole structure is found in several analyses, such as GWU/SAID [170], EBAC [86],\nand JB [53]. It is due to the fact that poles can repeat on different sheets as discussed previously for the case of the\nN(1535)andN(1650). In addition, the proximity of the complex \u03c0\u2206branch point to the resonance poles leads to a\nnon-standard shape of the Roper resonance that is not of the Breit-Wigner type. Another reason for the unusual shape\nis the strong influence of the \u03c3Nchannel. All three particles \u03c0,\u03c0,Nare in relative S-waves for P11. The absence of\nany centrifugal barriers then, indeed, leads to a large inelasticity at low energies, strongly distorting the Roper resonance\nshape. In addition, other resonances ( N(1710)1/2+andN(1750)1/2+) have been reported in some analyses as the figure\nindicates. The role of the N(1710)1/2is further discussed in Sect. 3.3.7.\nRecently, a model-independent approach that incorporates the resonant and threshold behavior was proposed by\nMorimatsu and Yamada [171]. This approach is a tool for a data driven methodology extracting the resonance information\nwithout referring to a specific model. The starting point is that one can unfold the Riemann surface choosing the\nappropriate variable called uniformization variable zin place of energy\u221as(in all other parts of this review, except for\nthis subsection, zstands for\u221asaccording to Eq. (1.1)). For the single channel case, z=p=\u221a\ns\u2212\u03f52/2with threshold\n27\n\nenergy \u03f5. For the two-channel case, the uniformization variable is given as [172, 173],\nz=p1+p2\n\u2206, (2.94)\nwhere pi=\u221a\ns\u2212\u03f52\ni/2,\u03f5i=(mi+m\u2032\ni)and\u2206=\u221a\n\u03f52\n2\u2212\u03f52\n1/2. Fig. 15 shows the Riemann surface of the two-channel case with\nrespect to zwhich represents four sheets [++],[\u2212+],[+\u2212]and[\u2212\u2212]. The red line corresponds to the real scattering energy\u221asand the subscript (\u00b1)indicates the sign of the imaginary part of\u221as. The lower(higher) threshold is at z=i(z=1).\nThe scattering amplitude Aand the S-matrix become a single-valued function of uniformization variable z. The\nmeromorphic function can be expressed by the sum of pole terms and an entire function, which is the Mittag-Leffler(ML)\nexpansion [174\u2013176]. In the uniformized ML expansion approach, the scattering amplitude is expressed as\nA(z)=\u2211\nn=1(cn\nz\u2212zn\u2212c\u2217\nn\nz+z\u2217n). (2.95)\nHere from the symmetry property of the S-matrix, the amplitude is expressed as a sum of the pair of the poles at zn\nand\u2212z\u2217\nn. The symmetry imposes the series to obey the proper threshold behaviors. The method is applied to study\nthe pole properties of the \u039b(1405)[177] from the analysis of the invariant mass distribution of \u03c0\u03a3in the \u03b3p\u2192K+\u03c0\u03a3\nandK\u2212pcross sections. The data are well fitted as seen in Ref. [177] with three pair of poles. The central values\nof the poles are z1=0.524+i0.316(\u221as1=(1.42\u2212i0.048)GeV),z2=1.640\u2212i1.04(\u221as2=(1.428\u2212i0.07)GeV)and\nz3=2.323\u22120.068i(\u221as3=1.51\u2212i0.007GeV). The conjugate poles are at \u2212z\u2217\n1,\u2212z\u2217\n2and\u2212z\u2217\n3. Pole 1 is on the [\u2212+]sheet\njust below the \u00afKNthreshold and pole 2 and 3 are on the [\u2212\u2212]sheet. The broad peak between \u03c0\u03a3and \u00afKNis sufficiently\nexplained by the pair of poles 1+1\u2217.\nThe method is also applied to demonstrate the manifestation of S-matrix poles in the physical amplitude near an\ninelastic threshold [178]. The left panel of Fig. 16 shows six positions, A-F, of a pole near an inelastic two-body threshold.\nThe right panel shows imaginary parts of the pole-pair contribution of the normalized amplitude given as\nf(z;zp, \u03d5p)=\u22121\n\u03c0Im[exp(i\u03d5p)\nz\u2212zp\u2212exp(\u2212i\u03d5p)\nz+z\u2217p]. (2.96)\nThe pole zpis expressed as zp=rpexp(i\u03b8p). The two cases of the phase of the residue, \u03d5p=\u03d50and\u03d5p=\u03d50\u2212\u03c0/2are\nshown. \u03d50is chosen as \u03d50=\u03b8p\u2212\u03c0/2, Arg(zp\u22121)\u2212\u03c0/2and0for[\u2212+],[+\u2212]and[\u2212\u2212]sheet respectively. See Ref. [178]\nfor details. The quantity eis a normalized energy variable given as\ne=s\u2212\u03f52\n1\n\u03f52\n2\u2212\u03f52\n1. (2.97)\nThe transition of the spectrum is continuous as the pole moves from A to F crossing the boundaries of Riemann sheets\nwhen the pole position is sufficiently close to the threshold in the zplane. The pole near the inelastic threshold exists\nirrespective of which Riemann sheet it is on, and the amplitude shows a peak shape. Since there is no essential difference\non the shape of the spectrum, for example B [\u2212+]\u2212, C[+\u2212]+, D[+\u2212]+and E[\u2212\u2212]\u2212, high precision data will be needed to\ndetermine to which Riemann sheet the pole belongs. It is noticed, poles C, D with positive imaginary part of the energy\nare close to the upper threshold, while the conjugate poles are far from the upper threshold in zplane. The argument\nsuggests that the peak near \u00afDD\u2217threshold found in the analysis of the HAL QCD [179, 180] is most likely due to the\nexistence of pole near \u00afDD\u2217threshold.\nThe uniformization variable zitself has been used to analyze the relation between the poles and the shape of the \u039b\u2212N\ncross section [181] and the movement of poles in a two-channel Breit-Wigner formula [84]. An interesting observation of\nRef. [172] is that, for the two-channel case, the minimum number of the set of poles is two at z1andz2and the positions\nof the two poles satisfy \u2223z1z2\u2223=1. Therefore, one of the poles is inside the unit circle of z, i.e., the [+\u2212]or[\u2212+]sheet\nand the other pole is outside the circle on the [\u2212\u2212]sheet. One can also rewrite the Flatt\u00e9 formula [182] in the form of\nEq. (2.95) with two pairs of poles, whose explicit form is given in [178]. In general, the use of the uniformization variable\ncan help understand the pole movement with respect to some internal parameters of the theory such as, e.g., interaction\nstrength or quark mass in Lattice QCD calculations, see Refs. [183\u2013185].\nClearly, one might be intrigued to extend this approach to the three-channel case. For that case, there are eight\nRiemann sheets. Note that the topological structure of the Riemann surface for two channels is equivalent to that of\na sphere, whereas for three-channels it is equivalent to a torus [186], see also a corresponding discussion in Ref. [1].\nThe explicit construction of the uniformization variable and the description of the Riemann surface is for the first time\nprovided in Ref. [187]. It reads\nz=1\n4K(1/\u03b32)sn\u22121(\u03b3, z12,1/\u03b32).

The use of the ML expansion is demonstrated with a simple example of\nnonrelativistic effective field theory with contact interactions for the 0+,\u039b\u039b\u2212N\u039e\u2212\u03a3\u03a3coupled-channel problem.\n2.9.2. Continuation for two-body channels\nAs discussed, resonance poles are situated on the unphysical sheet in the lower\u221as\u2208Chalf plane that is analytically\nconnected to the physical axis [148]. To find resonance poles in\u221asone cannot simply dial in complex energies because\nthe resulting amplitude on the physical sheet has a right-hand unitarity cut along the real\u221asaxis that separates the\nlower\u221ashalf plane from the physical axis at\u221as+i\u03f5. To illustrate this consider the integration path of Eq. (2.57) or\nEq. (2.91).\nFor one channel of two stable particles with masses maandmb, there is a two-body singularity given by Eq. (2.84)\natp=pcmthat has to be avoided in the integration. Complex paths in the lower momentum plane as shown in Fig. 9\nachieve this as\u221asdevelops a negative imaginary part,\u221as\u2192\u221a\ns\u2032. Such a deformation allows to smoothly (\u201canalytically\u201d)\ncontinue into the lower\u221a\ns\u2032plane onto the unphysical sheet, as long as Im\u221asdoes not become too negative making\npcm(\u221as)cross the integration contour. This situation is shown in Fig. 17 to the left. The right-hand side of the figure\nillustrates an alternative: instead of deforming the path for analytic continuation, one can add the residue (given by the\nclosed circle) to the integral of Eqs. (2.57) and proceed with a path along real momenta because the integrations along\nthe vertical direction cancel [115]:\nT\u00b5\u03bd(E, p\u2032, p)=V\u00b5\u03bd(E, p\u2032, p)+\u2211\n\u03ba\u221e\n\u222b\n0dq q2V\u00b5\u03ba(E, p\u2032, q)G\u03ba(E, q)T\u03ba\u03bd(E, q, p)+\u2211\n\u03ba\u03b4G\u03ba,\n\u03b4G\u03ba=\u2212\u03b8(E\u2212m\u03ba\u2212M\u03ba)V\u00b5\u03ba(E, p\u2032, qcm)2\u03c0i qcmE\u03ba(qcm)\u03c9\u03ba(qcm)\nET\u03ba\u03bd(E, qcm, p), (2.101)\nwith Im E<0,qcmfrom Eq. (2.84), on-shell baryon and meson energies E\u03ba(qcm), \u03c9\u03ba(qcm), and the \u03b8function ensuring\nthat the continuation to the second sheet occurs only above the respective thresholds. Equivalently, one can say that\nthis corresponds to rotating the right-hand cuts into the negative imaginary E-direction, see Fig. 14. Adding the residue\nis, of course, equivalent to adding the discontinuity along the real axis.

They contain the \u2206(1232)pole at \u03c3\u2206, the rotated two-body cut (SEC), and the spectator momentum contour (SMC)\nthat avoids the SEC. The branch point at\u221as\u2206occurs when the SMC, mapped to the \u03c3-plane, starts at \u03c3\u2206.\nequation, the residue term can simply be added to GIof Eq.

(2.101) (adapted to possible differences in the normalization of the T-matrix) is often used in\nchiral unitary approaches [39, 124, 183, 188], while contour deformation has the advantage that it can simultaneously\nwork for two- and three-body channels if the path is chosen accordingly. The disadvantage of contour deformation is\nthat the solution is only known along complex momenta on \u0393; this is less relevant when searching for resonance, but one\ncan still add the (now complex) \u201con-shell\u201d point pcmof Eq. (2.84) to a discretized integration scheme as discussed at the\nbeginning of Sect. 2.8. This is required when calculating pole residues related to branching ratios [104].\nAlso, for various channels with different masses, the contour deformation into the lower momentum plane allows to\nanalytically continue the amplitude for all channels at once. In addition, it automatically ensures the continuation to the\nsheet closest to the physical axis in a given segment of\u221asbetween two thresholds (see next section).\n2.9.3. Continuation for three-body channels\nFor three-body channels, the contour deformation method can be generalized by taking into account the additional cuts,\npoles, and branch points from the three-body dynamics [86, 115, 142, 162, 163]. Instead of two stable particles, there is\nnow a stable \u201cspectator\u201d and a two-body sub-amplitude called \u201cisobar\u201d or \"dimer\". That isobar may contain a resonance\n\u2013 in the JBW and ANL-Osaka models, that is the case for the \u03c0\u2206(1232),f0(500)N(usually called \u201c \u03c3N\u2032\u2032), and \u03c1(770)N\nchannels as discussed in Sect. 2.7.2. In case of mesonic amplitudes, the IVU model [113, 129, 130, 143, 189] contains\nthef0(500),f0(980),\u03c1(770),K\u2217\n0(700)(\u201c\u03ba\u201d), and K\u2217(892)resonances (apart from non-resonant, repulsive isobars) as\ndiscussed in Sect. 4.\nIn the following we first discuss the continuation in the JBW approach and then in the ANL-Osaka approach, pointing\nout the similarities even if the variables differ. For complex energies\u221as, the SMC in the JBW approach still has to avoid\n30\n\nFigure 19: Integration contour C. Left: logarithmic singularity of Z(p\u2032,p;E)for fixed p\u2032from [196]. Right: Singularity of G\u03c0\u2206(p;E)from\n[85].\nthe three-body cuts in the exchange diagrams as shown to the right in Fig. 9 which is one constraint on its form. A new\nconstraint arises by inspecting the sub-energy plane \u03c3given by Eq. (2.80). The insets in Fig. 18 show the SMC in the \u03c3\nplane for different\u221asaccording to the approximate location of the insets. The additional constraint for the SMC arises\nfrom the threshold at m\u03c0+MNand the associated right-hand cut that has to be avoided. Sometimes, for example in\nthe JBW model, resonant two-body sub-amplitudes are parametrized with s-channel propagators and self-energies [113],\nsee Sect. 2.7.2. The latter can be evaluated with a selfenergy contour (SEC). In other instances, the isobar amplitude is\nexpressed by the Inverse Amplitude Method [190\u2013192] as in Refs. [129, 143], or by chiral unitary amplitudes [193, 194]\nor simple contact terms as in Ref. [113], that all can generate two-body resonances through the two-body unitarization.\nIn all cases, one chooses the right-hand cut to be rotated into the lower \u03c3half plane as shown because the SMC contour\nstarts at a \u03c3with negative imaginary part if\u221ashas a negative imaginary part. Once both of the discussed constraints\nare fulfilled for the SMC, the amplitude is automatically continued from sheet I to sheet II as indicated in the figure, just\nas in case of two stable particles discussed before.\nThere are two occasions in which the SMC cannot avoid non-analyticities in the \u03c3plane: If\u221as=\u221as\u2206=m\u03c0+\u221a\u03c3\u2206the\nSMC, mapped to the \u03c3variable, starts at the resonance pole at \u03c3\u2206. This induces a branch point at\u221as\u2206and an associated\ncut connecting the amplitude to a new Riemann sheet IIIas indicated in the figure. As one aims at searching for poles\non the sheets most closely connected to the physical axis, one intends to rotate that cut into the negative imaginary\ndirection as shown.\nThe second case occurs when the SMC starts at\u221a\u03c3=m\u03c0+MN. This induces the branch point at\u221as=2m\u03c0+MN\nas expected. Depending on the orbital angular momentum between isobar and spectator, L, and the decay angular\nmomentum of the isobar, \u2113, the barrier factors at the branch points can be calculated [195].\nFor a more technical discussion of analytic continuation see Ref. [113]. For the JBW model an approximation to the\ndiscussed contour deformation method is taken as discussed in Ref. [115]. In short, the amplitude on the unphysical sheet\nIIis evaluated by adding the discontinuity along the righthand cut to sheet I (with the naming as shown in Fig. 18), just\nas it can be done for the case of two stable particles discussed in Sect. 2.9.2. The approximation consists in replacing\nthe momentum-dependent nature of this process (for three-body channels) by choosing approximate on-shell momenta\nassuming the \u03c3,\u03c1and\u2206resonances are stable. The resulting amplitude on sheet II still exhibits the full analytic structure\nwith complex and real branch points discussed before. Ref. [115] contains also suitable prescriptions for integration paths\nto continue to sheet III. In practical terms the poles are searched in the upper\u221asplanes on the corresponding sheet\nwhich is equivalent due to Schwartz\u2019 reflection principle [115].\nIn the ANL-Osaka model, all the right hand cuts in Fig. 14 are parallel to the real axis. Analytic continuation of the\nT-matrix to the unphysical sheet is performed by deforming the integral contour. For stable meson-baryon (MB) channels\nsuch as \u03c0N, \u03b7N, KY , only the potential v\u03b2,\u03b1(p\u2032, p)contributes. For the T-matrix on unphysical sheet, the integration\ncontour Cin Eq. (2.21) is deformed so that the on-shell momentum does not cross Cin a similar way to the left panel of\nFig. 17. For unstable MB such as \u03c0\u2206, \u03c1N, \u03c3N, the contour Cis chosen by taking into account the \u03c0\u03c0Ndiscontinuity of\nZ(p\u2032, p;E)[196, 197] and the singularity of the MB Green\u2019s function (2.24) [85]. For real energy E,Z(p\u2032, p;E)develops\na logarithmic singularity along the real paxis for fixed p\u2032as illustrated with the blue dotted line in the left panel of\nFig. 19. For Ewith negative imaginary part, the singularity moves and becomes the red dotted line, and one can access\nthe T-matrix of the nearest Riemann sheet across the \u03c0\u03c0Ncut by deforming the contour as C, similar to the stable MB\ncase. Since p\u2032is also varying on C, the allowed path Cis similar to the one in right panel of Fig. 9. One has to also\ntake into account the singularity of the Green\u2019s function. As an example, G\u03c0\u2206(p;E)has a pole corresponding \u201don-shell\u201d\nmomentum px(right panel of Fig. 19) given as\nE\u2212\u03c9\u03c0(px)\u2212E\u2206(px)\u2212\u03a3\u2206(px, E)=0. (2.103)\n31\n\nIn the JBW approach, pxcorresponds to the \u2206-pole in the \u03c3variable at \u03c3\u2206, discussed above. The Green\u2019s function\nalso has a discontinuity associated with \u03c0\u03c0Nthrough the self-energy indicated with the dashed line in the right panel of\nFig. 19, that has to be avoided by the contour. Note that the integration contour C\u2032of Eq. (2.25) has to be deformed [85].\nIn the JBW approach, the self-energy contour (SEC) is similarly deformed as indicated in Fig. 18. For unstable MB, the\ncontour Cis determined by the singularity of Z(p\u2032, p;E)andGMB(p;E)simultaneously.\n2.10. Related approaches and aspects\nThe challenge to construct coupled-channel scattering amplitudes from general properties of the scattering S-matrix has\nreceived much interest in recent years as reviewed, e.g., by Oller [198], JPAC [199] and, and Mai et al. [1]. In the\nfollowing we discuss a particular approaches related to the previously introduced DCC models and point out similarities\nand differences.\n2.10.1. The Bethe-Salpeter equation in coupled channels\nWe start the discussion with the general Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) from which most DCC approaches arise through\ndifferent schemes for three-dimensional reductions as discussed in Sec. 2.7.1.\nIn the following we sketch a coupled-channel, chiral unitary formalism (UCHPT) which is related to DCC approaches\nbut relies on chiral Lagrangians and is notreduced to three dimensions. Various versions of UCHPT formalisms exist\nwhich differ in the form and iteration prescription of the chiral potential, for a review see [200]. Here we demonstrate the\nmethodology [38, 39, 201] which is most closely related to an expansion in Feynman diagrams allowing, e.g., for extensions\nof the approach to manifestly gauge-invariant photoproduction amplitudes [38, 42, 202].\nThe formalism relies on the fully covariant BSE [203]. We denote the in- and outgoing meson momenta by q1andq2,\nand the overall four-momentum by p=q1+p1=q2+p2, where p1andp2are the momenta of in- and out-going baryon,\nrespectively. For the meson-baryon scattering amplitude T(/q2,/q1;p)and chiral kernel V(/q2,/q1;p)the integral equation\nto solve reads\nT(/q2,/q1;p)=V(/q2,/q1;p)+i\u222bddl\n(2\u03c0)dV(/q2,/l;p)S(/p\u2212/l)\u2206(l)T(/l,/q1;p), (2.104)\nwhere Sand\u2206represent the baryon (of mass m) and the meson (of mass M) propagator respectively, that are given\nbyiS(/p)=i/(/p\u2212m+i\u03f5)andi\u2206(k)=i/(k2\u2212M2+i\u03f5). Note that, in contrast to the rest of this review and more in line\nwith baryon CHPT, baryon (mesons) masses are indicated with lowercase m(capitalized M) in this subsection. The\nsuppressed channel indices in the above formulas include all relevant (meson-baryon) coupled channels, such that T,V,\nSand\u2206are matrices in channel space. For strangeness S=0and electric charge Q=+1one is left with the following\nchannels: {p\u03c00, n\u03c0+, p\u03b7, \u039bK+,\u03a30K+,\u03a3+K0}.\nThe interaction kernel to be iterated in Eq. (2.104) includes only the contact-term contributions from leading and\nnext to leading order (NLO) chiral Lagrangians. Baryon exchange diagrams (Born terms) are omitted in this approach\nfor technical reasons. Clearly, this is a limitation of the approach, rooted in the fact that Born terms are required by\nthree-body unitarity, see Sect. 2.7.1. Still, this procedure provides the only way to treat chiral NLO corrections in the\ncovariant BSE, without making use of the on-shell approximation or S-wave projection of the chiral potential, so that also\naP-wave can be iterated. Separating the momentum space from channel space structures the chiral potential considered\nhere takes the

in the appendix of Refs. [42, 202]. The loop diagrams appearing\nin the BSE Eq. (2.104) are in general divergent and require renormalization. In case of a strict chiral perturbation\nexpansion, the terms can be renormalized in a quite straightforward way, order by order, including, at a given order, all\nthe counterterms absorbing the loop divergencies. On the other hand, the treatment of the divergencies of the BSE is\nknown to be a complicated issue, see, e.g., Refs. [38, 204] which is why here the loops are regularized by treating the\nregularization scale as a fitting parameter.\nFinally, to solve the BSE one embraces the fact that the invariant Dirac-structures of Eq. (2.105) induce a closed\nset (under iterations) of Dirac-structures. Thus, the iteration through the BSE can be solved exactly embedding the\nT-matrix in the latter space as\nT(/q2,/q1;p)=20\n\u2211\ni=1\u2135i\u22c5Ti, V(/q2,/q1;p)=20\n\u2211\ni=1\u2135i\u22c5Vi, (2.106)\n32\n\nwhere the coefficients TiandViare6\u00d76matrices in channel space, which only depend on the c.m. energy\u221asafter fixing\nthe low-energy constants, and \u2135\u2236=(/q1,/p/q1,/q2/p/q1,/q2/q1,/p/q1(q2\u22c5p),/q1(q2\u22c5p),/q2(q1\u22c5p),/q2/q1,(q1\u22c5p)(q2\u22c5p),/p(q1\u22c5p)(q2\u22c5p),\n(q1\u22c5p),/p(q1\u22c5p),(q2\u22c5q1),/p(q2\u22c5q1),/q2/p,/q2,/p(q2\u22c5p),(q2\u22c5p),1,/p)is a vector in the 20\u2013dimensional space of invariant\nstructures. Note that the scalar products are listed here as independent structures because we include the full off-shell\ndependence of the chiral potential in the BSE, which prevents us from writing them as simple functions of the Mandelstam\nvariables sandt. Reinserting now the latter decomposition into the BSE (2.104) and collecting all Ti(s)on the r.h.s.\none obtains the following expression\n20\n\u2211\ni=1Vi\u2135i(q2, q1;p)=20\n\u2211\ni=1(\u2135i(q2, q1;p)\u221220\n\u2211\nj=1Vj(i\u222bddl\n(2\u03c0)d\u2135j(q2, l;p)(/p\u2212/l+m)\u2135i(l, q1;p)\n(l2\u2212M2+i\u03f5)((p\u2212l)2\u2212m2+i\u03f5)))Ti(s),(2.107)\nwhere Vis expressed as coefficients of the vector elements of \u2135.

In fact,\nthe latter expression is a system of 20coupled linear equations which we can rewrite in an even more elegant way as\nXj\niTj(s)=Vi, (2.109)\nwhere we have utilized the Einstein summation convention for i, j\u2208[1,20]andX\u2208Mat20\u00d720, whereas each element is a\ncomplex valued channel space matrix defined by Xij=(\u03b4ij\u2212\u02dcCij).\nIf one is interested in scattering quantities, one can solve equation (2.109) for all 20 structures reducing them in the\nfinal step to two on-shell structures {/p,1}, c.f., Eq. (2.52), ultimately reducing to partial-wave amplitudes etc. [42]. In\nSect. 3.3.6 we discuss such an application.\n2.10.2. Statistical aspects and machine learning tools\nThe interpretation of near-threshold enhancement phenomena is one of the central issues of resonance searches. Common\nprocedures, sometimes referred to as top-to-bottom approaches, start from a model such as UCHPT, or DCC which\ninclude symmetry assumptions. Then, comparing the model to the data or fitting free parameters and performing analytic\ncontinuation to complex energies, resonance parameters are extracted, see Sect. 2.9.1 or Ref. [205] for an introductory\nand historical review. Alternatively, one can ask if observed line shapes actually encode some information about the\nnature of the enhancement inducing resonances as, e.g., virtual, resonance, or bound states. Recently, there has been\nnotable progress in this direction, sometimes referred to as bottom-to-top approaches, often relying on the development\nof machine learning tools. The general workflow is that minimal assumptions are made for the form of the amplitude\nproducing a large set of synthetic data, being variations of line shapes with known resonance pole class, training a neural\nnetwork. A trained network can recognize pattern in the line shapes associated with the pole category. It is then applied\nto the real experimental data providing probabilities for the presence of a resonance, bound states, etc..\nA program utilizing deep neural networks (DNN) was carried out in Ref. [206]. There, a deep feed-forward neural\nnetwork (for a schematic representation of the latter see Fig. 20) in classifying objects was utilized and shown to have\nhigh level of accuracy ( >90%) which however can drop with sizable background effects. DNN were also explored by\nJPAC [208]. In this proof of concept study, a neural network was trained on a synthetic data set containing 105line\nshapes produced with a generic form of an amplitude for J/\u03c8\u2212pscattering. Each of these line shapes was labeled by\nthe characteristics of the pole being a virtual or bound state, and the corresponding Riemann sheets. Through this\n(including the necessary validation procedures), the DNN learned how the nature of the state is related to the details\nof the pertinent line shape. Applying this so-called DNN classifier to the experimental data one can, indeed, obtain\na probability for the nature of the state as favored by the data. This was done for the LHCb data for the Pc(4312)\nsignal, leading to a virtual state interpretation favored also by the previous traditional amplitude study [209]. Studies\nof coupled-channel effects within DNN-type approaches can be found in Refs. [210], see also Refs. [211\u2013213] for further\n33\n\n1500 2000 2500 3000 3500100200300400500\nM[MeV]\u0393[MeV]Figure 20: Left: Schematic picture of a deep neural network for S-matrix pole classification.

Figure adapted from Ref. [207].\napplications and Ref. [214] for an example of how detector effects can be removed from the identification of multi-particle\nfinal states. Related approaches [215, 216] aim at distinguishing kinematic triangle singularities (see Sect. 2.8.1) from\ngenuine resonance effects. For related reviews see Refs. [199, 217].\nIn the context of spectroscopy, there are various \u201cblindfolded\u201d ways to test new resonances, without the need of manual\nintervention. These methods are robust in the sense that they allow for a relative model comparison even if the overall\n\u03c72is not excellent. Bayesian inference to determine the resonance spectrum was introduced into baryon spectroscopy by\nthe Ghent group [218, 219]. In a related context, the necessary precision of data to discriminate models was determined\nin Ref. [220]. Another method for the partial-wave analysis of mesonic systems was presented in Ref. [221], see also\nRef. [222]. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) allows one to generate a series of models\nwith varying partial-wave content, for an application at COMPASS, see Ref. [223]. Ideally, LASSO tests all combinations\nof partial waves for all numbers of partial waves. Realistically, this is not achieved as fits are usually nonlinear, have\ndifferent local minima etc. The non-convexity of the problem tied to this has been recently addressed in Ref. [224] in\nconnection with ways to make pole searches in partial waves more efficient. The best model among all the ones generated\nby LASSO can then be selected in an additional step through cross validation or various criteria from information theory\n(BIC, AIC,...) [225, 226].\nSpecifically, in Ref. [207] the procedure was applied to the \u00afKN\u2192K\u039eworld data base, including polarized and\nunpolarized differential cross sections, to determine the minimally needed set of resonances to describe the data. For\nphotoproduction data in Ref. [227], minimal models compatible with data were automatically identified with the same\ntechnique, minimizing the number of significant partial waves and the number of parameters within the nonzero waves.\nThe basic idea is to provide a very flexible model based on general properties of scattering theory allowing for a very\nlarge number of resonances, but penalizing overfitting data fluctuations through unphysical resonances. Several scenarios\nare also tested on synthetic data providing more certainty in these novel techniques. As an example, in one of the\napproaches [207] the penalty procedure smoothly \u201cpushed\u201d the resonances not necessarily demanded by the data, out of\nthe relevant mass/width window as depicted in the right panel of Fig. 20. Related forms of penalty functions are utilized\nin Refs. [228, 229] in combination with LASSO, Ridge regression and other methods for kaon photoproduction reactions.\nIn Ref. [230] Genetic Algorithms (evolution inspired update framework) are applied within a realistic Lagrangian model of\nthe pion photoproduction reaction. This may, indeed, have an advantage over traditional \u03c72minimization methodology\nwhen multiple local minima are present.\nOn a more general footing, machine learning tools aim at replacing microscopic models by data driven methods\nextracting some fundamental characteristics of underlying dynamics. Clearly, this procedure is very much sensitive to the\nquality and quantity of data, and it suffers under possible systematic uncertainties in the data. An example of possible\npitfalls is given in Ref. [231] using kaon photoproduction data with a \u039b-baryon in the final state. In this regard, the\nfamous d\u2019Agostini bias is worth mentioning, which systematically favors smaller model values when a normalization error\nin the experimental data is implemented in the naive way [232]. See also Ref. [233] in which a way is discussed to avoid\nbias when fitting multiple normalization constants from different experiments.\nAs a forward-looking perspective for necessary development we emphasize that besides controlled systematics \u2013such as\nchoiceofarchitecture\u2013amajorchallengeisthequestionofhowtoincludesymmetriesinmachinelearningapproaches. The\nuseofobservedsymmetriesis, indeed, whathelpedparticlephysicstoachieveahighlevelofpredictabilityinthefirstplace.\nIn DCC models this is addressed through implementation of phenomenological Lagrangians. In some idealized physics\n34\n\nproblems neural networks can indeed learn symmetries by themselves [234, 235]. Still the question is how to implement\nthis in a more data-sparse, realistic scenario for the example of meson-photoproduction off the nucleon discussed in this\nreview. Perhaps one practical approach is to \u201cbake-in\u201d the symmetries directly into the architecture [236, 237] possibly\nby utilizing existing techniques of DCC models.\n2.11. Finite-volume extensions\n2.11.1. Two-body quantization condition and L\u00fcscher formula\nLattice QCD provides information about the spectrum, structure, and interactions of hadrons as they emerge from quark-\ngluondynamics. ThisnumericalapproachreliesonMonte-CarlosamplingofcorrelationfunctionsonEuclideanspace-time\nevaluated in a finite (space-time) volume. Due to this, real-time observables such as scattering amplitudes cannot be\naccessed directly. Instead, as pioneered by L\u00fcscher for two-body systems [238\u2013240], the dependence of energy eigenvalues\non the volume size can be used to single out dynamics of the system for not too small volumes. In this section, we briefly\nmotivate the L\u00fcscher method suitable for two-body systems and discuss how it is related to DCC approaches. Then we\nshow the connection between DCC models and the Finite-Volume Unitarity (FVU) approach for three-body systems. For\nspecialized reviews on the topic see Refs. [1, 6, 241, 242].\nLattice QCD calculations are performed in a finite volume because of the finiteness of computational resources. This\nnecessitates the need for boundary conditions, for simplicity most frequently periodic boundary conditions are chosen\nequating wave functions \u03c8(x)=\u03c8(x+L)in each space dimension. The system, therefore, exhibits a discrete set of real\nenergy eigenvalues. An equation which maps the latter to complex-valued infinite-volume scattering amplitudes is referred\nto asquantization condition .\nTo illustrate this in an example of two-to-two scattering, we follow the simplified derivation of Ref. [243]. Consider\ntwo stable scalar particles interacting through some potential Vprojected to the S-wave. Suppressing for the following\ndiscussion the momentum dependence of the potential, V=V(E2), the scattering amplitude can be obtained as a solution\nof the scattering equation,\nT=V+V GT=1\nV\u22121\u2212Gfor G=\u2223q\u2223<qmax\n\u222bd3q\n(2\u03c0)31\n2\u03c91(q)\u03c92(q)\u03c91(q)+\u03c92(q)\nE2\u2212(\u03c91(q)+\u03c92(q))2+i\u03f5, (2.110)\nfor total energy Eand particle masses m1, m2with corresponding energies \u03c91,2(q)=\u221a\nm2\n1,2+q2. Here the two-particle\nloop integral is regularized with some sharp cutoff qmax. We note that the loop function Gis a relativistic form of the\nintegral over the non-relativistic Green\u2019s function 1/(E\u2212H0)and thus T\u223c1/(E\u2212H). The imaginary part of the loop\nfunction is given by ImG=\u2212qcm/(8\u03c0\u221as)with qcmfrom Eq. (2.84). This amplitude fulfills two-body unitarity and can\nbe written in terms of the phase-shift as\nT=\u22128\u03c0E\nqcmcot\u03b4\u2212iqcmfor qcmcot\u03b4=\u22128\u03c0E(V\u22121\u2212ReG). (2.111)\nConsider now the same system in a finite volume or, more specifically, a 3-dimensional cube with side length Lwith\nperiodic boundary conditions. In that system momenta become discretized, i.e., q\u2208R3\u2192q\u2208\u2135L\u2236={(2\u03c0/L)n\u2223n\u2208Z3}\nsuch that the loop function in Eq.

(2.112)\nNote that \u02dcGis a real but singular function, with poles emerging whenever the on-shell condition E=\u03c91(q)+\u03c92(q)is\nfulfilled for any q\u2208\u2135L. Furthermore, the above equation explicitly provides the volume dependence of \u02dcG. In contrast to\nthe Green\u2019s function G, the interaction Vdoes not contain any configurations in which the two-particle system is on-shell,\ni.e.,V\u2208Rin the physical region. In fact, this is a prerequisite for two-body unitarity. Therefore, the infinite-volume\ninteraction equals the finite-volume interaction, V\u2248\u02dcVup to small contributions. One can think of Vcontaining, e.g.,\ntadpole loops for which the integration is replaced by a summation in finite volume, or t-channel exchange of off-shell\nparticles. In contrast to G, these off-shell terms do not exhibit poles in the physical region; the sum that replaces the\nintegral, therefore, approximates the integral well. The differences are exponentially suppressed according to the regular\nsummation theorem, \u223ce\u2212MLwhere Mis the characteristic energy scale of the problem, e.g., the pion mass.\nWith this information we can use the finite-volume loop function \u02dcGto define a finite-volume quantity \u02dcT\nT\u2192\u02dcT=\u22128\u03c0E\nqcmcot\u03b4\u2212(\u22128\u03c0E)GLwith GL=\u02dcG\u2212ReG , (2.113)\n35\n\nwith a real-valued, volume-dependent function GL. Just like in the infinite volume, the discrete energy eigenstates {EL}\nof the Hamiltonian correspond to poles of \u02dcT\u223c1/(E\u2212H)except for the modified boundary conditions. Consequently, for\nan energy eigenvalue E\u2217the phase shift at this energy is obtained as\nqcm(E\u2217)cot\u03b4\n\u231f\u27eap\u27e8rro\u27ea\u231f\u27e8rro\u27eamo\u27e8\u231f\u27e8rro\u27eamo\u27e8\u231f\u27e8rro\u27eamo\u27e8\u231f\u27e8rro\u27eamo\u27e8\u231f\u27e8o\u27ean\u27e8rro\u27ea\nExperiment\nEffective Field Theories\n...(E\u2217)=(\u22128\u03c0E\u2217)GL(E\u2217)forE\u2217\u2208{EL}\n\u231f\u27eap\u27e8rro\u27ea\u231f\u27e8rro\u27eamo\u27e8\u231f\u27e8rro\u27eamo\u27e8\u231f\u27e8rro\u27eamo\u27e8\u231f\u27e8rro\u27eamo\u27e8\u231f\u27e8o\u27ean\u27e8rro\u27ea\nlattice QCD(2.114)\nand\u02c6q=qcm(E\u2217)L/(2\u03c0).

[243, 244] for an explicit derivation. The quantization condition (2.114) allows one to either predict the finite\nvolume spectrum provided knowledge of the phase shift (e.g., from experiment or an effective theory), or, given a set\nof eigenenergies {EL}determined by lattice QCD, to calculate a set of phase shifts at these energies as schematically\nindicated by the arrows in Eq. (2.114). Note that there is no ultraviolet divergence for GLasqmax\u2192\u221e. If one operates\nwithanexplicitcutoffregularizationtheintegrand/summandisusuallysmoothenedtomakethecutoffeffectexponentially\nsuppressed with the volume [243].\nThe present discussion skips the special role of the angular momenta leading in the finite volume to the decomposition\ninto irreducible representations of the cubic group, and we also skip extensions to multichannel systems. For more details\non this we refer the reader to Refs. [243, 245\u2013252]. The key takeaway point of the above discussion is, however, that\nunitarity identifies all on-shell configurations of two particles which then allows one to single out volume independent\nterms connecting quantities accessible on the lattice and the infinite volume/experiment. This methodology is also at\nthe core of the FVU approach in deriving the three-body quantization condition proposed in Ref. [253] and described in\nSect. 2.11.3.\n2.11.2. DCC approaches for two-body systems in finite volume\nBefore turning to three-body systems we summarize the findings of Ref. [254] on DCC approaches in the finite volume.\nThis is closely related to the previous introductory discussion in that it also relies on explicit two-body unitarity. In\naddition, we discuss different boundary conditions and higher angular momentum potentials. Starting with the partial-\nwave projected DCC equation in the meson-baryon normalization (2.57) and replacing the integral with a sum as in\nEq. (2.112), one obtains the scattering equation in discretized momentum space,\nT(BC)(E, p\u2032, p)=V(E, p\u2032, p)+2\u03c02\nL3\u221e\n\u2211\ni=0\u03d1(BC)(i)V(E, p\u2032, qi)T(BC)(E, qi, p)\u221as\u2212E(qi)\u2212\u03c9(qi), q i=fBC(i), (2.116)\nwhere qiis the distance from the origin to the i-th neighbors, called \u201cshell\u201d, depending on the imposed boundary conditions\n(BC). All quantities in this equation are real and the potential Vautomatically contains the correct threshold behavior\ndue to its partial-wave projection. The \u03d1(BC)are the BC-dependent multiplicities counting the number of lattice points on\nshell i+1. In comparison to Eq. (2.57), the integration measure is replaced as dqq2\u21922\u03c02\u03d1(P)(i)/L3in the finite volume.\nFor periodic (P) boundary conditions, the \u03d1(P)series (1,6,12,...) is given by the coefficients of the Taylor expansion\naround x=0of the function g(P)(x)=[\u03d13(0, x)]3,\ng(P)(x)=\u221e\n\u2211\ni=0\u03d1(P)(i)xi,where \u03d13(0, x)=\u221e\n\u2211\nk=\u2212\u221exk2, (2.117)\ndenoting the elliptic \u03d1function [255]. The distance to shell iis simply fP(i)=2\u03c0\u221a\ni/L. Another choice is given\nby antiperiodic (A) boundary conditions [243]. In that case, the multiplicities, \u03d1(A)=8,24,24, . . .are given by the\ncoefficients of the Taylor expansion [cf. Eq. (2.117)] around x=0of the function g(A)(x)=[\u03d12(0,\u221ax)]3x\u22123/8, where \u03d12\nis the elliptic \u03d1function [255]\n\u03d12(0,\u221ax)=2x1/8\u221e\n\u2211\nk=0xk(k+1)/2, (2.118)\nand the distance from origin to shell iis now given as fA(i)=2\u03c0\nL\u221a\n8i+3\n4with i=0,1, . . ., provided that the origin is now\nin the center of a momentum cell and no longer at the edge as for periodic BC.\n36\n\n2 2.5 3 3.5\nL [M\u03c0-1]13001400150016001700E [MeV]\n1234\n056\n2 2.5 3 3.5\nL [M\u03c0-1]8009001000110012001300E [MeV]\n234Figure 21: Left: Spectrum E(L)of the I=0, S=\u22121,JP=1\n2\u2212meson-baryon sector [ \u039b(1405)] for periodic boundary conditions in the G1u(0)\nirrep.

For comparison,\nthe result with anti-periodic boundary conditions for the chiral unitary approach of Ref. [193] is shown with thick dash-dotted lines. Also, the\nresult with periodic boundary conditions in the A+\n1irrep is shown (dashed lines). Dotted (thin dash-dotted) lines: free \u03c0\u03c0(free anti-periodic\n\u00afKK)levels.\nComparing Eq. (2.116) and Eq. (2.113) we note that the former allows for explicit momentum dependence in Vwhile\nthe latter does not, rendering the scattering equation algebraic. In fact, if Vis derived from a Langrangian, its momentum\nis replaced by the on-shell momentum, p\u2192pcmfor this purpose. We conclude that this replacement of putting momenta\non-shell changes both the amplitude in the infinite volume and the energy spectrum in the finite volume. However,\nthe difference between both formalisms, when it comes to mapping between finite and infinite volume, is exponentially\nsuppressed as the approaches coincide on-shell. As exponentially suppressed contributions are model-dependent, anyway,\nthere is no advantage of one formalism over the other. An exception is the case of a close-by left-hand cut. Such\nstructures can be built explicitly into DCC approaches with their full momentum dependence. See Refs. [256\u2013258] for\nrelated approaches.\nTechnically, the solution of Eq. (2.116) proceeds just like the solution of the infinite-volume scattering equation (2.57)\nby discretization as explained in Sect. 2.8. In fact, the only difference lies in the distribution of sample points and\nintegration weights, that are replaced by multiplicities.\nNotealsothatthesituationradicallychangeswhenconsideringthree-bodysystemsdiscussedinSect.2.11.3. Then, the\nmomentum dependence of Vis compulsory due to three-body unitarity, and there is a whole range of on-shell momenta.\nIn that case, the scattering equation can never be recast as a geometric series and remains a true integral equation. As a\nlast remark, the determination of the two-body finite-volume spectrum from a Hamiltonian discussed here resembles the\neffective Hamiltonian approach for the same purpose [259\u2013262].\nIn the following, two predictions from Ref. [254] of the finite-volume spectrum from existing DCC approaches are\npresented, for the \u039b(1405)(baryonic) and for the f0(500)(mesonic) quantum numbers and the respective irreps G1u(0)\nandA+\n1. For the \u039b(1405)and the f0several lattice QCD collaborations have produced data and finite-volume analyses\nleadingtothefirstdeterminationsoftherespectiveresonancepolesfromQCD,seeRefs.[184,260,263\u2013268]andRefs.[185,\n251, 269\u2013275], respectively.\nTo produce the finite-volume spectra in the I=0, S=\u22121meson-baryon sector shown to the left in Fig. 21, the\ndynamical coupled-channel model of Refs. [16, 276] is considered. It includes the channels \u03c0\u039b,\u03c0\u03a3, and \u00afKN. The\nattraction in coupled channels is so strong that the \u039b(1405)appears dynamically generated. In this approach, also\nthe channels \u00afK\u2206,\u00afK\u2217N, and \u00afK\u2217\u2206are included. However, these channels contribute only effectively to the direct \u00afKN\ninteraction in form of box diagrams [16]. Below the three-body thresholds, these channels are physically closed, the box\ndiagrams are real, and one can refrain from explicitly discretizing the integrals related to these box diagrams; the three-\nbody system is more intricate, anyway, as outlined below. The level structure below the \u00afKNthreshold is interesting\nbecause of a conjectured two-pole structure of the \u039b(1405)[280, 281]. Indeed, also the hadron-exchange approach of\nRef. [16], considered here, predicts two poles below the \u00afKNthreshold [276]. The two different approaches both predict\nan attractive \u03c0\u03a3threshold level (level 0) and another level close to but below the \u00afKNthreshold (level 1). The non-\ninteracting threshold levels are given by the horizontal lines. Note that while both amplitudes contain two \u039b(1405)poles,\n37\n\nthe latter are not manifested in additional energy eigenvalues.\nFor the scalar-isoscalar finite-volume spectrum shown to the right in Fig. 21, the interaction potential developed in\nRefs. [278, 279] is used for which the coupling between the \u03c0\u03c0(or\u03c0\u03b7) and \u00afKKchannels is taken into account. The\n\u03c3\u2261f0(500),f0(980), and a0(980)resonances all appear dynamically generated, i.e., without the need of corresponding\ns-channel exchanges. On the other hand, the model does include also a genuine resonance in form of an s-channel pole\ndiagram, tentatively called f0(1400)in Ref. [278], whose bare mass is at 1520 MeV . The finite-volume spectrum exhibits\na characteristic avoided level crossing at around 980 MeV shown with the dashed lines. In general, avoided level crossing\nis not only a signal for a resonance but also for S-wave thresholds. Here the f0(980)coincides with the K\u00afKthreshold,\nmaking it difficult to disentangle both effects. It is, therefore, useful to modify the BC to obtained more information on\nthe system. Using the multiplicities \u03d1Aand shell radii fAquoted above, the resulting energy eigenvalues are shown with\nthe thick red solid lines. Indeed, the avoided level crossing disappears with anti-periodic BC [243, 282].\nTo conclude this part, it should be mentioned that chiral unitary approaches in which the full, four-dimensional\nBSE (2.104) is solved, can also be matched to the finite volume, allowing for predictions or data analyses. This has been\ndemonstrated in Ref. [283]: For various coupled channels, extensions to twisted boundary conditions, and different hadron\nmasses, the spectrum of the N(1535)andN(1650)was predicted.\n2.11.3. Connection of DCC approaches to three-body finite-volume systems\nSince a few years, it has become possible to calculate three-body systems from LQCD due to two closely intertwined\nfactors. First, increased computational capacities and algorithmic developments have made the implementation of multi-\nhadron operators possible, see Refs. [135, 138, 140, 143, 164, 284\u2013295] for recent studies including lattice calculations.\nSuch programs provide a discrete finite-volume energy spectrum, which encodes the full QCD dynamics. Relating this\nspectrum to the infinite-volume (coupled-channel) amplitude is accomplished by the previously introduced Quantization\nConditions(QCs). SeeRefs.[241,242]fordedicatedreviewsinthethree-hadronsectorandRef.[164]forafirstapplication\nto a three-body resonance using two channels. As mentioned in Sect. 4, there are also recent extensions to unequal masses\nand coupled channels [138, 290, 296] in the context of an alternative approach.\nHere,wediscusstheconnectionofthree-bodyquantizationconditionsinformoftheFVUapproachtoDCCapproaches.\nTheinfinite-volumeaspectofthree-bodyunitarity(IVU)[130]isreviewedinSect.2.7.1. TheFVUapproachwasdeveloped\nin Ref. [253]. Following these works, the three-body scattering amplitude of identical spinless particles, \u03a6\u03a6\u03a6\u2192\u03a6\u03a6\u03a6, is\ngiven by Eq. (2.79) as the sum of a connected piece and a once-disconnected piece. The connected piece contains the\nthree-dimensional isobar-spectator re-scattering piece Tthat obeys Eq. (2.83), which resembles a Lippmann-Schwinger\nequation with relativistic kinematics. The re-arrangement interaction Bis complex-valued as demanded by unitarity and\ngiven in Eq. (2.81). Together with a real-valued term Cthey determine the dynamics of the three-body scattering.\nThe two-body Green\u2019s function is given in Eq. (2.82).

(2.119)\nThe normalization constants (N2, N3)address possible isospin or other combinatorial coefficients while vcarries angular\ndependence of the isobar decaying to the asymptotically stable final states. Neither of these have free parameters which\ncan all be absorbed into the remaining unspecified real-valued terms C,\u02dcK. Since \u03c4is proportional to the two-body\nscattering amplitude \u03a6\u03a6\u2192\u03a6\u03a6up to angular factors, one can, indeed, exactly relate \u02dcK\u223cqcmcot\u03b4\u03d5\u03d5\u2192\u03d5\u03d5. Similarly, one\ncould hope to identify also Cwith some sort of three-body K-matrix, see, e.g., Refs. [297]. However, this is in general\nnot possible since any three-body observables can only be obtained from the knowledge of the C-term via the integral\nequation (2.83) plugged into Eq. (2.79). Thus, this relation will always depend on the details of the integration like\ncutoff-dependence, which, for example, leads to a cycling behavior of this three-body force becoming infinite at specific\nchoices of the cutoff [147, 298, 299]. Therefore, this term has more analogy with a coupling constant than a K-matrix.\nIn view of the relation between the finite-volume spectrum accessible in lattice QCD calculations and observables such\nas line shapes or Dalitz plots, the key point of identifying on-shell configurations is accomplished by invoking unitarity,\nleadingtoon-shellconfigurationsnotonlyintheisobar-spectatorpropagationbutalsointheparticleexchangeinteraction.\nThis enables one to follow the same steps as used in deriving the two-body quantization condition Eq. (2.114) and replace\nall (intermediate) momenta as q\u2208R\u2192q\u2208\u2135L\u2236={(2\u03c0/L)n\u2223n\u2208Z3}. In the denominator of Eq. (2.119) this induces a\nsum over relative momenta in the two-body subsystem ( \u03a3\u2192\u02dc\u03a3) similarly to Eq. (2.112). This transforms the integral\nequation Eq. (2.83) to a real-valued matrix equation with singularities located at the eigen-energies (set {EL\n3}) of the\nHamiltonian in the finite volume borrowing the same logic as the one used to derive two-body quantization condition\nbefore. Overall, and noting that for any matrix the singularities are given by the zeros of the determinant, we obtain the\n38\n\nFVU three-body quantization condition\ndet[(\u02dcK\u22121\n\u231f\u27eap\u27e8rro\u27ea\u231f\u27e8rro\u27eamo\u27e8\u231f\u27e8rro\u27eamo\u27e8\u231f\u27e8rro\u27eamo\u27e8\u231f\u27e8rro\u27eamo\u27e8\u231f\u27e8o\u27ean\u27e8rro\u27ea\n2-body input\nEq.

This is an infinite-dimensional\nspace\u2135Lsince the spectator can take on any of these momenta. Similarly to Eq. (2.114), we ignore here the angular\nmomentum decomposition and the corresponding decomposition into the irreducible representations of the cubic group in\nthe finite volume. In any case, the methodology of relating lattice determined energy eigenvalues to observable scattering\nquantities is here not one-to-one one as in Eq. (2.114). Instead, the energy eigenvalues determine the roots of the above\nequation, thus, constraining the volume-independent quantities Cand \u02dcK. In fact, Cis fit to the three-body energies EL\n3,\nwhile input from the two-body lattice QCD system enters through \u02dcK. It is only in the second step, by putting these\nquantities in the corresponding infinite-volume scattering equation, that the experimentally accessible quantities (line\nshapes, Dalitz plots, pole positions) can be retrieved as indicated in Eq. (2.120). This is of course valid for all currently\navailable and employed approaches to the three-body quantization condition [147, 253, 297].\nThe discussion above serves as an anchor point relating methods central to this review with results of modern lattice\nQCD approaches. Most technical details are left out for the sake of clarity. For more dedicated reviews on this topic\nwe refer the reader to Refs. [1, 6, 241, 242]. In summary, DCC approaches can be extended to tackle finite-volume\nmulti-hadron systems. The main connection, to, e.g., the FVU approach in the finite volume becomes, however, clear\nwhen considering three-body systems. Indeed, three-body unitarity serves as the prime tool to identify on-shell configu-\nrations in interaction and propagation, both guiding the construction of infinite-volume amplitudes but also finite-volume\nquantization conditions. First Lattice QCD based studies of resonant three-meson systems are available in Ref. [164] for\nthea1(1260)) and in Ref. [135] for the \u03c9(782). Extensions of the method to excited baryon systems are underway [300].\n3. Light and strange baryons\n3.1. Background\nThe determination of the light baryon spectrum, its properties, and its interpretation has received increased attention\nin the past two decades. Situated in the intermediate energy region between low and high-energy QCD, light baryonic\nresonances represent the excited states of the proton and neutron, making them a bridge between matter as we know it,\nand the regime where QCD is understood perturbatively [301, 302].\nTheory predictions from quark models, dynamical quark and gluon approaches/functional methods, effective field\ntheories, and lattice QCD were and are tested in large experimental campaigns at facilities like JLab, ELSA, MAMI,\nLEPS and other experiments around the world. So much experimental and theoretical work has been invested in the\nstudy of light baryons that we can only aim at providing a complete overview of reviews on the topic, with an incomplete\nlist of papers tied to particular issues, in addition.\nThe canonical literature for meson-baryon scattering and resonances contains the book by Bransden and Moor-\nhouse [303]. The book by H\u00f6hler includes a technical discussion of (pion-nucleon) scattering theory [304] and is a widely\nused reference. Similarly, the book by Ericson and Weise [305] contains many aspects on pion-nucleon scattering, and the\nlecture series by Levi-Setti and Lasinski [306] has many derivations of commonly used formulas in scattering with spin.\nAn introductory work to K-matrix formalism was written by Chung et al. [307]. A lecture series by Dalitz was published\nin Ref. [308] discussing hadronic reactions and resonances, together with an introduction to dispersion theory. See also a\nmonograph [309] containing different contributions on \u201cElectromagnetic interactions and hadronic structure\u201d.\nFirstreviewsonmeson-baryonscatteringoftenhighlightedaspectsofduality,see,e.g.,Rosner[310],Donnachie\u2019sreview\non partial-wave analysis [311], and a discussion by Dalitz [312], \u201cWhat is resonance?\u201d A more recent review covering both\nexperimental aspects but also models and theories for light baryons was published by Klempt and Richard 15 years\nago [313]. This review is a good starting point for the topic of light baryons; it also contains a pedagogic introduction to\nquark models, see also Ref. [314] by Richard. An introduction to quark models was provided by Eichmann recently, as\nwell, containing aspects of the flavor structure of baryons and functional methods, in addition [315] (see also an update\n39\n\nin Ref. [316]). Mai recently provided a pedagogical introduction to resonances in Ref. [205] following a major review on\nthe same topic as a key to understanding QCD [1]. See also a discussion summary in Ref. [317].\nQuark models for excited baryons and other hadrons [318, 319, 319\u2013323] were discussed in a dedicated review by\nCapstick 20 years ago [324]. Over the years, the approach has been further refined in relativistic quark models with\ninstanton-induced quark forces [325\u2013328], quark-diquark models [329\u2013332], hypercentral constituent quark models [333\u2013\n336], in covariant models [337\u2013343] with predictions of electromagnetic properties including timelike form factors [344].\nFew-quark dynamics was even extended to five-body systems [345]. See also Refs. [346\u2013350] for other quark models\nand related approaches for excited baryons. A recent review [351] by Pe\u00f1a and Ramalho is dedicated to form factors,\ntheir parametrization [352, 353] and their connection to quark models. Hadronic reactions have been described in the\nframework of suitably extended constituent quark models, as well [354\u2013361], including even photoproduction reactions of\nbaryon resonances [362, 363]. The 1/Ncexpansion of baryons and its role in spectroscopy was discussed in Refs. [364\u2013374]\nand reviewed in Ref. [375] by Matagne.\nThe relativistic light-front quark model [376\u2013381] and its application to electroproduction reactions was revied by\nAzauryan and Burkert [382] and by Aznauryan, Bashir, Braun, Brodsky, and Burkert in Ref. [378]. See also Sect. 3.4\nthat contains a more detailed introduction to electroproduction reactions with its own literature overview. We mention\nhere only the short reviews by Carman and Mokeev [383, 384], and also by Dai, Haidenbauer, and Mei\u00dfner for timelike\nform factors [385]. New perspectives of exploring hadron structure through transition GPDs were recently summarized\nin a whitepaper [386].\nHolographic QCD is an approach with extra spatial dimensions to model hadrons, as explained in an introductory text\nby Erlich [387]. A suggestive example of a particle propagating in a compact extra dimension is provided to illustrate that\nexcited hadrons can be interpreted as Kaluza-Klein modes. Holographic QCD for baryon resonances has been proposed\nin Refs. [388, 389], see also Refs. [390, 391]. The approach of Ref. [389] is highly successful in organizing the hadron\nspectrum, although it underestimates the spin-orbit separations of the L=1orbital states. In Ref. [392] a two-parameter\nmass formula from quark-diquark correlations emerging from AdS/QCD was derived which reproduces the baryon mass\nspectrum with surprising precision. In Ref. [393] this and related approaches were reviewed by Brodsky, de Teramond,\nDosch, and Erlich.\nDyson-Schwinger approaches and functional methods have been developed to understand hadrons as reviewed by\nRoberts and Maris already 20 years ago [394, 395]. These methods were recently reviewed by Ding, Roberts, and\nSchmidt [396], following reviews by Roberts, Richards, Horn, and Chang [397], Burkert and Roberts [398], and Bashir\net al. [399] reflecting the progress in the baryon sector [400\u2013402] including the prediction of Transition Form Factors\n(TFFs) [403\u2013406], see Sect. 3.4 of this review. Furthermore, there is the review by Clo\u00ebt and Roberts [407] with emphasis\non the connection of the Schwinger-Dyson formalism to observables like form factors of pion and nucleon, and TFFs of\nexcited baryons.\nThere are reviews by Fischer and Eichmann [316, 408, 409] for functional methods, and Refs. [410\u2013417] in the context\nof excited baryons. The role of diquarks was reviewed by Barabanov et al. [332], see also Refs. [418, 419] for connections\nto Lattice QCD.\n(Excited) Meson and (excited) baryon degrees of freedom form the basis for Chiral Perturbation Theory (CHPT)\napproaches [420] to excited baryons [110, 421\u2013436]. See, for example, the reviews by Bernard, Kaiser, and Mei\u00dfner [437],\nby Pascalutsa, Vanderhaeghen, and Yang [438] on the \u2206(1232)resonance, and by Bernard [439].\nThrough the unitarization of a chiral (or other) interactions to a given order [440], light baryons [15, 39, 108, 188, 441\u2013\n460] or light-strange baryons [183, 184, 201, 277, 280, 281, 461\u2013470] can emerge (see remarkable progress for unifying\nthese sectors in Ref. [471]). Their description as dynamically generated states can be tested by coupling the photon\nto the constituents [38] and predicting electromagnetic properties [41\u201343, 124, 472\u2013488]. Analogously, coupling vector\nmesons to constituents allows for predictions of the corresponding reaction cross sections [489\u2013491]. Rescattering through\nchiral unitary potentials can be extended to three particles [492\u2013499]. There are reviews on coupled-channel scattering\nby Oller [500] and Oset et al. [200, 501\u2013503] with emphasis on chiral unitary methods and, at least partially, covering\nlight baryons. In this context, one has to mention the role of anomalous thresholds [504] and their effect in unitarization.\nIn certain kinematic regions they becomes so strong that even the dynamical generation of P-wave resonances becomes\npossible [505]. Compositeness criteria to assess the nature of light baryons in terms of meson and baryon components\nwere formulated and applied in Refs. [266, 506, 507]. Some baryonic resonances/structures in specific reactions have also\nbeen explained as enhancements due to triangle singularities [508\u2013511].\nThe Roy-Steiner set of equations were applied to the \u03c0Nand other sectors in Ref. [119, 120, 512, 513] and also used to\nextract resonance pole parameters including the \u2206(1232)and Roper resonances [122]. Furthermore, the authors confirm\na sub-threshold singularity on the unphysical sheet in S11close to the circular cut, see Sect. 3.3.6 for a more detailed\ndiscussion.\nAs for lattice QCD approaches for baryon spectroscopy, see Refs. [514\u2013519] and approaches in which phase shifts,\nscattering lengths and other properties are extracted [263, 264, 284, 520\u2013524], as well as pioneering studies on higher\nexcited baryons [261, 262, 286, 525\u2013532]. We refer to dedicated reviews and whitepapers for more details [6, 533, 534].\nFor the extraction of Low Energy Constants from global fits to baryon lattice QCD data, see Refs. [535, 536] as well as\n40\n\nthe dedicated sections in the FLAG report [537].\nThephenomenologyandexperimentalaspectsofbaryonspectroscopywerereviewedbyCredeandRobertsin2013[538],\nincluding also aspects of heavy baryons, quark models, and a discussion of the impact of modern experiments on the\nbaryon spectrum, especially from photoproduction reactions.\nMost recently, in 2022, Thiel, Afzal, and Wunderlich [539] reviewed the light baryon spectrum including a consistent\ncompendium of experimental results, discussion of complete experiments, different analysis frameworks (including DCC\napproaches), and impact on the baryon spectrum and its properties. Notably, this review provides also short introductions\nto theories and models for baryons like lattice QCD, quark models, Dyson-Schwinger methods etc. and represents a good\nstarting point to obtain an overview of these methods.\nThere are also specialized reviews on the data aspects, specific reactions, and specific resonances in light baryons\nspectroscopy. This includes a 2019 overview by Ireland, Pasyuk, and Strakovsky [540], an older review by Schadmand\nand Krusche on meson photoproduction from 2003 [541], an \u03b7physics handbook from 2002 [542], and an updated review\non\u03b7and\u03b7\u2032production on nucleons and nuclei by Krusche from 2014 [543]. One of the most prominent states of the baryon\nspectrum, the Roper resonance, N(1440)1/2+, was reviewed by Burkert and Roberts in Ref. [398], especially regarding the\nevidence of this resonance being the first radially excited state of the nucleon itself [417]. See also Ref. [544] by \u00c1lvarez\nRuso for a short review on the Roper resonance and Refs. [545\u2013547] for examples of the Roper resonance appearing in\nother reactions than \u03c0Nand\u03b3N-induced ones, including measurements and partial-wave analyses from BESIII.\nRegarding the role of amplitude analysis and high-energy parametrizations for light baryons, we mention work from\nJPAC and others [548\u2013556] for aspects of S-matrix theory, their connection to Regge theory, finite-energy sum rules, and\nthe formulation of new reaction amplitudes guided by these principles, as reviewed by JPAC in Ref. [199]. In the context\nof amplitude analysis for resonance physics, the review by Yao, Dai, Zheng, and Zhou [557] discusses the role of chiral\neffective field theory and dispersion relations in the determination of partial waves and their resonance content, for a wide\nrange of systems including \u03c0N.\nFinally, we mention the role of meson-baryon dynamics in related contexts. Meson and photon-induced reaction are\ndiscussed in depth in the following because DCC approaches have been developed for their analysis. However, light\nexcited baryons and, sometimes, their timelike electromagnetic form factors were also measured in pp-induced reactions\nat experiments like HADES [558\u2013560] and COSY-TOF [561\u2013563] and were analyzed by the Bonn-Gatchina (BnGa) group,\nSibirtsev et al., and others [344, 484, 564\u2013577]. See the review by Salabura [578].\nLagetreviewedexclusivemesonphotoproductionathighenergiesintheso-calledpartonicnon-perturbativeregime[579]\nthat is particularly relevant for current and future experiments at JLab and the EIC. The in-medium properties of excited\nbaryons were reviewed by Lenske [580], and, in close relation, by Metag [581]. Hadronic reactions close to thresholds have\nsimple kinematics and allow for tests of different models as reviewed by Moskal [582], see also Ref. [583]. Photoproduction\nreactions at low energies was reviewed in Ref. [584]. The field of light-strange baryons, including the \u039b(1405)is vast; the\ncontribution from DCC approaches in discussed in Sect. 3.6 and we mention here only the reviews by Hyodo [503, 585],\nMai [200], Mei\u00dfner on two-pole structures [502], and Tolos [586].\n3.2. Meson-induced reactions\nMeson beams are versatile probes for hadron spectroscopy. Elastic pion-nucleon scattering was the first reaction providing\naccess to the baryon spectrum in the classical partial-wave analyses by H\u00f6hler, Koch, and Cutkoski leading to the\nestablishment of many states by the 90\u2019s [118, 127, 587\u2013589]. See also the analysis by Manley et al. that includes elastic\n\u03c0Nscattering and the \u03c0\u03c0Nfinal state [590, 591] and the Carnegie-Mellon-Berkeley (CMB) model by Vrana, Dytman,\nand Lee [592] and by the Zagreb group [593\u2013596].\nThe analyses of \u03c0Nscattering including the reaction \u03c0N\u2192\u03b7Nand pion photoproduction on proton and neutron have\nbeen further refined to this day by the GWU/SAID analysis group [170, 597\u2013616]. The SAID pion and photon-induced\nformalisms were unified into a Chew-Mandelstam parametrization in Ref. [605]. The partial-wave dispersion relations\nby Frazer and Fulco [617] derived from the Mandelstam representation [618] provided useful constraints for many of the\n\u03c0Nanalyses. Notably, all other modern partial-wave analysis efforts rely on the SAID or other analyses for elastic pion\nscattering, although the ANL-Osaka analysis [78] follows a two-step procedure: (1) SAID input is used to locate the range\nof the parameters of the model; (2) The obtained parameters are refined and confirmed by directly comparing with the\noriginal \u03c0N-scattering data.\nIn Ref. [619] the covariance matrices between different partial waves of the SAID Single-Energy Solutions (SES) were\nprovided, that allow, in principle, to reconstruct a meaningful \u03c72representing the actual underlying data. However, this\nmeans one implicitly accepts the correction of systematic errors as applied by SAID. Systematic uncertainties and their\ncorrection are not small, at all, due to the problematic data situation of elastic \u03c0Nscattering. It is, therefore, better\n(albeit much more tedious) to fit the underlying \u03c0Ndata base with a procedure to correct for various normalization\nfactors [233] as practiced in Ref. [119] in which the \u03c0\u03c0\u2192\u00afNNprocess is related to the s-channel \u03c0N\u2192\u03c0Nreaction.\nMeson-induced reactions are central in any modern analysis aiming at a complete data description, but the available\ndata are problematic. In Ref. [620] a case for new measurements using meson beams was made with minor updates\n41\n\nregarding the planned Electron Ion Collider in Ref. [621]. Historically, the argument for using photons in the discovery of\nexcited baryons (instead of meson beams) was the sensitivity to states that couple only weakly to \u03c0N. A resonance that\ncouples substantially to the photon but weakly to the \u03c0Nchannel could be easier to detect in photoproduction reactions.\nReactions like \u03b3N\u2192\u03b7N, K \u039b, K\u03a3, . . .are ideal for this purpose. The downside of photoproduction is the larger number\nof amplitudes. In general, a resonance with given spin-parity JPcouples to both an electric and a magnetic multipole,\ni.e., more degrees of freedom are present in photoproduction reactions than in pion-induced reactions. This substantially\nincreases thenumberof necessary measurements todeterminean amplitude. Seenext section fora discussion on\u201ccomplete\nexperiments\u201d.\nIn addition, modern baryon spectroscopy analysis frameworks add the real or virtual photon to an existing hadronic\nrescattering part in one way or another [11, 27, 54\u201357, 59\u201361, 79, 81, 149, 622\u2013626] as discussed in Sect. 3.3. The\nrescattering part itself is constrained from pion-induced reactions. In that, any data problems in pion-induced reactions\nwill have consequences for the analysis of photon-induced reactions, especially when it comes to resonances that are tied\nto the strongly interacting rescattering part. This is particularly the case for pion-induced inelastic reactions such as\n\u03c0N\u2192\u03b7N,K\u039b,K\u03a3,\u03c9Nor three-body channels. On one hand, data in these reactions are known to be problematic\nas discussed below. On the other hand, new resonances coupling weakly to \u03c0Nare still more visible in these reactions\nthan in elastic \u03c0Nscattering. Summarizing, there are four reasons why re-measuring inelastic, pion-induced reactions\ncan significantly contribute to an improved and more quantitative understanding of the excited baryon spectrum, and\nthe discovery of new states: (a) the poor data situation, (b) reducing the bias for photoproduction analysis, (c) fewer\namplitudes than in \u03b3(\u2217)-induced reactions, and (d) sensitivity to channels other than \u03c0N(for inelastic reactions).\nOf the possible final states, the reactions \u03c0N\u2192\u03b7N, K \u039band\u03c0+p\u2192K+\u03a3+have to be highlighted because they isospin\nfilter I=1/2N\u2217\u2019s [53] and \u2206\u2019s [104], respectively. The reactions \u03c0N\u2192K\u039band\u03c0N\u2192K\u03a3provide unique information in\nthat the outgoing baryon is self-analyzing allowing for an easy access to spin observables. Take, for example, the reaction\n\u03c0+p\u2192K+\u03a3+measured in Ref. [627]. The measurements cover a substantial angular and energy range, and they include\ndata on differential cross sections and recoil polarization P. Together with much less precise data on the spinrotation\nparameter \u03b2from Ref. [628] the set of observables is almost complete (see, e.g., the discussion in Ref. [313]).\nRegarding the overall data situation, an overview of inelastic pion-induced reactions is provided in Table 3. The table\nis taken from Ref. [57] and amended by the available \u03c0N\u2192\u03c9Ndata collected and analyzed in Ref. [58]. The number\nof data points should be compared to the tens of thousands of data available in photoproduction reactions [57], or the\nhundreds of thousands of data in electroproduction [61].\nIn addition, the pion-induced reaction data often carry large uncertainties and are, in many cases, contradictory due\nto underestimated systematic effects. This leads to notoriously large \u03c72values in global fits, making the application of\ntraditional statistical criteria to, e.g., assess the significance of a signal for a new resonance, very difficult. The aim of a\nnew pion-induced experiment would not only be to provide more data, but, for the first time, provide consistent data.\nThis is indeed possible: for example, the EPECUR experiment has drastically improved the data situation in elastic\npion-nucleon scattering [630] (see, e.g., Fig. 4 in Ref. [621]). See also Ref. [631] for a demonstration how drastically the\nmeasurements of the K+\u03a3+final state can be improved with modern experimental techniques. Planned reactions with\nmeson beams at J-PARC are discussed in Ref. [632]; for the study of pion-induced reactions at HADES, see Ref. [633].\nThe situation for the inelastic reactions is illustrated in Fig. 22. The differential cross section data demonstrates that\nthe systematic problems are not just given by simple multiplicative factors that might be adjustable [233] \u2013the shapes of\nthe cross sections do not match. The plot of the spinrotation parameter \u03b2demonstrates how few data are available for\nthis most valuable experimental quantity; and the right-hand plot shows the typical quality for polarization data (that\nare supposed to be limited to \u2223P\u2223\u22641).\nThe total cross sections shown in Fig. 23 exhibit similar problems, i.e., clearly contradictory data. For example, the\ntotal cross section of the reaction \u03c0\u2212p\u2192K+\u03a3\u2212is almost impossible to describe due to a supposed structure around a\nscattering energy of E=z\u22482 GeV, which is, however, only due to one or two data points.

There is no polarization available for this reactions, at all.\nThe\u03c0N\u2192\u03c0\u03c0Nreaction also provides valuable information on the baryon spectrum and its few-body decays. Such\nreactions have been considered in the ANL-Osaka DCC approach as described below. Although the \u03c0N\u2192\u03c0\u03c0Ndata\nare few and similarly problematic as the data discussed before, new experimental efforts are being made at J-PARC\nin the E45 experiment to drastically increase the data base [634, 635]. Inelastic reactions like \u03c0N\u2192\u03c0\u03b7Nhave also\nbeen used to gain information on the dynamical nature of resonances like \u2206(1700)[485], see also recent progress by\nJPAC/GlueX/COMPASS [636\u2013639] in the context of searching for exotic mesons in this reaction.\nThe\u03c0\u03c0Nstates are known to have strong couplings with most of the high-mass nucleon resonances and, thus, are\nrelevant for spectroscopy. They are not directly included in the analysis of the nucleon resonances in the ANL-Osaka\nmodel. As a first step of a complete analysis to include two-body and three-body final states for the pion and photon\ninduced reactions, the \u03c0N\u2192\u03c0\u03c0N[82, 634] and \u03b3N\u2192\u03c0\u03c0N[83] reactions are studied within the DCC model [78, 87].\nThe situation of the theoretical approaches and the experimental data on \u03c0N\u2192\u03c0\u03c0Nare briefly summarized in Ref. [82].\nWith the approximation of Tdir\n\u03c0\u03c0N,\u03c0N(Eq.(2.31)) neglecting the final state interaction on the mechanisms (f)-(k) of\nv\u03c0\u03c0N,\u03c0Nin Fig. 3 [82], the \u03c0N\u2192\u03c0\u03c0Ncross section is calculated using information of the ANL-Osaka model [78, 87]\nwith no additional parameters. The total cross sections for five channels are compared with the data as shown in Fig. 24.\nThe red solid curves are from a recent version of the ANL-Osaka approach [87] while the green dotted curves are from\nthe previous JLMS model [78]. Both the magnitude and the energy dependence of the data for five 2\u03c0production can be\nreproduced to a very large extent. The direct mechanism Tdir\n\u03c0\u03c0N,\u03c0Nplays an important role especially for \u03c0+p\u2192\u03c0+\u03c0+n\nand\u03c0\u2212p\u2192\u03c0\u2212\u03c00p. In the low-energy region W<1.4 GeV, the calculation is comparable to the calculation of chiral\nperturbation theory. This suggests that the model of v\u03c0\u03c0N,\u03c0Nis reasonable and the discrepancies with the data in the\nhigher Wregion are more likely results from the uncertainties in the contribution for \u03c0\u2206, \u03c1Nand\u03c3Ntransitions.\n43\n\nFigure 24: The \u03c0N\u2192\u03c0\u03c0Ntotal cross section predicted by the ANL-Osaka models from Refs.

The data are from Arndt [640], with magnitudes determined by normalizing them to the total \u03c0N\u2192\u03c0\u03c0Ncross\nsection.\nIn summary, inconsistencies dominate the data uncertainties for pion-induced reactions. This has severe consequences\nfor baryon spectroscopy affecting the reliability of determining the spectrum, especially when it comes to hard statistical\ncriteria. Indirectly, these problems also affect the analysis of photoproduction reactions, in which so much experimental\nand analysis effort has been invested in the past decades. Having a large set of consistent data on pion-induced reactions,\nespecially inelastic ones, would allow one to take advantage of the inherent upsides of meson beams: Fewer amplitudes\nthan in photoproduction (for single-meson final states), easier to achieve \u201ccomplete experiment\u201d, larger cross sections\nand, to some extent, still having sensitivity to resonances that couple only weakly to \u03c0N. The \u03c0\u03c0Nfinal states were\npredicted by the ANL-Osaka approach demonstrating that DCC models can analyze these states. The impact of new data\non different analyses, such as J-PARC E45 [641], once available, could be quantified in common efforts across different\nanalysis groups as practiced in Ref. [610] for photoproduction.\n3.3. Photoproduction reactions\n3.3.1. Overview of different analysis frameworks\nIn the last three decades, a plethora of final states, differential cross sections, and spin observables were measured in\nphotoproductionreactionsatJLAB/CLAS[609,642\u2013646],CB-ELSA/TAPS[511,647\u2013653](continuedatthenewBGOOD\ndetector [654\u2013661]), MAMI/A2/CrystalBall [611, 662\u2013666], LEPS [667\u2013670], ELPH/FOREST [671], GRAAL [480, 672],\nand other facilities. Sometimes observables are tied to specific choices of reference frames that are not unique across\ndifferent experiments and analyses. The \u201cRosetta Stone Paper\u201d provides an overview [673].\nThe data and their analyses provided unprecedented information on baryonic resonances, not only for their electro-\nmagnetic properties, but also for the spectrum itself. Indeed, many new states were added to the Particle Data Book [103]\n44\n\nin the photoproduction era. States found before that were promoted in the PDG star rating while a few other ones de-\nscended or disappeared, see, e.g., Table 9 of Ref. [538]. In the reviews [313, 538\u2013540], comprehensive compilations of\ndata and their features can be found. We do not aim at replicating these works here and just pick out some interesting\nfindings in the context of DCC approaches and general hadron dynamics, see Sects 3.3.6 and 3.3.7. There are other topics\nbeyond the scope of this review like the efforts to experimentally confirm the GDH sum rule [615, 666, 674] or Compton\nscattering reviewed by Grie\u00dfhammer, McGovern, Phillips, and Feldman [675], including the role of the \u2206(1232)[676] in\nthe low-energy chiral expansion.\nThere are also extended discussions on specific structures that have attracted much attention such as a peak in \u03b7\nphotoproduction on the neutron at around W=1675 MeV that is absent at the proton target [649, 663]. This has\nbeen interpreted as an interference effect [677], a coupled-channel effect [479], or a new resonance [678], possibly a\npentaquark [679]. The need for a new narrow resonance was disputed in Ref. [680] by BnGa, and the Giessen group did\nnot find new narrow states for photoproduction on the proton [681].\nThe extraction of multipoles from photoproduction data is a challenge. There are continuous and discrete ambigui-\nties [682]. Due to the presence of electric and magnetic multipoles, the extraction requires in general more observables\nthan in reactions induced by spinless mesons. Such questions tied to \u201ccomplete experiments\u201d have been discussed in\nRefs. [683\u2013688] by Wunderlich et al.. There are two variants of this issue: How many measurements are needed to de-\ntermine the amplitude at a given energy and scattering angle [689], and, second, the \u201ctruncated partial-wave\u201d complete\nexperiment [685, 686, 690] that is somewhat more relevant when it comes to baryon spectroscopy of resonances with given\nJP. See Refs. [691, 692] for recent comparisons of these types of complete experiment and a discussion of the role of\nuncertainties. In relation to this, one of the tasks in spectroscopy is to determine which partial waves actually contribute\nin a given kinematic region. This question has been addressed in Ref. [693] for the baryon sector and in Ref. [227] as a\nproblem for which machine learning techniques can be used.\nIn practice, one needs assumptions on the amplitude to extract energy-dependent multipoles to reconstruct resonances\nand their electromagnetic properties. Assumptions on the smoothness of multipoles in energy are indeed mandatory as the\nset of observables is never complete in all kinematic regions. Starting from such energy-dependent solutions, single-energy\nsolutions (SES) can be derived in which the solutions are allowed to vary in an energy bin describing only the data in\nthat bin. One needs subsidiary conditions for this such as fixing multipole phases to avoid the SES to vary uncontrolled\nfrom bin to bin. This allows to scan for narrow structures and can also help detect systematic shortcomings of the global\nparametrization. See Refs. [694\u2013698] for recent progress in this direction using the Laurent-Pietarinen expansion, as well\nas Refs. [699, 700] in which t-channel analyticity and unitarity have been used to constrain the determination of single-\nenergy solutions. Resonance pole parameters in the complex plane can be determined by fitting them with meromorphic\nfunctions [697]. The Mittag-Leffler expansion is used in [171, 701] by introducing the uniformization variable discussed\nin section 2.9.1.\nMany frameworks have been developed for the analysis of meson photoproduction reactions - sometimes, the efforts\nare bundled, e.g., to study the impact of new polarization data on the different analysis frameworks [610]. We discuss\nhere only approaches that do notfall into the DCC category. The ANL-Osaka and JBW approaches have been discussed\nin depth in this review, while other DCC approaches have been summarized in Sect. 1.2. Furthermore, we discuss here\napproaches that, in many cases, not only analyze photoproduction but also pion-induced reactions.\nThe SAID group including Arndt, Briscoe, Schmidt, Strakovsky, Workman et al. developed one of the earlier ap-\nproaches for the analysis of photoproduction on the proton [603, 604, 616, 664, 702] but also neutron [612\u2013614] as reviewed\nin Ref. [703]. For the latter case, mostly referring to photoproduction on the deuteron, there are strong corrections (Fermi\nmotion and final state interactions) that have to be taken into account [704, 705]. As discussed in Sect. 3.2, the photo-\nproduction and pion-induced reactions were formulated in a unified SAID framework in Ref. [605].\nThe MAID unitary isobar approach to meson photoproduction has also evolved over time. After initial studies using\neffective Lagrangian approaches [706, 707] and fixed-t dispersion relations [708], Drechsel, Hanstein, Kamalov, Tiator\net al. developed the unitary isobar MAID framework in Ref. [622] for pion photoproduction. In another single-channel\nanalysis, the framework was extended to \u03b7photo and electroproduction [709] with a reggeized version for the background\npresented in Ref. [710]. Kaon photoproduction was studied in KAON-MAID [711, 712] by Bennhold, Haberzettl, Lee,\nMart, and Wright, within a tree-level model that incorporates hadronic form factors consistent with gauge invariance.\nThe MAID 2007 approach is a unified analysis of pion photo and electroproduction [624] using suitably unitarized Breit-\nWigner forms for the resonances. The paper also contains an overview of the historic evolution of the MAID approach.\nSee also Sect. 3.4 for a more specific literature review on electroproduction and the respective analysis frameworks. An\nanalysis of low-energy \u03b3(\u2217)-induced data with chiral perturbation theory was performed under the chiral MAID label in\nRefs. [713, 714]. An update on \u03b7and\u03b7\u2032photoproduction was published in Ref. [715]. Finally, Ref. [716] summarizes the\nlegacy of MAID and points towards future developments of the approach.\nIn the BnGa approach both pion and photon-induced reactions are analyzed simultaneously [717], like in the ANL-\nOsaka and JBW approaches. While electroproduction reactions are not yet considered, the range of analyzed photopro-\nductions is larger than in the DCC approaches. Apart from the reactions analyzed in the mentioned DCC approaches,\nthe BnGa group analyzes also three-body final states of reactions like \u03b3p\u2192\u03c00\u03b7por\u03c00\u03c00p[652, 718, 719].

[623] with main results published in Ref. [625], which have been updated\nbased on new data and reactions over the years [651, 729, 730], such as \u03c9photoproduction [731, 732]. Evidence for several\nnew excited baryons and new decay channels of known baryons was found [718, 733\u2013739] leading to substantial updates\nof the Particle Data Book, for example for a N(1900)3/2+[740, 741] and a N(1895)1/2\u2212[653]. The case of the latter\nresonance is particularly intriguing due to the closeness of the \u03b7\u2032pthreshold [653]. In Ref. [742] BnGa explored the region\nof high-lying states and found evidence for four new states by performing mass scans. In this technique, resonances are\ninserted into the amplitude as Breit-Wigner forms with their masses held fixed and other parameters allowed to re-adjust\nwith the data. The \u03c72is plotted as a function of the mass, preferably for different final states. Simultaneous minima of the\n\u03c72for different final states are taken as a signal for a new resonance at that mass. The four new states were interpreted\nin light of the general mass ordering expected in quark models from the spin-flavor symmetry leading to the group SU(6)\nthat is decomposed into 70-plets etc., which can then further be decomposed into different SU(3) groups with different\nspin multiplicities. An organization of states in spin doublets and quartets is plausible. If that is the case, \u201cthe diquark\nhypothesis - which freezes one pair of quarks into a quasi-stable S-wave flavor diquark - is ruled out as explanation of the\nmissing resonance problem\u201d [743]. Dynamical diquarks behave differently [332, 402].\nThe Giessen coupled-channel approach by Lenske, Mosel, Penner, Shklyar et al. employed a coupled-channel K-matrix\nformalism for the combined analysis of pion and photon-induced reactions [677, 681, 744\u2013749] including vector meson and\n\u03c0\u03c0Nfinal states in form of the partial-wave results by Manley [591]. The Kent state analyses by Manley et al. addressed\na variety of final states including \u03c0N[591, 750\u2013752] but also inelastic, pion and photon-induced reactions [750], using\na product S-matrix approach. Single-energy solutions [753] provide additional insight into structures not uncovered by\nglobal, energy-dependent multi-channel fits.\nEffective Lagrangian or Regge plus resonance approaches have also served as a tool to extract information on excited\nbaryonsfromphotoproductionreactionsbyKim, Mart, Petrellis, Skoupil, Wang, Xie, andmanyothers[229,231,526,754\u2013\n785], see also the work by the Ghent group [218, 219] in combination with statistical tools as discussed in Sect. 2.10.2. In\naddition, effective Lagrangian approaches have been used to analyze related reactions simultaneously [786] exploiting the\nuniversality of resonance couplings. For such approaches the question of maintaining gauge invariance becomes relevant;\nRegge amplitudes with gauge invariance have been discussed by Haberzettl [787, 788] and JPAC [789]; a related issue is\nthe construction of gauge invariant form factors [790, 791]. See also Refs. [553, 792, 793] for \u03c00, \u03b7, and \u03b7\u2032photoproduction\nat high energies using Regge theory and finite-energy sum rules, in connection with the first GlueX experiments [794].\n3.3.2. Photoproduction in the JBW approach\nThe interaction of the photon with the hadronic interactions is constrained by gauge invariance in terms of the Ward-\nTakahashi identity [37, 724, 795, 796]. Based on the formalism of Refs. [797, 798], single meson photoproduction was\nstudied within the JBW approach by Huang et al. in Ref. [44]. The hadronic part of the JBW model was taken as\nfinal state interaction for a gauge invariant coupling scheme of the photon to s, t,andu-channel processes, as well as a\ngeneralized, gauge-restoring contact term, to compute the pion photoproduction current M\u00b5. This is indicated in Fig. 26.\nThe starting point is the topology of the \u03c0NNvertex with the photon coupling to all legs. In addition, the photon can\ncouple to the internal components of the complicated rescattering part which is parametrized with the contact term taking\ninto account the internal structure. One obtains a tower of coupled non-linear Dyson-Schwinger-type equations that can\nonly be solved iteratively. In practice, it is subject to a gauge-invariant truncation for the dressed nucleon current and the\ncontact-type five-point current [44]. For this purpose, the non-covariant normalization of the scattering equation (2.47)\nis transformed into the Kadyshevsky equation [32] which is a covariant three-dimensional reduction of the Bethe-Salpeter\nequation that preserves elastic unitarity. The photoproduction current is then constructed within the same covariant,\nthree-dimensional reduction. With an efficient parametrization of the contact term in terms of a few parameters, neutral\nand charged pion photoproduction data were fitted up to E=1.65 GeVbecause only resonances up to spin J=3/2were\nincluded in Ref. [44]. Some coupling constants were taken from the literature, and only about 40 parameters (most of\nthem resonance couplings to the photon) were varied to obtain an excellent description of differential cross sections and\n46\n\nphoton spin-asymmetry data on a proton as well as a neutron target [44]. This demonstrates that gauge invariance is not\nonly a theoretical requirement but can be helpful in guiding the construction of efficiently parametrized amplitudes.\nIn subsequent analyses of photoproduction reactions, the JBW amplitude was technically simplified by switching to a\npartial-wave-wise parametrization. The photoproduction multipole amplitude in terms of a photoproduction kernel V\u00b5\u03b3\nis given by [54]\nM\u00b5\u03b3(q, E)=V\u00b5\u03b3(q, E)+\u2211\n\u03ba\u221e\n\u222b\n0dp p2T\u00b5\u03ba(q, p;E)G\u03ba(p, E)V\u03ba\u03b3(p, E). (3.1)\nHere, the index \u03b3is used exclusively for the \u03b3Nchannel. Note that in the second term V\u03ba\u03b3produces a meson-baryon\npair in channel \u03bawith off-shell momentum pthat rescatters via the hadronic (partial-wave projected) half-offshell T-\nmatrix from Eq. (2.57), producing the final \u03c0Nstate (more generally, channel \u00b5) with momentum q. The meson-baryon\npropagator G\u03bais defined in Eq. (2.58) for two-body intermediate state; for three-body intermediate states see Sect. 2.7.2.\nThe photoproduction kernel can be written as\nV\u00b5\u03b3(p, E)=\u03b1NP\n\u00b5\u03b3(p, E)+\u2211\ni\u03b3a\n\u00b5;i(p)\u03b3c\n\u03b3;i(E)\nE\u2212Mb\ni. (3.2)\nHere, \u03b1NP\n\u00b5\u03b3represents the photon coupling to t- and u-channel diagrams and to contact diagrams. These diagrams together\nform the non-pole part of the full photoproduction kernel as can bee seen from field-theoretical considerations [796]. Note\nthat the form of the photoproduction kernel allows one to vary the strength of resonances and background independently\nwithout violating Watson\u2019s theorem [799]. The summation in Eq. (3.2) is over the resonances iin a multipole, and the\n\u03b3c\n\u03b3;iare the real-valued tree-level \u03b3NN\u2217\niand\u03b3N\u2206\u2217\niphoton couplings. It is crucial that the resonance annihilation vertex\n\u03b3ain Eq. (3.2) is precisely the same as in the hadronic part of Eq. (2.59) so that the explicit singularity at E=Mb\ni\ncancels.\nThe two-potential formalism allows one to rewrite the photoproduction amplitude Mas\nM\u00b5\u03b3=\u03b1NP\n\u00b5\u03b3+\u2211\n\u03baTNP\n\u00b5\u03baG\u03ba\u03b1NP\n\u03ba\u03b3+\u0393a\n\u00b5;i(D\u22121)ij\u0393c\n\u03b3;j\n\u0393c\n\u03b3;j=\u03b3c\n\u03b3;j+\u2211\n\u03ba\u0393c\n\u03ba;jG\u03ba\u03b1NP\n\u03ba\u03b3 (3.3)\nwith the dressed resonance propagator Dfrom Eq. (2.65) and with the dressed resonance-creation photon-vertex \u0393c\n\u03b3;j\nwhich is a vector in resonance space, like the strong dressed vertex \u0393c\n\u00b5;iin Eq. (2.65). This standard result has been\nderived, e.g., in Ref. [124]. In the form of Eq. (3.3) it becomes apparent that in M\u00b5\u03b3all singularities due to the bare\nresonance propagators of Eq. (3.2) have canceled.\nAlternatively, one can write the amplitude simply in terms of the full hadronic T-matrix as\nM\u00b5\u03b3=\u2211\n\u03ba(1\u2212V G)\u22121\n\u00b5\u03baV\u03ba\u03b3. (3.4)\nIn principle, any of the forms (3.1), (3.3), or (3.4) can be used in practical calculations. In the form of Eq. (3.4), which\nresembles the one of Ref. [800], the similarity with the CM12 Chew-Mandelstam parameterization of the SAID group [605]\nbecomes apparent, in which the hadronic kernel \u00afK\u03ba\u03bdof their hadronic T-matrix,\nT\u00b5\u03bd=\u2211\n\u03ba(1\u2212\u00afKC)\u22121\n\u00b5\u03ba\u00afK\u03ba\u03bd, (3.5)\nis replaced by a photoproduction kernel, \u00afK\u03ba\u03b3,\nM\u00b5\u03b3=\u2211\n\u03ba(1\u2212\u00afKC)\u22121\n\u00b5\u03ba\u00afK\u03ba\u03b3. (3.6)\nHere, Cis the complex Chew-Mandelstam function that guarantees two-body unitarity and even the complex thresholds\nfor effective three-body channels [605]. While Eq. (3.6) is formally identical to Eq. (3.4), there is a practical difference:\nEq. (3.4) implies an integration over intermediate off-shell momenta, while the quantities \u00afKandCin Eq. (3.6) factorize.\nIn both approaches the dispersive parts of the intermediate loops GandCare maintained. In the JBW approach, the\nterms \u03b1NP\n\u00b5\u03b3and\u03b3c\n\u03b3;iin Eq.

Equation(3.7)means\nthat one has n+mpolynomials per multipole with nresonances iandmhadronic channels \u00b5. With this parameterization,\n47\n\nnon-analyticities from left-hand cuts, like the one from the pion-pole term, are approximated. As the distance to the\nphysical region is quite large, such an approximation can be justified. Note in this context that even for the \u03b3\u03b3\u2192\u03c0\u03c0\nreaction that has a very close-by left-hand cut, the Born contributions can be effectively parameterized by a linear\npolynomial [801]. In any case, it is clear that in this multipole-wise parametrization one needs substantially more fit\nparameters than in the plane-wave approach of Ref. [44] in which gauge invariance was used to guide the parametrization.\nThis review is focused on summarizing and explaining the formal aspect of DCC approaches. Therefore, we keep the\ndiscussion of applications of the JBW model to photoproduction very short. Pion photoproduction on the proton up to\nan energy of E\u22482.3 GeVwas analyzed in Ref. [54], including also isospin breaking at low energies due to hadronic mass\ndifferences within the pion and nucleon multiplets. About 20,000 data for differential cross sections and all polarization\nobservables available at that time were analyzed, with some exclusion of data in the extreme forward direction because the\napproach was truncated at a total angular momentum of J=9/2. Photocouplings were extracted at the resonance poles\nand compared to values of the SAID and BnGa approaches. Notably, these helicity amplitudes are complex and not real\nas they would be for a Breit-Wigner formulation. In the pole definition, photocouplings are, by definition, independent\nof the final state because coupled-channel amplitude factorize at resonance poles. The photoproduction data of the \u03b7N,\nK\u039b, and K\u03a3final states were successively added in the respective analysis updates in Refs. [55], [56], and [57], with an\naccumulated data set of more than 70,000 points. All fit results to all data (pion- and photon-induced) are documented\non a web site [629]. Results of electroproduction fits are collected on a different, interactive website [802], see Sect. 3.4.\nMany resonance pole positions, branching ratios, and electromagnetic couplings determined in the JBW approach are\nquoted in the PDG \u201cabove the line\u201d [103].\n3.3.3. The weak \u039bdecay parameter \u03b1\u2212from CLAS data\nFor reactions with \u039band\u03a3final states, it should be noted that in experimental analyses the weak asymmetry parameter\n\u03b1\u2212scales the values of polarization observables. The value of this fundamental constant was questioned through new ex-\nperimental evidence at BESIII [803]. In Ref. [804], Ireland and JBW independently determined \u03b1\u2212using photoproduction\ndata in combination with Fierz identities,\nO2\nx+O2\nz+C2\nx+C2\nz+\u03a32\u2212T2+P2=1 (3.8)\n\u03a3P\u2212CxOz+CzOx\u2212T=0. (3.9)\nAs all observables in Eqs. (3.8) and (3.9) were measured by CLAS [642, 643, 805], these Fierz identities can be used to\nestimate the calibration parameters l,c, and a, where landcare the relative systematic uncertainties of the linear and\ncircular photon polarization, while avaries the value of the weak decay parameter \u03b1\u2212. It is known that Ox, Oz, Tscale\nwith al,CxandCzscale with ac,\u03a3scales with l, and Pwith a. If one has sufficiently many measurements, this set of\nscaling conditions together with the Fierz identities of Eqs. (3.8, 3.9) allow to extract the scaling factor a, and, hence,\na re-determination of \u03b1\u2212. Special care has to be paid to statistical aspects as this problem bears a few intricacies: the\nFierz identities are to be fulfilled in a statistical sense; the estimation of normalization factors is notoriously prone to\nbiases that have to be avoided; and the distribution of the systematic uncertainties for linear and circular polarization\nare unknown. Using different priors for these distributions, a new value of \u03b1\u2212=0.721(6)(5)was found which is close\nto, but not compatible with, the new BESIII value of \u03b1\u2212=0.750(9)(4). In contrast, the previous PDG value [806] of\n\u03b1\u2212=0.642(13)had been accepted and used for over 40 years, affecting all hyperon polarization data. The results are\nsummarized in Fig. 27. In Ref. [804], the data affected by the change in \u03b1\u2212data were re-fitted with the JBW approach.\nThe re-analysis shows that the lowest \u03c72is indeed obtained with the \u03b1\u2212value obtained from CLAS data, pointing towards\ninternal consistency of the new value, that is now quoted in the PDG \u201cabove the line\u201d [103].\n3.3.4.

In the following, we simply write \u03b1=\u03b3Nand\u03b2=M\u2032B\u2032to make clear the\nFock-space component of the states.

The contribution of non-\nresonant processes is called the \u201cmeson cloud effect\u201d.\nThe pion photoproduction reactions are investigated up to the second resonance region 1.1<W<1.6GeV in Ref. [79].\nStarting from the strong interaction model JLMS [78] of the pion induced reaction, the bare resonance helicity amplitudes\nare the only free parameters adjusted to describe the data of pion photoproduction. Large effects of coupled channel in\nthe second resonance region are found. The Q2dependence of the meson could effects are studied, which are important\nin the low- Q2region.\nThe current ANL-Osaka DCC model [87] is an extension of the JLMS model [78]. In the extension (1) K\u039band\nK\u03a3states are included in addition to the \u03c0N, \u03b7N, \u03c0\u03c0N and\u03c0\u2206, \u03c1N, \u03c3N states, (2) a unified analysis of \u03c0Nand\u03b3N\nreactions is performed, (3) the analysis is extended to include higher-energy\u221as<2.1GeV reactions. The single energy\nsolutions of the SAID partial wave amplitudes are fitted up to\u221as<2.3GeV while \u03c0Nand\u03b3Nreactions are analyzed\nbelow\u221as<2.1GeV.

Summary of the light baryon spectrum\nIn Fig. 29 the baryon spectrum is shown as determined by the ANL-Osaka [87] and the JBW [57] approaches.

The two lower pictures\n49\n\nFigure 28: Graphical illustration of the contribution of the \u03c0Nintermediate state to the dressed \u03b3N\u2192N\u2217[76] transition. The term in brackets\nillustrates the meson-cloud effect.\ndisplay similar information in bar plots, but with PDG states in addition. Here, the heights of the bars correspond to the\nresonance widths. The resonance spectrum in the JBW approach has changed over the years, with an example discussed\nin Sect. 3.3.7.\nOverall, both approaches exhibit a similar spectrum although there are remarkable differences, especially for some of\nthe widths. Other than S11andP11, both approaches find two N\u2217with JP=3/2+, but the heavier one differs in mass\nand width. For JP=1/2\u2212andJP=3/2\u2212, the JBW approach has only one \u2206resonance, while the ANL-Osaka has two.\nFor the positive parity JP=3/2+, both approaches have, of course, the \u2206(1232). The JBW approach has a \u2206(1600)\nand a very wide, heavy \u2206resonance. It is debatable how stable such wide resonances are under re-parameterizations of\nthe amplitude, which is why the ANL-Osaka approach only quotes states up to 400 MeV width. See also Sect. 2.10.2\nwhere stability tests for resonance signals are discussed. Another question is the bias induced by fitting to the SAID\npartial-wave analysis. Like in many other analyses, information from SAID on elastic \u03c0Nscattering is contained in both\nanalyses, and many states of the SAID analysis are also quoted in the PDG. This might induce a confirmation bias. The\nsolution lies in directly fitting the elastic \u03c0Ndata. However, this is complicated because of a very inhomogeneous data\nset with systematic uncertainties that are often unknown. See Sect. 3.2 for a discussion.\n3.3.6. Highlight: The S11partial wave\nTheJP=1/2\u2212partial wave features the excited states N(1535),N(1650)and, possibly, an N(1895). As Fig. 29 shows,\nthe ANL-Osaka and JBW approaches find the first two resonances but not the third state. The latter state has been been\nfound in the BnGa analysis that also contains the \u03b7\u2032Nchannel [653] (it is also found in the Kent State analysis [751]).\nOnce the DCC approaches contain this channel, a need for that state may arise.\nTheoretical interest in studying the first state, N(1535), roots in the fact that it is heavier than the second state\nof the parity-partner channel P11, the Roper resonance N(1440), which challenges the expectation from quark models\n[318, 319, 326]. Furthermore, inelastic meson-baryon thresholds ( \u03b7N,K\u039b, and K\u03a3) are located close to the first two\nJP=1/2\u2212states, such that coupled channel effects need to be taken into account. In Ref. [808] it was argued that the\nN(1535)couples even stronger to the K\u039bthan to the \u03b7Nchannel by examining BES data, see also Ref. [809].\nWithin chiral unitary models, it was realized early [460] that low-lying S11resonances might not be a three-quark\n(pre-existing) states but rather be generated by strong channel dynamics, with a substantial K\u03a3\u2212K\u039bcomponent in their\nwave functions. This idea was extended in Ref. [188], where within certain approximations the effects of 3-body \u03c0\u03c0N\nchannels were also included. In Ref. [457], the S11phase shift was fitted from threshold to about\u221as\u22432 GeVtogether with\ncross section data for \u03c0\u2212p\u2192\u03b7nand\u03c0\u2212p\u2192K0\u039bin the respective threshold regions. This led to a satisfactory description\nof the S11phase. Two poles were found corresponding to the S11(1535)and the S11(1650)resonances together with a\nclose-by unphysical pole on the first Riemann sheet. More recently, it was pointed out in a meson-exchange model that\nthere is indeed strong resonance interference between the two S11resonances, as each of these resonances provides an\nenergy-dependent background in the region of the other [115].\nIn Sect. 2.10.1 a scheme to solve the four-dimensional Bethe-Salpeter equation with chiral LO and NLO contact terms\nwas discussed. The resulting coupled-channel, chiral unitary amplitude was derived in Ref. [39], and the low-energy\nconstants were fitted to the SAID partial waves providing a compelling picture of a dynamically generated N(1535)\nas a pole on the second Riemann sheet shown in Fig. 13. Additionally, a second pole is recorded outside of the fitted\nenergy region. It is quite tempting to assume this to be a prediction of the N(1650)state from chiral dynamics and\ncoupled-channel unitarity.\nCoupled-channel dynamics is an integral aspect of the N(1535), irrespective of its nature. This resonance is located\nvery closely to the \u03b7Nthreshold to which it also couples very strongly [103]. As resonance poles usually repeat on different\nRiemann sheets (see discussion in Sec. 2.9.1), one has here the situation of a regular N(1535)and a hidden N\u2032(1535)on\na different sheet that, together, generate the particular \u03b7Ncusp structure of the S11partial wave as illustrated in Fig. 30.\nIt should be noted that this is not what is usually referred two as \u201ctwo-pole nature\u201d of a resonance. In the limit of\nvanishing coupling of a resonance to an inelastic two-body channel, it (trivially) repeats on both sheets of that channel\nat the exact same position. If the channel coupling is stronger, as it is the case for the N(1535)and the \u03b7Nchannel,\nthe poles repeat at substantially different positions. In contrast, the \u039b(1405), which is believed to have a true two-pole\nnature, has both its poles on the same Riemann sheet [280, 281].\n50\n\n\u25cf\n\u25cf\n\u25b2\u25b2\n\u25c6 \u25c6JBW2022\n1/2-3/2-5/2-\n7/2-9/2-\nANL-Osaka\u25cf1/2-\n\u25b23/2-\n\u25c65/2-\n1600 1800 2000 22000100200300400\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\u25b2\u25b2\n\u25c6 \u25c6JBW2022\n1/2-3/2-5/2-\n7/2-9/2-\nANL-Osaka\u25cf1/2-\n\u25b23/2-\n\u25c65/2-\n1600 1800 2000 2200 2400 26000100200300400\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\u25b2\u25b2\n\u25c6 \u25c6JBW2022\n1/2+3/2+5/2+\n7/2+9/2+\nANL-Osaka\u25cf1/2+\n\u25b23/2+\n\u25c65/2+\n1400 1600 1800 2000 2200 24000100200300400\n\u25cf \u25cf\n\u25b2\u25b2\n\u25c6 \u25c6\u25a0 \u25a0JBW2022\n1/2+3/2+5/2+\n7/2+\nANL-Osaka\u25cf1/2+\n\u25b23/2+\u25c65/2+\n\u25a07/2+\n1200 1400 1600 1800 20000200400600800\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\u25cf\u25cf\nJBW2022\n\u25cfANLPDG\n1/2- 1/2+ 3/2- 3/2+ 5/2- 5/2+ 7/2- 7/2+ 9/2- 9/2+120014001600180020002200\n\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\u25cf\u25cf\n\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\u25cf\u25cf\nJBW2022\n\u25cfANLPDG\n1/2- 1/2+ 3/2- 3/2+ 5/2- 5/2+ 7/2- 7/2+ 9/2-1200140016001800200022002400Figure 29: Summary of results for the baryon parameters obtained in the ANL-Osaka [87] and JBW [57] approaches. The error bars in the\nupper four plots show uncertainties, the lengths of the bars in the two lower plots correspond to the resonance widths. For these cases, PDG\ninformation [103] is displayed in blue. Note that for the ANL-Osaka model, only resonances up to 2 GeVin mass and 400 MeV in width are\nquoted.\nTo the right in Fig. 30, the real part of S11from the fit of Ref. [124] is shown (dark red). In addition we show the\n\u201cpole approximations\u201d (PA) of the N(1535)and the hidden N\u2032(1535)with the solid and dotted blue line as indicated in\nthe figure. These curves are given by a\u22121/(E\u2212E0)where a\u22121is the residue of the pole at E=E0. Consequently, the\ndotted curve only shows the \u201cshoulder\u201d of the hidden N\u2032(1535). Indeed, the shapes of these two PA\u2019s explain the cusp\nquantitatively. Still the PA\u2019s of the N(1535)andN(1650)show a large offset with the actual partial wave - this reflects\nthe fact that each of these resonances provides a substantial background for the other one.\nIn addition to these PA\u2019s, there is another PA from a virtual state (VS) at E0=(1031\u2212i203)MeV shown with the\ndashed line, that explains the sharp rise of the S11partial wave at threshold. While that state was found in Ref. [124] in\n2009, no claims for its existence were made as it is located far from the physical axis and the amplitude parametrization\nof Ref. [124] was rather simple. However, this state has recently received substantial interest. In Ref. [810] (see also\nRef. [811]), Wang et al. discovered it at E0=(861\u00b153)\u2212i(130\u00b175)MeVusing the general Peking University (PKU)\nrepresentation [812\u2013815] in connection with relativistic baryon chiral perturbation theory to estimate the contributions\nfrom the left-hand cut. In Ref. [816] the sub-threshold singularity was found again at E0=(918\u00b13)\u2212i(163\u00b19)MeVin\na Roy-Steiner analysis that was checked numerically with the previous framework of Hoferichter et al. [119]. Resonance\npoles in the latter analysis were searched in Ref. [122]. Apart from a determination of the \u2206(1232)and Roper poles, the\nsubthreshold pole at E0=(913.9\u00b11.6)\u2212i(168.9\u00b13.1)MeVwas found again. There have also been dispersive studies of\nlow-energy pion photoproduction [817, 818] extracting the photocoupling of that state which was found to be substantial.\n51\n\nN(1535)N\u2032 (1535)\n\u03b7N\n\u03c0NN\u2032 (1650)K\u03a3K\u039bN(1535)N(1650)VSN\u2032 (1535)\u03b7N\n1200140016001800-0.4-0.20.00.20.4\nE/MeVReS11Figure 30: Left: In orange, the N(1535)on the sheet connected to the physical axis (red line) above the \u03b7Ncusp; in blue, a hidden replica\nN\u2032(1535)on the sheet connected to the physical axis below the \u03b7Ncusp.

The enhancement of Re S11at the \u03c0Nthreshold is due to a virtual state (VS) as the blue dashed line shows. See text\nfor further explanations. Figures adapted from Ref. [124].\nThe pole trajectory of the state with pion mass has been studied in a linear \u03c3model [819]. While there are now strong\nindications for this state, \u201cthe physical interpretation of this singularity is far from obvious, as its position, far in the\ncomplex plane, casts doubts on its relevance for observables in the physical region\u201d [122].\n3.3.7. Highlight: The P11partial wave\nIn the nucleon channel JP=1/2+, the properties, interactions, and nature of the N(1440)or Roper resonance [597, 820]\nhave been discussed extensively. The reversed mass pattern between N(1535)andN(1440)appeared as a puzzle in quark\nmodels [318, 319, 326]. A proper description in the constituent quark model can be achieved by including Goldstone\nbosons as effective degrees of freedom [821]. Note that most recent functional methods do indeed reproduce the right\nordering [410]. For further details see the review [398].\nPhenomenological analyses reveal an intricate analytic structure of the Roper [115, 170, 544] including strong coupling\nto the three-body channels. Indeed, the P11partial wave has an early and strong onset of inelasticity [170]. This is related\nto the fact that for the JP=1/2+quantum numbers three particles \u03c0, \u03c0, Ncan all be in a relative S-wave, i.e., there\nis no centrifugal barrier that could suppress the influence of three-body channels in the \u03c3Nchannel (and other effective\ntwo-body channels such as a \u03c0Nsystem with JP=1/2\u2212and a third pion). In addition, the Roper pole is close to the\ncomplex \u03c0\u2206branch point as shown in Fig. 14. As poles repeat on different sheets, there is a complicated interaction of\ntwo poles and a complex branch point as first noted by the SAID group [170]. On the physical axis, this leads to the\nunusual, non-Breit-Wigner shape of the Roper. As discussed before, one would notrefer to this as a two-pole resonance\nlike the \u039b(1405), since for the latter both poles lie on the same Riemann sheet.\nAs there is a \u03c3Nchannel in relative S-wave, where \u03c3stands for the f0(500), the \u201cthreshold\u201d of that pseudo-two-body\nsystem lies, indeed, around the Roper N(1440)mass. Dynamically generated states are often situated close to two-\nbody S-wave thresholds, and, indeed, the Roper resonance has been found as dynamically generated from this channel\nin the JB approach without a qqqcore [49, 51]. Mass trajectories in specific amplitude parametrization, that fit QCD\nlattice eigenvalues, seem to support the dynamical generation [525]. A substantial ingredient in this picture is also the\nrenormalized nucleon pole that has a pole part reaching to energies above the \u03c0Nthreshold (see Sect. 2.6.3 and Fig. 38\nin Ref. [53]). The Roper resonance was also dynamically generated in the multichannel model of Refs. [822, 823] in which\nquark model predictions were used to fix coupling constants.\nIn the ANL-Osaka model, the Roper resonance resonance appears from dressing a bare state (\u201cgenuine resonance\u201d)\nthrough coupled channels [86]. In fact, even the next-higher state, the N(1710)1/2+originates from the same bare state\nas shown in Fig. 31 to the left. The corresponding trajectories are obtained by slowly switching on the bare pole self\nenergies in the different channels. While both pictures of the Roper are intriguing and allow for their own interpretation,\nthey also demonstrate the dependence of the interpretations (of the same data) on the underlying parametrization.

Shown are fit A (solid red lines) and fit B (dashed blue\nlines) that represent fits to the energy-dependent GWU/SAID solution [170] (dash-dotted green lines). The single-energy solution [170] (data\npoints) is notincluded in the fitting procedure but predicted. Figures taken from Refs. [53, 86].\nFig. 43 of Ref. [53] the dependence of the bare mass on the bare resonance couplings and included channels was studied.\nIt was shown that one can obtain very similar descriptions of the \u2206(1620)amplitude in the S31wave for variations of the\nbare mass over more than a GeV (with corresponding variations of bare couplings). In contrast, as expected, resonance\nresidues change very little.\nThe dependence of the extracted resonance parameters on the reaction model and the accuracy of the empirical partial\nwave amplitude are commonly investigated issues. In the ANL-Osaka model, the analytic structure of the P11amplitude\nnear the nucleon pole is rather different from the JBW model. In Ref. [128], a bare nucleon state is included with mass\nand vertex renormalization. Then, the SAID amplitude is re-fitted and the CMB amplitude is examined for comparison.\nThe results indicate that the pole structure of the Roper resonance is rather insensitive to the analytic structure below\nthe\u03c0Nthreshold. In addition, the study showed the need for more accurate data in the\u221as>1.6GeV region for precise\nextraction of poles.\nMany attempts have also been made to tackle the Roper channel through Lattice QCD, but no definite conclusions\nhave been drawn despite significant efforts [515, 517, 824\u2013828]. More sophisticated lattice studies [284, 285] followed\nlater, consistently ruling out the exclusive qqqinterpretation of the Roper-resonance. Instead the sizable coupling to the\nfive-quark operators (meson-baryon states) is noted in Ref. [285]. In a recent lattice calculation, a multi-two-body-channel\nmodel was set up to extend the energy range up to the next excited state beyond the Roper [525]. Owing to different\navailable pion masses, resonance pole trajectories were mapped out.\nNotably, there is a missing level [284, 829, 830] when comparing to the expectation from elastic \u03c0Nscattering alone.\nThere are also further attempts based on Hamiltonian effective field theory (HEFT) [530] to interpret the measured\nfinite-volume spectrum [284]. The clean solution to analyzing the finite-volume spectrum of the Roper resonance lies in\ncorrectly including the three-body dynamics in form of the \u03c0\u03c0Ninelastic channels, see Ref. [831] for progress in this\ndirection. For progress of finite-volume three-body physics in general, see Sect. 2.11.3 and reviews [200, 241].\nIn Fig. 31 to the right, the region around\u221as=E\u22481.7 GeVis displayed in more detail. The figure shows, apart from\nsolutions A and B from the 2012 JBW analysis [53], the energy-dependent P11partial wave from Ref. [170] that was fitted\n(green dash-dotted lines). The SES (data) were notfitted. Nonetheless, fit B, and to some extent also A, do exhibit the\nstructure of the SES from Ref. [170] as the N(1710)moved to that position. In the 2012 JB analysis, the inclusion of the\nN(1710)became necessary for an entirely different reason, i.e., to improve the description of the \u03c0\u2212p\u2192K0\u039bdifferential\ncross section and polarization data. In Ref. [53], the unexpected repercussion for elastic \u03c0Nscattering was taken as\nstrong evidence for a resonance at this energy, and as a powerful demonstration how DCC approaches connect different\nreactions.\nThe existence of the N(1710)resonance has also been advocated for based on \u03b7Ndata [595]. While the existence of\nthis resonance is well established, nowadays the P11partial wave around that energy has served as a testing ground to\ndiscuss the role of complex threshold openings from three-body channels in baryon spectroscopy [195]. The starting point\nof this exercise is the smooth, energy-dependent P11amplitude from SAID or an older version of the JBW amplitude that\n53\n\nboth do not contain an N(1710)pole, but which both docontain the complex threshold opening of the \u03c1Nchannel (see\nFig. 14) at around the same energy, E=MN+E\u03c1where E\u03c1is the complex \u03c1(770)pole position. This amplitude is then\nfit with an early version of the Carnegie-Mellon-Berkeley type model developed by the Zagreb group [593\u2013596] which does\nnot contain this branch point, but which does contain resonances to fit amplitude structures. Indeed, the fit demands a\nresonance at E=(1698\u2212i130)MeVwhich simulates the branch point missing in that model. The exercise demonstrates\nthe need to explicitly include known non-analyticities like complex threshold openings in amplitude parametrizations, to\navoid false positives in baryon detection.\n3.4. Electroproduction reactions\nElectromagnetic probes of strongly interacting matter provide independent access to emergent phenomena of QCD such as\nresonances. Photoproduction reactions have been used to determine the spectrum and properties of excited baryons [539,\n540] as analyzed by different groups [54, 87, 605, 624, 625, 746, 752]. These analyses allow for a comparison to theory\nlike lattice QCD [265, 516\u2013518, 832\u2013838] or quark models [321, 323, 326, 329, 333, 821, 839\u2013842]. See Ref. [1] for a\nreview. Notably, first calculations of meson-baryon scattering amplitudes in lattice QCD have appeared recently, some of\nthem containing the \u2206(1232)3/2+resonance [520\u2013522, 843, 844]. Complementary to photoproduction reactions, radiative\ndecays of excited baryons, such as measured by CLAS [845\u2013851], can reveal information about the nature of the \u2206(1700)\nresonance [483] and the \u039b(1405)and\u039b(1520)hyperons [482, 486].\nIn addition, the momentum transfer of the probe can be tuned once the photon is allowed to become virtual, testing\nstrong interactions at different scales. Indeed, electroproduction reactions are a prime tool to study the structure of\nexcited baryons [351, 383, 384, 852, 853], but they also serve to discover new baryonic states [854] as discussed below.\nOne cannot directly test the response of a resonance to a virtual photon, but determine transition form factors (TFFs)\nin the electro-excitation of the resonance from the nucleon. One can also map out the transverse charge density by\nusing electromagnetic form factors [855]. The Q2-dependent multipoles can also be used to test calculations within\nchiral perturbation theory [856\u2013863] and unitary extensions [200, 478, 481], chiral resonance calculations [864, 865], quark\nmodels [337, 341, 359, 376, 866\u2013871] and other theory predictions [872\u2013875]. Notably, a chiral unitary framework for\nkaon electroproduction was developed in Ref. [38] and extended later [42, 43]. Transition form factors also serve as point\nof comparison for dynamical quark calculations referred to as Dyson-Schwinger approaches [402\u2013405, 410, 417, 876\u2013878].\nIn this context, remarkable agreement of the lower-lying baryon spectrum with predictions has been achieved [410, 878],\nshowing little evidence for a \u201cmissing resonance\u201d problem at lower energies. See Refs. [315, 378, 382, 399, 409] for reviews.\nMethods to study the Q2-dependence of resonance couplings in lattice QCD were proposed in Ref. [879]. A pioneering\nlattice calculation was carried out recently in the meson sector [880].\nTransitionformfactorshavebeendefinedindifferentways[382], buttheonlyreaction-independentdefinitionisgivenin\nterms of Q2-dependent couplings at the resonance pole, to be determined by an analytic continuation of electroproduction\nmultipoles [881]. We review the steps taken in the JBW model towards determining TFFs at resonance poles.\nThe multipoles themselves are determined by analyzing the exclusive electroproduction of one or more mesons. The\nadvantage of simultaneously analyzing different final states in a coupled-channel approach lies in the factoriziation of the\namplitude at the pole, i.e., the fact that the resonance TFF is the same for any final state, by construction.\nSingle-channel analyses of single-meson electroproduction data have a long history; one of the first approaches is MAID\nfor pion photo- and electroproduction [624, 882], later complemented by a chiral-MAID approach at low energies [714].\nThere is also the etaMAID2001 analysis on eta electroproduction [709]. See Ref. [883] for a review. The CLAS collabo-\nration extracted helicity amplitudes for several resonances from their experiment using two different methods, namely a\nunitary isobar model and an amplitude constructed with fixed-t dispersion relations, developed by Aznauryan [379, 884\u2013\n886]. One of the findings was the unusual zero in the A1/2Roper form factor. See also the analysis of Refs. [887\u2013889]\non the extraction of TFFs and their role in different reactions. See also Refs. [758, 768, 890\u2013892] for electroproduction\nanalyses using tree-level effective Lagrangian frameworks.\nQuestions on efficient parametrizations of electroproduction amplitudes and transition form factors are discussed in\nRefs. [352, 893\u2013895]. The two-pion electroproduction reaction has also been measured at CLAS [896\u2013901] and analyzed\nwith the JM reaction model [854, 887, 902, 903], see also Ref. [904]. Consistent results on N\u2217electroexcitation amplitudes\nobtained from independent studies of two major exclusive meson electroproduction channels in the resonance region, with\ndifferent non-resonant contributions \u03c0Nand\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212p, support the reliable extraction of these quantities.\nIn Ref. [854] the existence of a second N(1720)3/2+is claimed which would be the first resonance exclusively discovered\nin electroproduction. Notably, much higher Q2values for resonance transition form factors become accessible in ongoing\nCLAS12experiments[378,905]. Mostrelevantforthepresentanalysisof K\u039belectroproductionisKAON-MAID[712,906],\nan analysis using an effective Lagrangian approach [892], and the more recent analyses using a Regge-plus-resonance\namplitude [218, 907]. See Ref. [908] for an overview of kaon electroproduction reactions and Refs. [553, 783, 784, 788,\n791, 909, 910] for related analyses and theoretical developments by JPAC and others.\nThe data situation in electroproduction reactions is more challenging than in photoproduction. On the one hand, this\nis due to the presence of another kinematic variable in addition to the energy W, namely the virtuality of the photon\n54\n\nQ2=\u2212q2, where qis the transferred four-momentum of the photon. Even though the number of data points is larger\nin electro- than in photoproduction, the data are still sparser due to this additional variable. On the other hand, there\nare longitudinal multipoles to be determined from data, in addition to the electric and magnetic ones that parametrize\nthe photoproduction amplitudes. While there are in principle more spin observables than in photoproduction [706], fewer\nhave been measured than in photoproduction.\nHowever, the data situation is improving rapidly through new measurements with the CLAS12 detector [905, 911,\n912]. CLAS12 is the only available facility in the world capable of extending information on the evolution of the N\u2217\nelectroexcitation amplitudes towards Q2=10(GeV/c)2. The first measurements with the CLAS12 of inclusive (e, e\u2032X)\ncross sections [913] have revealed the presence of resonance structure in the second and third resonance regions, suggesting\npromising prospects for the extraction of N\u2217electroexcitation amplitudes within the range of Q2\u226410(GeV/c)2. The\ndevelopment of coupled channel approaches capable of extracting N\u2217electroexcitation amplitudes within that range\nrepresents an important and very needed direction in theory support of these ongoing experimental efforts.\nThe related question of how many measurements are necessary to determine a truncated partial-wave expansion of\nthe electroproduction amplitude is discussed in Refs. [687, 690].\nThe sparse data situation is another motivation for the simultaneous analysis of \u03c0N, \u03b7N, K \u039b, K\u03a3electroproduction\ndata, apart from the above mentioned property of amplitudes factorizing at resonance poles, improving the reaction-\nindependent extraction of TFFs. The available world data consists mostly of cross sections but includes also some\npolarization observables. A summary of the data is provided in the table in Fig. 32, most of them being included in the\nlatest JBW analysis [61]. Sometimes structure functions are extracted from cross sections in which case JBW analyzes\nonly the underlying cross sections. There are also data on K\u03a3electroproduction [846, 848, 850, 914], but they are not\nyet included in the JBW analysis.\nThe JBW group analyzed \u03c0N[59], \u03b7N[60], and, most recently, the combined \u03c0N,\u03b7N, and K\u039belectroproduction\ndata base [61]. Each time the maximal energy was increased requiring the inclusion of more and more partial waves,\ncurrently up to F-waves. The approach represents the first coupled-channel electroproduction analysis, while data at\nthe photon point ( Q2=0) are also included as a boundary condition from the JBW approach to pion [54], eta [55], and\nK\u039b[56] photoproduction [57] and pion-induced reactions [53, 104]. Specifically, the JBW electroproduction multipoles\nare constructed in close analogy to the photoproduction multipoles of Eq. (3.1),\nM\u2113,\u00b5\u03b3\u2217(p\u2032, E, Q2)=R\u2113\u2032(\u03bb, q/q\u03b3)\u239b\n\u239dV\u2113,\u00b5\u03b3\u2217(p\u2032, E, Q2)+\u2211\n\u03ba\u221e\n\u222b\n0dq q2T\u2113,\u00b5\u03ba(p\u2032, q;E)G\u03ba(q, E)V\u2113,\u03ba\u03b3\u2217(q, E, Q2)\u239e\n\u23a0,(3.16)\nforoutgoingmesonmomentum p\u2032, totalenergy E=\u221as, and \u03ba, \u00b5, \u03bd\u2208{\u03c0N, \u03b7N, K \u039b, \u03c0\u2206, \u03c1N}mesonbaryonchannels. Note\nthat there are no real or virtual photon couplings to the K\u03a3, \u03c3Nstates included, while the hadronic rescattering encoded\ninTdoes contain these channels. As no K\u03a3electroproduction data are analyzed yet, the input from the photoamplitude\nis taken from Ref. [56] which does not contain the analysis of K\u03a3photoproduction, either. The multipoles in Eq. (3.16)\nare formulated for a given angular momentum \u2113,M\u2113,\u00b5\u03b3\u2217\u2208{E\u2113, M\u2113, L\u2113}are the electroproduction multipoles. The G\u03ba\nare meson-baryon propagators (see Sects. 2.5 and 2.7.2); R\u2032\n\u2113is a barrier factor ensuring correct threshold behavior while\ntaming its high-momentum behavior. It depends on the photon momentum qandq\u03b3=q(Q2=0)[61]. For the connection\nof\u2113and\u2113\u2032see also Ref. [61]. The V\u00b5\u03b3\u2217are the Q2-dependent photon transitions such that for Q2=0they exactly match\nthe JB2017 photoproduction solution [56]. Note that longitudinal multipoles cannot be matched to photoproduction\ndata. Instead, a valuable constraint is provided through the long-wavelength limit encoded in the so-called Siegert\u2019s\ncondition [969, 970].\nApart from \u03c0and\u03b7electroproduction data, the JBW analyses [59\u201361] fit cross section data for \u03b3\u2217p\u2192K\u039bfrom\nCLAS. Notably, the data base was recently enlarged through the addition of beam-recoil transfer polarization data from\nCLAS [914]. This data is confronted (no fit) with the predictions of the JBW approach in Ref. [61], demonstrating the\nneed for further analysis. While the comparison of data and fit solutions of pion- and real-photon-induced reactions\nwith JB have been collected on a website [629], the JBW electroproduction solutions are collected on another interactive\nwebsite [802].\nAfter adjusting the amplitude parameters in the simultaneous to \u03c0N,\u03b7N, and K\u039belectroproduction data, results\nfor TFFs can be calculated. In the JBW coupled-channel approach, twelve N\u2217and\u2206transition form factors at the pole\nwere extracted recently in Ref. [626] using data with the center-of-mass energy from \u03c0Nthreshold to 1.8 GeV, and the\nphoton virtuality 0\u2264Q2/(GeV/c)2\u22648. For the \u2206(1232)andN(1440)states, the results are in qualitative agreement\nwith previous studies, while the transition form factors at the poles of some higher excited states are estimated for the\nfirst time. Since quarks are charged, the electroproduction probe can provide a spatial scan of the charge density \u03c1of,\ne.g.,p\u2192N\u2217transition in a certain reference frame [351, 971, 972]. This is shown in Fig. 33.\nIn the ANL-Osaka model the electroproduction data are analyzed by extending the model of the pion- and photon-\ninduced reactions.

The \u03b3\u2217N\u2192N\u2217helicity\namplitudes for P33, P11.S11, D13resonances are extracted and their Q2dependence and meson cloud effects are discussed.\nIn Ref.

Using the ANL-Osaka model [87], N\u2217\nhelicity amplitudes are determined in Ref. [92] for the Q2<3(GeV/c)2region. The parametrization of the bare helicity\namplitudes of the vector current are given in Appendix C of Ref. [92]. In this analysis, all available data of the single\npion electroproduction data and also empirical parametrization of the structure function Wem\n1, Wem\n2[973] are used.

Applications in neutrino physics\nNeutrino-induced reactions have recently received much attention in the context of long base-line experiments such as\nT2K, HK, DUNE [977\u2013979] and atmospheric neutrino data. To extract neutrino properties such as CP violation and the\n57\n\nneutrino mixing angle, the precise understanding of neutrino reactions in the GeV neutrino energy range plays a crucial\nrole [974, 980\u2013982]. For neutrino energies from around 1 GeV to a few GeV, meson production is the main mechanism of\nthe neutrino-nucleus reaction.\nIsobar models provide simple and useful parametrizations of neutrino reactions in the resonance region. The Rein-\nSehgal model [983, 984] has often been used in neutrino reaction generators. In this model, the amplitude is constructed\nusing Breit-Wigner forms for nucleon resonances with the masses, widths, and branching ratios from the PDG. Coupling\nconstants have been estimated with a relativistic quark model. Theoretical analyses from the 1970\u2019s, mainly for the\n\u2206(1232)region using isobar models and dispersion theory, are summarized in Ref. [985].\nThe model of Hern\u00e1ndez et al. [986\u2013988] (HNV model) includes the \u2206(1232)and non-resonant mechanisms from\nthe chiral Lagrangian. The vector form factors of the resonances are determined from the analysis of electron scattering\ndata. The model is improved to satisfy the requirement of unitarity using Watson\u2019s theorem for the single-pion production\nregion [989]. Several extensions of HNV including higher resonances such as N(1535)1/2\u2212,N(1440)1/2+andN(1520)3/2\u2212\nwere developed, for a detailed discussion see Ref. [990]. The model of neutrino-induced single-pion production [991] is a\nhybrid model based on the HNV approach for the low- Wregion and a reggeized, non-resonant amplitude based on the\nchiral Lagrangian for the higher W>2 GeVregion.\nFor energies above the \u2206(1232), many meson-baryon channels such as \u03c0N, \u03c0\u03c0N, \u03b7N, K \u039b, K\u03a3open up, rendering\nthe construction of a model for the multi-resonance and multi-channel neutrino reaction very challenging. The coupled-\nchannel approach is a way to construct such a model, which is constrained by the extensive data of pion-, photo- and\nelectro-production data. The first attempt along this line was made in Refs. [992, 993] for the \u2206resonance region, and\nthen the model was extended for W<2 GeVandQ2<3(GeV/c)2in Refs. [91, 92] based on the ANL-Osaka model. A\ncoupled-channel approach has also been used to study the strangeness-changing production of \u039b(1405)in antineutrino-\nproton interactions [994]. Below, we briefly review the current status of the ANL-Osaka coupled-channel model for\nneutrino reactions in the resonance region for strangeness-conserving processes.\nIn the Standard Model, the hadronic weak charged current (CC) and neutral current (NC) together with the electro-\nmagnetic current (EM) are given in terms of the vector ( V\u00b5) and axial ( A\u00b5) currents as\nJCC\n\u00b5(x)=Vud(V\u00b1\n\u00b5(x)\u2212A\u00b1\n\u00b5(x)), (3.17)\nJNC\n\u00b5(x)=(V3\n\u00b5(x)\u2212Vs\n\u00b5(x))\u2212(A3\n\u00b5(x)\u2212As\n\u00b5(x))\u22122 sin2\u03b8WJEM\n\u00b5(x), (3.18)\nJEM\n\u00b5(x)=V3\n\u00b5(x)+VIS\n\u00b5(x), (3.19)\nwhere the superscript \u00b1indicates the isospin raising (lowering) current, \u20193\u2019 is the third component of the isovector, and\n\u2019IS\u2019 is the isoscalar current. In the model, strange currents VsandAsare not taken into account.\nThe starting point of the neutrino-nucleon reaction model [92] is the ANL-Osaka model [87]. There, all model\nparameters that govern hadronic interactions are determined through the analysis of pion-, photon-, and electron-induced\nmeson-production reactions. The contributions of the individual isovector and isoscalar vector currents are obtained from\nthe analysis of the proton and deuteron reactions [88]. However, one still needs to fix the remaining unknown axial\ncurrent. The non-resonant axial current can be derived from a chiral Lagrangian on which the \u03c0Ninteraction potentials\nare based. By construction, the non-resonant axial current and the \u03c0Npotentials are related by the PCAC relation at\nQ2=0. The neutrino-induced forward reactions for various meson production channels, which are related to the \u03c0N\u2192X\nreaction are studied in Ref. [91]. The axial N-N\u2217transition strengths at Q2=0are related to the corresponding \u03c0NN\u2217\ncouplings via the PCAC relation. The advantage of the approach is that one can uniquely fix not only the axial coupling\nstrengths but also their phases. The Q2dependencies of the axial couplings are difficult to determine because of the\nlack of experimental information. Here, one assumes that all of the axial couplings have the dipole Q2dependence of\n1/(1+Q2/M2\nA)2with MA=1.026 GeV.\nThe total cross sections of \u03bd\u00b5induced CC single pion production on proton and neutron of the ANL-Osaka model\nand the HNV model are shown in Fig. 35 in comparison with the ANL [995, 996] and BNL [997] data. The final state\nof\u03bdp\u2192l\u2212\u03c0+pis a purely isospin 3/2amplitude, therefore, a large part of the cross section is due to the \u2206(1232), while\n\u03bdn\u2192l\u2212\u03c0+nand\u03bdn\u2192l\u2212\u03c00pcontain the contribution of the I=1/2amplitude. Both models agree reasonably well, while\nthey both lie slightly above the data in the 1\u22122 GeVregion. For \u03bdn\u2192l\u2212\u03c0+n, the discrepancies between the two models\nare larger in the high-energy region. The experimental data are obtained from the analysis of \u03bddreactions. Effects of the\nfinal state interaction and deuteron wave function within the ANL-Osaka model are studied in Refs. [998, 999], and are\nfound to enhance the cross section at the quasi-elastic peak by 10% to 30% for the \u03bdn\u2192\u00b5\u2212\u03c0+nchannel.\nThe mechanism of pion production can be closely examined by the angular distribution of the pion.

Therefore, the D\u2217andE\u2217terms should have a similar size as the A\u2217, B\u2217, C\u2217terms.\nThe excitation spectrum of the neutrino-induced single-pion production reaction d\u03c3/dW\u03c0Nis shown in Fig. 37. The\ndata are taken from the CERN bubble chamber BEBC [1000]. For comparison, the cross section is calculated using\nthe ANL-Osaka model at E\u03bd=50 GeVand the normalization is adjusted for the \u03bd\u00b5p\u2192\u00b5\u2212\u03c0+preaction. The reaction\n\u03bd\u00b5p\u2192\u00b5\u2212\u03c0+pis dominated by the \u2206(1232), while for the other reactions isospin I=1/2structures are important in the\nhigh W\u03c0Nregion. Also note that for the \u03bd\u00b5n\u2192\u00b5\u2212\u03c0+nchannel, the strength of N\u2217resonances is significant.\nInclusive double-differential cross sections d\u03c3/dW/dQ2for the neutron target carry important physical information.\nThe result is shown in Fig. 38. There, the prominent peak due to the \u2206(1232)has a long tail toward the high Q2region.\nContributions of the second resonance region are also seen in the single-pion production cross section. A similar contour\nplot is shown for double-pion productions. The situation looks very different from the single-pion production case. The\nmain contributions are from the second and the third resonance region.\nThe ANL-Osaka model of the neutrino-induced meson production reaction is constrained from the experimental data\nof pion-, photon-, and electron-induced reactions as far as possible. However, there is a limitation on the axial vector\ncurrent to data-driven phenomenological models because of the lack of experimental data. Except for the \u2206(1232)region,\nall of the existing models for the neutrino-induced meson production reactions use assumptions on the Q2dependence\nof the axial vector current such as the dipole form factor discussed before. The predicted CC structure functions Fifor\nhigh Q2of the reaction model are known to miss strength in comparison with the parton model even though the model\npredicts reasonably well for EM structure functions. Possible effects to improve the situation by modifying the axial\nform factors are discussed in Ref. [990].

DCC approaches for strangeness systems\nGenerally, the spectrum of excited hyperons ( Y\u2217) is much less known than that of non-strange excited nucleons ( N\u2217and\n\u2206). This is mostly owed to the fact that experiments with open strangeness are harder to conduct because the reaction\nparticipants decay quickly. However, some options exist, such as using secondary Kaon beams, as proposed for example\nin the upcoming KLF experiment [1001], and in ongoing and planed experiments at J-PARC [632, 1002, 1003]. Regarding\nthe latter, for example, spectroscopy of \u039ehyperons (P97), of \u2126baryons (P86), access to the region below \u00afKNthreshold\n(\u039b(1405)) [1004] (E31), measurements of a missing-mass spectrum near the \u03a3Nthreshold (\u201c \u03a3Ncusp\u201d) [1005] (E90), as\nwell as a study of the \u03b7\u039bfinal state [1006] (E72) are on the agenda. Future measurements in this direction are also\ndiscussed for the AMBER experiment [1007, 1008] and as an opportunity for SIS100@FAIR [1009]. Another alternative is\nto use photo-induced reactions and separating a third particle (spectator) carrying one unit of strangeness away as in the\nCLAS experiment [1010]. Also, multi-step decays of charmed states as in the Belle analysis of the \u039e\u2212\u03c0+invariant mass\nspectrum [1011] carry new information. See the recent review by Crede and Yelton [1012]. There is also the femtoscopic\nmethodology employed for example by the ALICE collaboration [1013], see the review [586]. In the latter cases the\ntheoretical analysis is complicated by the less known systematics in the creation mechanism of the open-strangeness\nconfigurations. For a critical discussion see Ref. [1014]. Obviously, the situation becomes even more complicated if one is\ninterested in higher-strangeness states, and even less is known there regarding the resonance spectrum. For more details\nand other options see recent reviews [200, 503, 585, 1015].\nTheoretically, the by far largest interest in this field was generated from chiral perturbation theory and unitarization\ntechniques such as described in Sect. 3.3.6. Specifically, CHPT is derived from QCD by integrating out heavy degrees of\nfreedom. Interaction patterns of this Effective Field Theory for the meson-baryon scattering are used then in a unitarized\napproach to extend the region of applicability to a resonance region. Overall, the inclusion of chiral symmetry and\nS-matrix principles constrains the amplitudes such that predictions can be made outside of the data region leading for\nexample to a prediction of the second isoscalar pole of the \u039b(1405), for more details see reviews [200, 585, 1015]. We\nrestrict ourselves in the following to the context of DCC models only.\nMost of the past partial wave analyses for investigating Y\u2217resonances were performed using the Breit-Wigner\nparametrization. An analysis aiming at the extraction of the poles and their residue of the partial wave amplitudes\nwas presented only more recently [1016]. In the multi-channel K-matrix method, the K\u2212preactions were analyzed in\nRefs. [1017, 1018] (KSU). In Ref. [1019], the amplitudes of Refs. [1017, 1018] are used to extract resonance parameters.\nThe Bonn-Gatchina (BnGa) group analyzed the strangeness sector with their K-matrix approach, describing not only\ntwo but also three-body final states. Resonance parameters were extracted in Refs. [1020\u20131022].\nIn DCC approaches, two-body meson-baryon interactions consist of s-,t- and u-channel hadron exchange mechanism\nas described in section Sect. 2. The data on K\u2212preactions were analyzed by the Juelich group [16, 276] and, recently, by\nthe ANL-Osaka group [94, 95]. In the Juelich approach to the KN[1023, 1024] and \u00afKN[16] interactions, most of the\nparameters of the model are constrained from SU(3) flavor symmetry. Additional parameters are fixed from the analysis\nofKNand \u00afKNelastic and inelastic cross section data that existed at the time. The channels included for negative\nstrangeness are \u03c0\u039b,\u03c0\u03a3, and \u00afKN.

[95].\nANL-Osaka model [94] and the KSU model [1017] are unpolarized differential and total cross sections and polarization\nobservables of the K\u2212p\u2192\u00afKN, \u03c0 \u03a3, \u03c0\u039b, \u03b7\u039b, K\u039ereactions. In addition, the ANL-Osaka group also studied strangeness\nproduction on the deuteron [1025]. In Ref. [1022] by the BnGa group, \u03c9\u039band the three-body final states K\u2212p\u2192\n\u03c00\u03c00\u039b, \u03c00\u03c00\u03a3are included in the fits as well. In the work of the ANL-Osaka group [94], two solutions (model A and\nmodel B) have been obtained which have quite different values for the model parameters, while both models fitting the\nK\u2212pdata only have similar quality of data description. Results for the energies of Y\u2217resonances from model A, B [95]\nand KSU [1017] show excellent agreement for several states. However, in some cases large discrepancies are also seen,\nmirroring the fact that the existing K\u2212pdata are not yet sufficient to constrain the mass spectrum of Y\u2217. The S01(1/2\u2212)\nresonance around 1.67GeV has a large contribution to the total cross section of K\u2212p\u2192\u03b7\u039bas shown in the left panel\nof Fig. 39. The situation is similar to the total cross section of \u03c0\u2212p\u2192\u03b7nand the role of S11(1535). Around the \u03b7\u039b\nthreshold region, model B additionally predicts a narrow P-wave resonance P03(3/2+)atE=1671+2\n\u22128\u2212i(5+11\n\u22122)MeV. This\nresonance couples strongly with \u03b7\u039b. About 40% of the peak of the total cross section is due to this P03resonance in\nmodel B, while the S01(1670)resonance dominates the peak of the cross section in model A. The difference between the\nmodel A and model B shows up in the angular distribution of \u03b7\u039bas shown in Fig. 39 suggesting that the data of angular\ndistribution seems to favor the p-wave contribution and resonance in model B.\nFor both models also the branching ratios of the Y\u2217resonances are determined. They are depicted in Fig. 40. The\nresults show large branching ratios to \u03c0\u03a3\u2217and \u00afK\u2217Nstates for higher-energy resonances, suggesting the importance to\nestablish those resonance from the data of three-body reactions KN\u2192\u03c0\u03c0\u039b, \u03c0\u00afKN. For some cases, see, e.g., the lowest\n\u039b 1/2\u2212or1/2+states, both models predict not only similar masses but also similar coupling to different channels. Less\npronounced agreement in some other cases indicates the need for more precise data to pin down the properties of the\nhyperons. This again emphasizes the importance of experimental updates [1001, 1007\u20131009] discussed at the beginning\nof this section.\n61\n\n4. Three-meson systems: the ANL-Osaka and IVU models\nThe previous discussion of excited baryons has shown that the elastic energy window is usually small, making it necessary\nto consider coupled channels and three or more body dynamics. Indeed, already the first excited state of the nucleon, the\nRoper-resonance N\u2217(1440)1/2+, is above the \u03c0\u03c0Nthreshold, decaying substantially into effective three-body channels\nf0(500)Nand\u03c0\u2206causing the unusual line shape of that resonance [53, 496, 544, 598]. Some resonances like the a1(1260)\nmeson decay overwhelmingly into three particles [103]. The same is expected for the lightest meson with exotic spin-parity\nquantum numbers, JPC=1\u2212+, the \u03c01(1600)that was found by COMPASS [1026]. This state is currently a subject of\nextensive experimental and theoretical investigations [1027, 1028], see also Refs. [199, 1029] for recent reviews. Three-\nbody effects can also be relevant for the other exotic candidates, like the X(3872)[1030], the Y(4260)[1031], or the\nT+\ncc(3875) [1032, 1033] observed in the charmonium spectrum close to various three-body thresholds.\nInexperimentalanalyses, thedescriptionofthree-bodyfinalstateswithunitaryisobaramplitudeshasmadesubstantial\nprogress recently. See Refs. [123, 126, 130, 1034\u20131041] for formal developments. In close conceptual connection to\nRefs. [134, 142] highlighted in this section, in Ref. [1042] a three-body unitary coupled-channel framework was used to\nanalyze KSKS\u03c00Dalitz plot pseudodata for the JPC=0\u2212+amplitude in the J/\u03c8\u2192\u03b3KSKS\u03c00decay related to the\ncontroversial \u03b7(1405/1475), extracting also the associated resonance poles. That framework is conceptually related to\nthe pioneering work by the ANL-Osaka group [1043, 1044]. The final-state interaction of three pions in the decays of\na1(1260), \u03c02(1670), \u03c02(2100)andD0and also the photon-induced three pion production is investigated in DCC. The\nrole of particle-exchange interaction (Z diagram) needed for three-body unitarity is demonstrated for the Dalitz plot, the\nphase of the decay amplitudes, and the extraction of resonance pole and residue. See also Refs. [165, 1040] for other\nunitary three-body coupled-channel applications. Ref. [165] is an attempt of a unified description of the various final\nstates in e+e\u2212\u2192c\u00afcsimilar to the N\u2217analysis with DCC.\nThree-body rescattering effects can also be quantified using Khuri-Treimann (KT) equations and in similar frameworks\nby the Bonn group, JPAC, and others for light meson decays [126, 1034, 1036, 1045\u20131065]. Faddeev-type arrangements of\nchiral two-body amplitudes were used to predict resonance states and to study known ones [496, 499, 1066\u20131069]. See also\nRef. [1070] for a pedagogical introduction into dispersive methods and Ref. [1071] for connections between Khuri-Treiman\nequations and three-body unitary methods. We also highlight Ref. [1072] in which KT and Omn\u00e8s-functions for the\ntwo-body part were used to study \u03c0\u03c1rescattering in close relation to the physical systems discussed in this review.\nIn experiments producing excited baryons there is often a well-defined initial state such as \u03c0N,\u00afKN, or\u03b3(\u2217)N. This\nusually simplifies modeling the production mechanisms. For example, in elastic \u03c0Nscattering or pion-induced meson-\nbaryon production, there is no need to model the production mechanism separately from the coupled-channel rescattering,\nat all. Sometimes, however, the production mechanism is not fully known as in the study of excited mesons with three-\nbody channels. In some cases, like semi-leptonic \u03c4decays, the production via a highly virtual gauge boson filters quantum\nnumbers of the three-meson system, like in case of the a1[134]. In high-energy experiments, on the other hand, many\npartial waves are simultaneously excited through complicated production mechanisms. One way of dealing with the\ndependence of results on the production mechanism is to kinematically divide it and check if the results depend, e.g., on\nthe Mandelstam variable tbins [1073]. See Ref. [223] for a review on COMPASS physics.\nIn the pertinent experimental analyses of three-body final states, the traditional \u201cisobar model\u201d employs line shapes\n(isobars) for the final 2-body correlations in the decay, without explicit three-body rescattering effects, e.g., at Crystal\nBarrel [1074] (includes coupled channels), BESIII [1075], Belle [1076], and LHCb [1077]. Diagrammatically, this would\ncorrespond (but not be equal) to the first term in the second line of Fig. 11: There is a complex \u201cpartial-wave amplitude\u201d\nthat is fit to events, and that couples to spectators and isobars which subsequently decay into asymptotically stable states\n- no explicit final-state interaction and no coupled channels. Both effects are, at least partially, absorbed into the complex\npartial wave. Recently, the COMPASS collaboration significantly advanced the analysis of the three-pion spectrum [223,\n1073] by performing independent partial-wave decompositions in sub-energy bins of the two-pion subsystems, i.e., without\nusing fixed isobar line shapes [1078]. If the isobar is \u201cfreed\u201d in this way, the amplitude is general enough that three-body\neffects like rescattering and coupled channels can be accommodated. In contrast, the three-body methods discussed in\nthis review parametrize these effects explicitly, with the consequence that the production vertex D(see Fig. 11) is always\nreal and does not contain physical resonance information by itself.\nFromatheoreticalpointofviewonecanarguethatmanifestlyimplementingcoupledchannelsandunitaritycorrections\nin the amplitude allows for a better understanding of these effects, and, in the future, these amplitudes might even be\nused to analyze data directly. In addition, there are kinematic effects like triangle singularities (TS) which cannot easily\nbe accommodated in simple isobar models. However, these effects naturally arise as coupled-channel effect (with unequal\nmasses) in DCC approaches [157] as illustrated in the last diagram of Fig. 11. We briefly review recent developments in\nthis respect in Sect. 4.3.\nIn this review, we report on the development and applications of unitary DCC amplitude with explicit rescattering\nand coupled channels related in concept and formalism to the previously discussed DCC approaches. The previously\ndiscussed baryonic JBW models focus on phenomenological aspects and data analysis from experiment by starting from\nsome phenomenological Lagrangian. In contrast to this, mesonic three-body DCC approaches are sometimes related\n62\n\nW\u2212/a1(1260)\u03bd\u03c4\u03c0+(q3)\u03c0\u2212(q1/2)\u03c0\u2212(q1/2)\u03c4Figure 41: Factorization of the (weak) production mechanism and (hadronic) final state three-body interaction in semileptonic \u03c4decays.\nFull-directed, dashed, and double lines denote leptons, mesons and auxiliary \u03c1fields, respectively.

[142].\nto finite-volume methods for the mapping of lattice-QCD energy eigenvalues to the physical scattering amplitudes in\ninfinite volume. In particular, the Finite-Volume Approach (FVU) discussed in Sect. 2.11.3 uses the concept of three-\nbody unitarity [130] discussed in Sect. 2.7.1 to construct a finite-volume amplitude in which spurious singularities cancel\nsystematically in an interplay of disconnected and connected contributions, and exchange singularities with propaga-\ntion singularities [253]. We, therefore, call the corresponding amplitudes discussed here infinite-volume unitary (IVU)\napproaches. While finite-volume physics is not the focus of this review [241, 242, 1079], it should be mentioned that\nalternative method exists, referred to as the RFT approach [258, 1080]. Here, several three-body systems of excited\nmesons were formulated [1081, 1082] including the unequal mass case of Refs. [138, 294] and Ref. [296] ( \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0andK\u00afK\u03c0\nchannels), as well the solution of integral equations in this context [290].\nIn Sect. 4.1 we report the two-channel approaches of Refs. [142, 164] in which, for the first time, a three-body\nresonance pole was extracted from data with a unitary amplitude. In Sect. 4.2 a recent extension to the unequal mass\ncase is discussed for a nine-channel amplitude containing pions and kaons [113]. The unequal-mass case can also lead to\nthe formation of so-called triangle singularities in the physical region. While this is a long-known issue evaluated at the\none-loop level, triangle singularities can also be understood as off-diagonal channel transitions of a three-body unitarized\namplitude. Recent developments in this direction are discussed in Sect. 4.3.\n4.1. A two-channel model for the a1(1260 )meson\nA DCC amplitude with manifest three-body unitarity (referred to as infinite-volume unitary, IVU) was developed in\nRef. [134] for the two coupled partial waves (\u03c0\u03c1)Sand(\u03c0\u03c1)Dto study the a1(1260)resonance. This amplitude was later\nreformulated for the finite volume to perform the first extraction of a three-body resonance from lattice QCD data [164].\nThe analytic continuation of the amplitude to the a1(1260)resonance pole was explained in detail in Ref. [142] and,\nfor the first time, the pole of that resonance was determined from experimental data using the continuation techniques\ndiscussed in Sect. 2.9.3.\nSee also Ref. [1083] for an extraction of the a1(1260)resonance pole with an approximately unitarity amplitude. The\na1(1260)resonance can also decay to the \u03c0\u03c3channel and the branching ratio to this subdominant channel was estimated\nin Ref. [1084]. Different parametrizations for the a1meson and consequences for observables were studied in Ref. [1085].\nA model that systematically includes S- and P-wave isobars and also strangeness channels was formulated in Ref. [113]\nand is discussed in Sect. 4.2, but it has not yet been applied to a physical system.\nComing back to the a1(1260)resonance, it couples to three-pion states in the IG(JPC)=1\u2212(1++)channel that can\nbe decomposed as \u03c0\u03c1inS/D-wave, \u03c0\u03c3and\u03c0(\u03c0\u03c0)I=2inP-waves and other channels. Phenomenologically, the channel\n(\u03c0\u03c1)Sis dominant [1086], with the branching ratios into other channels being quite uncertain [103]. The semileptonic \u03c4\ndecay leading to the a1formation is shown in Fig. 41. The starting point to formulate the hadronic final-state interaction\nis, again, the connected production amplitude \u02dc\u0393from Eq. (2.8.2) plus the disconnected part Djthat we refer to as a\n\u201cbare\u201d production mechanism in the sense that it is a real, energy and momentum-dependent function in the physical\nregion. The index jstands for the two channels (\u03c0\u03c1)Sand(\u03c0\u03c1)D. The production vertices Djcontain a regular piece\nand a first-order pole in the three-body energy\u221as[142], similar to Eq. (3.2) for photoproduction. That pole cancels with\na corresponding zero in the rescattering part just like for the photoproduction case. Also, there is now a nonzero contact\nterm in rescattering, Cfrom Eq. (2.83). It contains the same singularity. This corresponds to VPin baryon amplitudes,\nsee Eq. (2.59). Together, the matching singularities in DandCprovide a flexible way to parametrize the a1(1260). Also,\nboth DandCcontain regular, real-valued terms that can depend on three-body energy\u221asand spectator momentum p.\nAll these parts contain fit parameters that can be adjusted to data. Note the formal similarity of the overall amplitude\nto the photo and electroproduction amplitude in DCC model, see Eq. (3.16). In particular, the production amplitude has\nthe same structure as the \u201cdressed resonance creation vertex\u201d in Eq. (2.63), consisting of a direct/disconnected piece and\na rescattering/connected piece.\n63\n\nTo connect the production amplitude to the observable \u03c0\u2212\u03c0\u2212\u03c0+state in \u03c4decays, the angular dependence is introduced\ninto the production process\n(\u0393related to Eq.

For consistency, it should be mentioned that in Eq. (2.90) and in\nRef. [113] that vertex is absorbed in the definition of \u02d8\u0393while in\n(\u0393of Eq. (4.1) it is not, following the notation of Ref. [142].\nFinally, the amplitude has to be symmetrized to account for indistinguishable particles.

Data resampling\nresults in the small blue dots that can be used to determine an error ellipse shown in light blue, even though the fit\nproblem is obviously not very linear (i.e., the most probable value is not in the center but at the margin of the ellipse).\nSystematic uncertainties, shown with the light green rectangle, were determined by varying the cutoff \u039bin a wide range\nwhile re-fitting all other parameters. This shows that the parametrization is consistent and cutoff changes can be well\nabsorbed in changing the contact C-terms.\nIn Ref. [142] the role of the pion exchange term was also tested (see also Eq. (4.8) below). The fit quality without this\nterm changes little, but the most probable pole position, shown with the open red circle in Fig. 42, changes significantly\ncompared to the uncertainties. This demonstrates that the exchange process, demanded by three-body unitarity [130],\ndoes have an influence and should be taken into account when determining resonance poles from data.\n4.2.

This is in contrast to previous IVU works for excited mesons [134, 142, 164] but also\nthe previously discussed JBW approach for excited mesons. There, Lagrangians were used to calculate isospin coefficients\nfor transitions Bthat partly contain an isospin structure from the isobar propagation \u03c4, see the discussion in Appendix\nA of Ref. [113]. In particular, the isospin coefficients in Ref. [113] are obtained simply by\n\u02dcIF=\u2211\nm,n\nm\u2032,n\u2032(IIn ISm\u2223II3)(II\u2032n\u2032IS\u2032m\u2032\u2223II3)(Ixn\u2212m\u2032ISm\u2223II\u2032n\u2032)(Ixn\u2212m\u2032IS\u2032m\u2032\u2223IIn),for\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0only, (4.7)\nwhere II(II\u2032) is the isospin of the incoming (outgoing) isobar, IS(IS\u2032) is the isospin of the incoming (outgoing) spectator,\nandIxis the isospin of the exchanged particle. Figure 43 shows the label assignments for the example of \u03c0\u03c1\u2192\u03c0\u03c1\ntransition. The calculation is slightly more intricate in the presence of kaons as one has to adopt a convention of how\nparticles with strangeness are ordered. The logic of Eq. (4.7) can be illustrated as follows. The two-body input of the\ncurrent formalism are isobar amplitudes in the isospin basis. To construct the particle exchange, one needs to first \u201cunfold\u201d\nthese amplitudes to the particle/charge basis (third and fourth coefficient). One then has to sum over all possible particle\nexchanges. Finally, one needs to construct total isospin states (first and second coefficient). The particle phases [102]\nassociated with \u03c0+and\u03c1+always cancel in the process. To demonstrate the angular dependence of isobars with spin, the\nexchange transitions with the labeling of Fig. 43 read in the helicity basis:\n\u02dcBji(s,p\u2032,p)=(\u02dcIF)jiv\u2217\nj(p, P3\u2212p\u2212p\u2032)vi(p\u2032, P3\u2212p\u2212p\u2032)\n2Ep\u2032+p(\u221as\u2212Ep\u2212Ep\u2032\u2212Ep\u2032+p)+i\u03f5for i, j\u2208HB, (4.8)\nwith the angular structures of P- and S-wave isobars,\nvi(p, q)=\u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9gi(p\u2212q)\u00b5\u03f5\u00b5(p+q, \u03bb)for\u2113=1isobars,\n1 for\u2113=0isobars,(4.9)\nwith polarization state vectors \u03f5, for exact definitions see Ref. [112]. Note that the presence of the vector meson coupling\nto pseudoscalar mesons, gi, is due to the particular representation of the two-body amplitude with explicit isobars [113].\nIn contrast, the \u2113=0isobars are not parametrized with isobars. While the same is possible for \u2113=1isobars, the angular\ndependence of the vector isobar channel is always moved inside the definition of \u02dcBbecause that is the object undergoing\npartial-wave projection according to Sect. 2.5.\nAnother issue concerns symmetry factors as explained in Sect. II D of Ref. [113]. The amplitude entering the prop-\nagation \u02dc\u03c4, together with the adjacent angular structure in case of P-wave isobars corresponds to the full, plane-wave,\n2-body amplitude that no longer absorbs any symmetry factors in its definition. This is potentially an issue, because it is\noften customary (e.g., in many chiral unitary approaches) to absorb symmetry factors from the two-body propagation of\nidentical particles \u2013 pions count as identical in the isospin basis \u2013 into the definition of two-body states (e.g., Ref. [194]),\nor the partial-wave projected amplitudes in case of the Inverse Amplitude Method (e.g., Ref. [191]). In contrast, note\nthat the self-energy integral of Eq. (2.82) explicitly contains the symmetry factor of 1/2for identical particles, where it\nbelongs. The detailed procedure to match different two-body amplitudes from the literature to \u02dc\u03c4as input for three-body\ncalculations is given in Ref. [113].\nThe next step in the amplitude construction consists in determining the isobars from two-body scattering data. In\nthe scalar-isoscalar ( f0) channel, there are not only data for the \u03c0\u03c0phase shifts, but also for the \u03c0\u03c0\u2192K\u00afKtransition and\nthe inelasticity \u03b70\n0that determine the coupled-channel isobar amplitude. With all input available the integral equation\nfor the production amplitude can be calculated either by direct inversion (Sect. 2.8.2), contour deformation (Sect. 2.8),\nor continued fractions [157]. For contour deformation, one needs to analytically continue the amplitude to real spectator\nmomenta as described in Sect. 2.8.1. In Ref. [113] it is checked that this method and direct inversion lead to the same\nresult.\nIn Fig. 44 the production amplitude \u02d8\u0393from Eq. (2.90) is shown for different choices of \u201cbare\u201d production vertices D\nin different channels. The blue highlighted regions correspond to the \u201ccritical region\u201d shown in Fig. 10 to the left. The\nfact that the amplitude exhibits a smooth behavior and transition to the noncritical region demonstrates the validity of\nthe Cahill and Sloan method discussed in Sect. 2.8.\n66\n\n0.00.20.40.60.81.0\n2 3 4 50.00.10.20.30.42 3 4 5 6\n0.00.20.40.60.81.0\n2 3 4 50.00.10.20.30.42 3 4 5 6Figure 44: Production amplitude \u2223\u02d8\u0393\u22232(unitless for all channels) in terms of the isobar invariant mass.

[113].\nIn Fig. 44, to the left, we show the complete production amplitude \u02d8\u0393from Eq. (2.90) including the disconnected part,\nthe final isobar propagation, and its decay. Consequently, one observes the \u03c1and\u03c3line shapes, but not the f0(980)\nline shape, due to the chosen energy being\u221as=7m\u03c0. The dashed lines show the disconnected part alone. This would\ncorrespond to the traditional isobar model, in which line shapes are related to two-body scattering amplitudes only. The\nsolid lines show the full, three-body unitary amplitude \u2223\u02d8\u0393\u22232, including coupled channels and rescattering. There is a\nnoticeable modifications of the line shapes by these effects, at some invariant masses. We observe a distortion of the \u03c3\nmeson towards smaller invariant masses and similarly moderate changes for the other channels.\nIf one chooses the input for the production vertex Dfdifferently, one obtains different line shapes as shown in Fig. 44\nto the right. Of course, there is additional freedom in the amplitude that will further modify the line shapes. This refers\nto the isobar-spectator contact terms Cin Eq. (2.83). These terms encode three-body resonance dynamics [142] and\nother QCD effects, and they have all been set to zero in Ref. [113] for simplicity. In summary, the work from Ref. [113]\ndemonstrates how rescattering, coupled channels, three-body forces C, and the relative strengths of the production\nprocesses Dall lead to modifications of the traditional isobar line shapes.\n4.3. Triangle singularities as channel transitions in DCC approaches\nThree-body effects can be enhanced by a kinematical effect known as triangle singularity (TS) [167]. It sometimes occurs\nin the decay of a resonance to an intermediate resonance and a spectator. In a specific kinematic region one of the decay\nproducts of the intermediate resonance can \u201ccatch up\u201d with the spectator. This on-shell condition produces a bump in\nthe invariant mass spectrum of these two particles, without any resonance being responsible for it [1088\u20131092]. See also\nRefs. [1093, 1094] for the conceptual treatment of TS. The a1(1420), was at first claimed to be a new resonance while\nposterior analyses suggested that a TS effect can take place in the decay chain a1(1260)\u2192K\u2217\u00afK\u2192K\u00afK\u03c0\u2192f0\u03c0\u21923\u03c0\nresultinginapeakinthe 3\u03c0mass 0.2 GeVabovethenominal a1mass[167,1095,1096],seealsoRefs.[167,1094,1097,1098]\nfor general discussions. See Refs. [1099\u20131101] for further examples of TS. The exact position of the TS can also be used\nto determine the mass of an exotic state close to a three-body threshold when the decay channel of the exotic particle is\nmediated by a TS [1102, 1103].\nIn the context of DCC approaches, triangle singularities are nothing but enhanced hadron exchanges between channels\nof unequal masses. An example is given by the diagram in Fig. 11 to the lower right: In a system of pions and kaons that\ninteract strongly, the above-mentioned K\u2217\u00afK\u2192K\u00afK\u03c0\u2192f0\u03c0transition is clearly visible as kaon exchange in an infinite\nrescattering series. Qualitatively, at around\u221as\u22481.42 GeVthe quasi-on-shell K\u2217and the kaon spectator are on-sell at the\nmomentum of the exchanged kaon flying in backwards direction, thus being able to \u201ccatch up\u201d with the kaon spectator\nand form an f0as if it were a classical kinematic process. That kinematic point is given as pPfrom Eq. (2.89). This\nenhancement of processes that are allowed in classical kinematics is referred to as Coleman-Norton theorem [1088].\nThe role of TS in dynamical coupled channel approaches has been recently discussed in depth in Ref. [157]. Using\nthe IVU formalism [130] the question was studied whether the appearance of triangle singularities is affected by an\ninfinite series of rescattering of final two- and three-body final states. It was found that the position of the triangle\nsingularity is not affected through the final-state rescattering. This is in full agreement with the argument provided by\nthe generalization of the Landau equations [1090, 1104, 1105] to include rescattering effects. Specifically, it was found\n67\n\nthat inclusion of higher topologies (triangle \u00d7box, triangle \u00d7box\u00d7box etc.) leads either to non-singular configurations\nor provides a sub-leading singularity through a factorization into the triangle diagram and the rest that is non-singular.\nA first estimate of the size of the effect due to rescattering was carried out and found to be quite small. Clearly, some\napproximations were made, neglecting the full spin/isospin structure for the a1(1420)system, but the driving effect for\nthe smallness of the rescattering effect seems to lie in the particular size of the coupling constants, fixed mostly by the\nmass and the width of the K\u2217andf0(980)resonances. This explains a different observation of Ref. [1042] where the\nrescattering effects for the \u03b7(1405/1475)are found to be more important. It seems that the general path forward is to\nalways include all rescattering effects and let data decide whether rescattering is relevant or not.\n5. Coupled-channel baryon-baryon systems\nThe by far best studied baryon-baryon ( BB) system, experimentally as well as theoretically, is the nucleon-nucleon ( NN)\nsystem. However, in most theoretical investigations coupled-channel effects do not really play an role. It has to do with\nthe fact that the threshold of the next BBchannel ( N\u2206(1232)) is separated by roughly 300 MeV , see Fig. 45. Moreover,\nthere is no coupling between S-wave states. Such a coupling can only occur with the \u2206\u2206channel whose threshold is\nanother 300 MeV higher up. Indeed, the first channels that opens is that of the three-body system NN\u03c0and\u03c0dat\nabout 140 MeV . Near threshold a perturbative treatment of the \u03c0production is possible [1106] because at low momenta\nthe\u03c0Ninteraction is weak due to constraints from chiral symmetry. However, at intermediate energies one faces the\nchallenge of treating the NN\u03c0three-body system (and eventually the NN\u03c0\u03c0system) and its coupling to NNrigorously\n[1107, 1108]. Thus, most of the NNpotentials in the literature are designed to describe and reproduce the NNscattering\ndata only up to the pion-production threshold. Nonetheless, there is a considerable number of NNpotentials where the\n\u2206resonance is included as explicit degree of freedom and where the coupling to the N\u2206and/or \u2206\u2206systems is taken into\naccount, for example in Refs. [1109\u20131112]. An extensive overview and references to the pertinent literature is given in\nRef. [1113]. In some of the potentials established within the meson-exchange approach \u2206\u2019s are only included in order to\nachieve more realistic values for model parameters like the meson-baryon coupling constants [48], whereas in others the\nmotivation is indeed to describe NNphenomenology up to and even beyond the thresholds involving the \u2206resonance\n[1109, 1110, 1114]. As a matter of facts, the influence of the coupling of the NNsystem to the N\u2206channel on some NN\nphase shifts like the1D2or3F3has been long established by phase-shift analyses but also by model calculations.\nAlso in modern approaches to the BBinteraction like chiral effective field theory (EFT) the inclusion of the \u2206has\nbeen considered from the very beginning [1115]. Among others, it has been found to improve the convergence in peripheral\nNNphases [1116, 1117]. But like in some phenomenological NNpotentials mentioned above, \u2206\u2019s are not an active degree\nof freedom and the calculations are restricted to energies below the NN\u03c0threshold. Anyway, the dynamics around the\nN\u2206threshold and possible coupled-channels effects are beyond the validity of the present chiral potentials and cannot\nbe addressed.\nThe kinematical situation is different for BBsystems involving strange baryons. In case of strangeness S=\u22121there\nare two channels involving octet baryons, \u039bNand\u03a3N, while for S=\u22122there are even four channels, \u039b\u039b,\u039eN,\u039b\u03a3and\n\u03a3\u03a3. In the limit of SU(3) flavor symmetry their thresholds coincide. SU(3) symmetry is, of course, broken, but even\nfor physical masses the separation between the thresholds remains small as can be seen from the overview provided in\nFig. 45. Thus, for a realistic description of the dynamics of Y Nsystems the explicit inclusion of the channel coupling is\nindispensable. Indeed, already in the first attempts to establish a potential for the S=\u22121sector the coupling between \u039bN\nand\u03a3Nwas taken into account [1118]. An early review on the hyperon-nucleon interaction is provided in Ref. [1119]. An\noverview of the work of the Nijmegen group can be found in Ref. [1120], while the tools for describing the Y Ninteraction\nwithin chiral EFT, pursued by the Juelich-Bonn group, are summarized in Ref. [1121].\nContrary to the meson-baryon systems discussed above, excited hadrons in form of conventional q\u00afqorqqqstates\ncannot occur in BBsystems. However, it is possible to find exotic hadrons, the so-called dibaryons. Historically, one has\ntried to distinguish between genuine (compact) 6qstates, with masses well below the lowest BBthreshold, and bound\nstates/resonances close to the physical region and generated by the (coupled-channel) dynamics. Whether that distinction\nis meaningful on a practical level is a matter of believe. In any case, predictions like the H-dibaryon (a state with S=\u22122,\nJ=0,I=0) [1122] have definitely stimulated the interest in the S=\u22122sector for decades. In recent times there has\nbeen some excitement about a dibaryon in the NNsector, the d\u2217(2380)discovered at the COSY facility in Juelich [1123],\nwhich is associated with a possible \u2206\u2206bound state (with J=3,I=0). For a detailed discussion of this state, and a\nmore general review of dibaryons, see Ref. [1124].\nThe next two subsections provide an introduction to the theoretical frameworks most commonly applied for construct-\ning the interactions in the BBsystem, chiral EFT and meson-exchange. In Sect. 5.3 the \u039bN-\u03a3Nsystem is discussed.\nAn overview of results for the \u039bp,\u03a3\u2212p, and \u03a3+pchannels is given. These are the channels which are experimentally\nreasonably well explored. In addition, the situation regarding a possible bound state (dibaryon) near the \u03a3Nthreshold\nin the3S1-3D1partial wave is examined. Its appearance and structure is closely related with the strength of the \u039bN-\u03a3N\nchannel coupling. Sect. 5.4 is devoted to the S=\u22122sector. One of the aspects summarized is the present situation re-\n68\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\nE [MeV]\u039b\u039b\u039bN\n\u039bcNNN \u039eNNN\u03c0 NN\u03c0\u03c0\n\u03a3N\u039bN\u03c0\n\u039eN \u039eN\u03c0\n\u03a3\u03a3\n\u039eN\u03c0\u039b\u03a3\u03a3\u03a3\u03a3N\u03c0N\u2206\n\u03a3cN \u039bcN\u03c0 \u03a3c*N(I=1)(I=0)\u03a3*N\u039bN\u03c0\u03c0\n\u039b\u03a3\u03c0\n\u039b\u03a3\u03c0\u039e*N\u039b\u03a3*\u039e*N\n\u039b*\u03a3Figure 45: Thresholds of baryon-baryon systems with strangeness S=0,\u22121,\u22122and with charm.

Those allow conclusions on the properties of the \u039b\u039band\u039e\u2212p\ninteraction. Finally, in Sect. 5.5 the situation in other BBsystems is briefly reviewed.\n5.1. Baryon-baryon interaction in chiral effective field theory\nThe application of chiral EFT to the NNsystem is thoroughly documented in various reviews, see e.g. [1125, 1126].\nPotentials up to the fifth order in the chiral expansion have been presented [1127, 1128]. Chiral potentials for the BB\ninteraction involving strange baryons are so far available up to the third order [1129]. Details on the derivation of the\nchiral BBpotentials for the strangeness sector at leading order (LO) using the Weinberg power counting and assuming\napproximate SU(3) flavor symmetry can be found in Refs. [1130] and [1131], and for up to next-to-leading order (NL0)\nin Ref. [1132]. Here we provide only a brief summary of the essential features.\nThe LO potential consists of four-baryon contact terms without derivatives and of one-pseudoscalar-meson exchanges,\nsee Fig. 46 (top). As described in Ref. [1130], imposing SU(3) symmetry there are six independent contact interactions\nat LO whose strength can be given in terms of six corresponding low-energy coefficients (LECs). Not surprisingly,\nthe number of terms corresponds to the number of irreducible representations of SU(3) for the octet baryons: 8\u00d78=\n27+10+10\u2217+8s+8a+1[102]. The LECs contribute to the1S0and3S1partial waves (using the standard partial-wave\nnotation2S+1LJforBBsystems) and need to be determined by a fit to experimental data.\nThelowestorder SU(3)finvariantpseudoscalar-meson\u2013baryoninteractionLagrangianwiththeappropriatesymmetries\nwas discussed in [1130, 1132]. It leads to a one-pseudoscalar-meson-exchange potential similar to the static one-pion-\nexchange potential in [1133] (recoil and relativistic corrections give higher order contributions),\nVB1B2\u2192B\u2032\n1B\u2032\n2=\u2212fB1B\u2032\n1PfB2B\u2032\n2P(\u03c31\u22c5q)(\u03c32\u22c5q)\nq2+m2\nP, (5.1)\nwhere mPis the mass of the exchanged pseudoscalar meson. The transferred and average momentum, qandk, are\ndefined in terms of the final and initial c.m. momenta of the baryons, p\u2032andp, asq=p\u2032\u2212pandk=(p\u2032+p)/2. Assuming\nSU(3)fsymmetry imposes specific relations between the coupling constants fBiB\u2032\njPso that they can be expressed in\nterms of a coupling constant fand the F/(F+D)-ratio \u03b1[102]. Here f\u2261gA/2f0where f0is the pseudoscalar-meson\ndecay constant in the chiral limit, gAis the axial-vector strength measured in neutron \u03b2-decay, and FandDare coupling\nconstants which satisfy the relation F+D=gA\u22431.26. In the Y Npotentials of the Juelich-Bonn group f0is fixed to the\nweak pion decay constant, f\u03c0=92.4 MeV. In the extension to next-to-next-to-leading order (N2LO) the explicit SU(3)\nbreaking of the decay constant was taken into account by using the empirical values for f\u03c0,fK, and f \u03b7[1129]. For the\nF/(F+D)-ratio the SU(6) value ( \u03b1=0.4) was adopted in all BBstudies.\nIn next-to-leading order (NLO), contributions from (non-iterative) two-pseudoscalar-meson exchange diagrams arise\n[1132, 1134]. Those involve the leading meson-baryon Lagrangian which describes a (Weinberg-Tomozawa) vertex between\ntwo baryons and two mesons. Explicit expressions for the resulting NLO potential can be found in the appendix of\n69\n\nLO\nNLO\nNNLO\nFigure 46: Diagrams contributing at LO (top), NLO (center), and N2LO (bottom) in chiral EFT. Solid and dashed lines denote octet baryons\nand pseudoscalar mesons, respectively.\nRef. [1132]. A graphical representation of the contributions is provided in the middle line of Fig. 46 and consists of\n(irreducible) planar box, crossed box, triangle, and football diagrams. In addition there are four-baryon contact terms\nwith two derivatives, involving additional LECs. Performing a partial wave projection for the latter and imposing again\nSU(3)fsymmetry one finds that in case of the Y Ninteraction there are ten new coefficients entering the Swaves and\nS-Dtransitions, respectively, and eight coefficients in the P-waves [1132]. Finally, at N2LO contributions involving the\nsubleading meson-baryon Lagrangian [1129] arise. Those are depicted at the bottom of Fig. 46.\nThe reaction amplitudes are obtained in a DCC approach by solving a coupled-channel Lippmann-Schwinger (LS)\nequation for the interaction potentials:\nT\u03bd\u2032\u2032\u03bd\u2032,J\n\u03c1\u2032\u2032\u03c1\u2032(p\u2032\u2032, p\u2032;E)=V\u03bd\u2032\u2032\u03bd\u2032,J\n\u03c1\u2032\u2032\u03c1\u2032(p\u2032\u2032, p\u2032)+\u2211\n\u03c1,\u03bd\u222b\u221e\n0dpp2\n(2\u03c0)3V\u03bd\u2032\u2032\u03bd,J\n\u03c1\u2032\u2032\u03c1(p\u2032\u2032, p)2\u00b5\u03bd\nq2\u03bd\u2212p2+i\u03b7T\u03bd\u03bd\u2032,J\n\u03c1\u03c1\u2032(p, p\u2032;E). (5.2)\nThe label \u03bdindicates the particle channels and the label \u03c1the partial wave. The pertinent reduced mass is denoted by\n\u00b5\u03bd. The on-shell momentum in the intermediate state, q\u03bd, is defined by E=EB1,\u03bd+EB2,\u03bd=\u221a\nM2\nB1,\u03bd+q2\u03bd+\u221a\nM2\nB2,\u03bd+q2\u03bd.\nRelativistic kinematics is used for relating the laboratory energy Tlabof the hyperons to the c.m. momentum. In\nprinciple, one could also use a relativistic propagator like in Eq. (2.47), which in fact has been done in the first Y N\npotential developed in Juelich [1135]. However, then one can no longer straightforwardly apply the potentials in standard\nfew-bodycalculationsofhypernuclei[1136\u20131138]orinnuclearmatterstudies[1139,1140], whichallrequirenon-relativistic\nkinematics.\nThe LS equation is solved in the particle basis, in order to incorporate the correct physical thresholds. Depending on\nthe specific values of strangeness and charge up to six baryon-baryon channels can couple. For the S=\u22121sector where a\ncomparison with scattering data is possible the Coulomb interaction is taken into account appropriately. The potentials\nin the LS equation are cut off with a regulator function, exp[\u2212(p\u20324+p4)/\u039b4], in order to remove high-energy components\nof the baryon and pseudoscalar meson fields [1134]. Cut-off values in the range 500, ...,650 MeV are considered, similar to\nwhat was used for chiral NNpotentials [1134]. In the extension to N2LO [1129] a novel scheme is used, called semilocal\nmomentum-space (SMS) regularization [1127].\nAlternative chiral EFT approaches to the BBinteraction involving strange baryons have been pursued in Ref. [1141],\nwhere the so-called Kaplan-Savage-Weise (KSW) resummation scheme [1142] has been applied, and in Refs. [1143\u20131145]\nwhere calculations are performed in covariant chiral EFT, but so far only at LO.\n5.2. Baryon-baryon interaction in the meson-exchange picture\nFor a long time investigations of the BBinteractions have been done primarily within phenomenological meson-exchange\npotentials such as the Juelich [1135, 1146, 1147], Nijmegen [1120, 1148, 1149], or Ehime [1150, 1151] potentials. Below\nwe give a brief introduction to these type of models.\nConventional meson-exchange models of the Y Ninteraction are usually also based on the assumption of SU(3) flavor\nsymmetry for the occurring coupling constants, and in some cases even on the SU(6) symmetry of the quark model, see\n70\n\nRefs. [1135, 1146]. In the derivation of the meson-exchange contributions one follows essentially the same procedure as\noutlined in the previous subsection, for the case of pseudoscalar mesons. Besides the lowest pseudoscalar-meson multiplet\nalso the exchanges of vector mesons ( \u03c1,\u03c9,K\u2217), of scalar mesons ( \u03c3(f0(500)), ...), or even of axial-vector mesons\n(a1(1260), ...) [1120, 1149] are included. The spin-space structure of the corresponding meson-baryon Lagrangians differ\nfrom that for pseudo-scalar mesons and, accordingly, the final expressions for the corresponding contributions to the\nY Ninteraction potentials differ as well. Details can be found in Refs. [1120, 1135, 1148]. We want to emphasize that\neven for pseudoscalar mesons the final result for the interaction potentials differs, in general, from the expression given\nin Eq. (5.1). Contrary to the chiral EFT approach, recoil and relativistic corrections are often kept in meson-exchange\nmodels because no power counting rules are applied. Moreover, in case of the Juelich potential pseudoscalar coupling is\nassumed for the meson-baryon interaction Lagrangian for the pseudoscalar mesons instead of the pseudovector coupling\ndictated by chiral symmetry. Note that in some Y Npotentials of the Juelich group [1135, 1146] contributions from\ntwo-meson exchanges are included. The ESC08 and ESC16 potentials [1120, 1149] include likewise contributions from\ntwo-meson exchange, in particular, so-called meson-pair diagrams analog to the last three diagrams shown in the center\nof Fig. 46. Moreover, there are some Y Npotentials which include the coupling to channels with decuplet baryons ( \u03a3\u2217N,\n\u039b\u2206,\u03a3\u2206) [1135, 1146, 1152].\nThe major conceptual difference between the various meson-exchange models consists in the treatment of the scalar-\nmeson sector. This simply reflects the fact that, unlike for pseudoscalar and vector mesons, so far there is no general\nagreement about what are the actual members of the lowest lying scalar-meson SU(3) multiplet. See for example a\nreview [1153] about the long debated f0(500)resonance. Therefore, besides the question of the masses of the exchange\nparticles it also remains unclear whether and how the relations for the coupling constants should be specified. As a\nconsequence, different prescriptions for describing the scalar sector, whose contributions play a crucial role in any BB\ninteraction at intermediate ranges, were adopted by the various authors who published meson-exchange models of the\nY Ninteraction. For example, the Nijmegen group views this interaction as being generated by genuine scalar-meson\nexchange. In their models NSC97 [1148] and ESC08 (ESC16) [1120, 1149] a scalar SU(3) nonet is exchanged - namely,\ntwo isospin- 0mesons (an \u03f5(760) and the f0(980)) an isospin- 1meson ( a0(980)) and an isospin-1/2 strange meson \u03bawith\na mass of 1000 MeV . In the initial Y Nmodels of the Juelich group [1135, 1146] a \u03c3meson with a mass of \u2248550 MeV\nis included which is viewed as arising from correlated \u03c0\u03c0exchange. In practice, however, the coupling strength of this\nfictitious \u03c3to the baryons is treated as a free parameter and fitted to the data. In the latest meson-exchange Y Npotential\npresented by the Juelich group [1147] a microscopic model of correlated \u03c0\u03c0andK\u00afKexchange [1154] is utilized to fix the\ncontributions in the scalar-isoscalar ( \u03c3) and vector-isovector ( \u03c1) channels.\nLet us mention for completeness that meson-exchange models are typically equipped with phenomenological form\nfactors in order to cut off the potential for large momenta (short distances). For example, in case of the Y Nmodels of the\nJuelich group the interaction is supplemented with form factors for each meson-baryon-baryon vertex, c.f., [1135, 1146]\nfor details. Those form factors are meant to take into account the extended hadron structure and are parametrized in\nthe conventional monopole or dipole form. In the case of the Nijmegen potentials, a Gaussian form factor is used. In\naddition, there is some intricate short-range phenomenology that controls the interaction at short distances [1120, 1149].\nFinally, we note that realistic models for the Y Ninteraction have been also established within the constituent quark\nmodel [1155].\n5.3. The \u039bN-\u03a3Nsystem\nLet us first focus on two channels of the \u039bN-\u03a3Ncoupled-channel system, namely on \u039bp, on the one hand, which couples\nto the \u03a3+nand\u03a30pchannels, and \u03a3\u2212p, which couples to \u039bnand\u03a30n. This choice is dictated by the fact that for\nthose systems scattering data for low momenta are available. Indeed, in case of \u03a3\u2212pbesides the cross section for elastic\nscattering also the transition cross sections to the other two channels have been established. It should be noted that\nthere are data for \u039bp\u2192\u03a30ptoo [1157], which are, however, incompatible with the measurements for \u03a3\u2212p\u2192\u039bnwhen\nconsidering isospin symmetry and the principle of detailed balance. Moreover, there are data on the \u03a30ptwo-particle\nmomentum correlation function [1158] which, however, suffer from low statistics. There are also data on \u03a3+p, which,\nhowever, is an isospin I=3/2state and does not couple to \u039bN. Thus, we do not discuss the pertinent results here and\nrefer the interested reader to the original works [1129, 1132, 1148, 1156]. Nonetheless, it should be emphasized that the\ninteraction in the I=3/2channel is not disconnected from the results for the other ones. Because of the underlying\nisospin symmetry the potentials for \u03a3\u2212p,\u03a30p, etc. are combinations of the I=1/2andI=3/2components.\nCross sections are presented in Fig. 47 for a selection of Y Npotentials. In case of the chiral potentials from 2019 [1156]\nbands are shown which reflect the residual cutoff dependence, i.e., the variation of the results for \u039b=500, ...,650 MeV\n[1156]. For completeness, we list also results for the effective range parameters in Table 5. As one can see from the figure\nthe data at low energy are rather well reproduced, though one should certainly keep in mind that those data are the ones\nincluded in the fitting procedure to determine the free parameters of the interaction. The channel coupling, i.e., its effect\non\u039bp, is easily recognizable by the large cusp-like structure at the \u03a3Nthreshold which is predicted by all considered\npotentials and, actually, in all coupled-channel treatments which provide a realistic description of the \u039bpand\u03a3\u2212pdata\n71\n\n100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000\nplab (MeV/c)0100200\u03c3 (mb) Sechi-Zorn et al.\nAlexander et al.\nHauptman et al.\nPiekenbrock\nRowley et al.\u039bp -> \u039bp\n100 120 140 160 180\nplab (MeV/c)050100150200250300\u03c3 (mb) Engelmann et al.\u03a3\u2212p -> \u039bn \n100 120 140 160 180\nplab (MeV/c)0100200300400500\u03c3 (mb) Engelmann et al.\u03a3\u2212p -> \u03a30n\n100 120 140 160 180\nplab (MeV/c)050100150200250300\u03c3 (mb) Eisele et al.\u03a3\u2212p -> \u03a3\u2212p\n100 120 140 160 180\nplab (MeV/c)050100150200250\u03c3 (mb) Eisele et al.

In addition cross, sections of meson-exchange potentials by the Juelich group (Juelich \u201904 [1147], dashed blue line) and the\nNijmegen group (NSC97f [1148], dash-dotted black line) are included.\nincluding the \u03a3\u2212pcapture ratio at rest. Unfortunately, the few \u039bpdata points available in the pertinent momentum\nregion suffer from low statics and poor momentum resolution and do not allow any conclusions.\nNonetheless, there is solid information on the existence of a threshold effect from measurements of the \u039bpinvariant-\nmass spectrum in reactions like K\u2212d\u2192\u03c0\u2212\u039bp,\u03c0+d\u2192K+\u039bp, orpp\u2192K+\u039bp, but also from studies of the \u039bptwo-particle\nmomentum correlation function in high energy ppcollisions. Indeed, the first evidence for a cusp-like structure was\nTable 5: Scattering lengths ( a) and effective ranges ( r) for singlet (s) and triplet (t) S-waves (in fm), for \u039bN,\u03a3Nwith isospin I=1/2,3/2.\nThe results are for the chiral Y Npotentials NLO13 [1132], NLO19 [1156], and SMS NLO (500) and N2LO (550) [1129].

The\ndashed-doubled-dotted lines are the full results, including the1S0andP- and D-waves.\nalready reported as early as 1961 [1162], but the first convincing signal and still one of the most prominent examples is\nfrom the measurement of the reaction K\u2212d\u2192\u03c0\u2212\u039bpby Tan in 1969 [1159]. A review of other early observations can be\nfound in Ref. [1163] and an overview of later measurements is provided by Machner et al. [1164]. More recent examples\nfor the presence of a \u03a3Nthreshold effect, in the reaction pp\u2192K+\u039bp, can be found in Refs. [561, 1160, 1165]. Very\nrecently evidence of the threshold structure has been also observed in measurements of the \u039bpcorrelation function in pp\ncollisions at\u221as=13GeV by the ALICE Collaboration [1161]. For illustration we present a selection of measurements\nin Fig. 48. Note that there are plans at J-PARC for performing a dedicated experiment to pin down the threshold cusp\nmore quantitatively [1005].\nAs already mentioned in the introduction to this section, the interesting question is, of course, whether the observed\nthreshold effect is a signal for a dibaryon - in form of a deuteron-like \u03a3Nbound state - or whether it is simply a regular\ncusp that is enhanced due to the presence of a near-by virtual state. In the latter case there would be a sharp peak\ndirectly at the \u03a3Nthreshold while in the former ideally one expects to see a peak below (and well separated from) the\nthreshold. However, there are two issues that complicate any calculation/interpretation. First, while there are only two\nchannels in isospin space there are three in the physical world and, thus, there are two \u03a3Nthresholds, namely those\nof\u03a3+nand\u03a30p. Second, and more important, because of the tensor coupling in the3S1-3D1partial wave there are\nthree amplitudes that are responsible for generating the threshold effect, namely the S- and Dwave and also the S\u2194D\ntransition. The two aspects are illustrated in Fig. 49. On the left hand side is a close-up of the \u039bpcross section around\n73\n\nthe\u03a3Nthresholds predicted by the considered potentials. One can see that in all cases the peak of the produced cusp-like\nstructure coincides with the lower ( \u03a3+n) threshold. At the \u03a30pthreshold there is only a kink. On the right hand side\none can see the different partial-wave contributions to the \u039bpcross section around the \u03a3Nthresholds.\nAnyway, given the experimental situation, in the past the possibility of a dibaryon was discussed predominantly in\nthe context of the reaction K\u2212d\u2192\u03c0\u2212\u039bpowing to the prominent experimental signal [1163, 1166\u20131172]. While initial\ninvestigations were more or less inconclusive, in the latest works [1169, 1171, 1172] the unanimous conclusion has been\ndrawn that a \u03a3Nbound state does not exist near the \u03a3Nthreshold. However, one must keep in mind that in those\nstudies simplified models of the Y Ninteraction were employed. Specifically, with regard to the3S1-3D1partial wave\nwhere a possible dibaryon occurs, the tensor coupling mediated by the long-ranged one-pion exchange was ignored and\nusually only the S-wave component was taken into account. Realistic Y Npotentials suggest that the \u039bN\u2192\u03a3Ntransition\noccurs predominantly from the \u039bN3D1state [1130, 1132, 1135, 1146\u20131148, 1156, 1173, 1174]. Furthermore, in those early\nworks often no constraints from SU(3) flavor symmetry were implemented. Though SU(3) symmetry is certainly broken,\npresumably on the level of 20 - 30% [1175], it is likely to end up with unrealistic results if one ignores it altogether.\nIn Ref. [1164] a systematic but purely phenomenological attempt was made to determine the position of the peak. In\nthat work a combined analysis of the structure as seen in the older data from K\u2212d\u2192\u03c0\u2212\u039bpwith the new measurements of\npp\u2192K+\u039bpwas performed. For that as tools a Breit-Wigner parameterization as well as a Flatt\u00e9 approach was employed\nto determine the position of the peak. Values that agree quite well for the various measurements were found and the\nreported mean value amounts to 2128.7\u00b10.3 MeV, which pretty much coincides with the threshold energy of the \u03a3+n\nchannel. The authors concluded that the structure should be interpreted as a genuine cusp, signaling an inelastic virtual\nstate in the3S1-3D1partial wave of the \u03a3N I=1/2channel.\nAn entirely different strategy was followed in the works of [181] and [169]. Those studies focused on the \u039bN-\u03a3N\nsystem itself and explored directly the pole structure of the coupled-channel amplitude in the3S1-3D1partial wave in the\nregion of the \u03a3Nthreshold, see also the more educational analysis that has been presented in Ref. [1176]. Though there\nis no useful empirical information on the \u039bpcross section around the \u03a3Nthreshold, as mentioned above, in principle\nthe threshold region is well constrained by cross section data on the \u03a3\u2212pelastic and inelastic channels. In addition the\nso-called capture ratio at rest has been determined with high precision [1177, 1178]. The latter is defined by [1118]\nrR=1\n4\u03c3s(\u03a3\u2212p\u2192\u03a30n)\n\u03c3s(\u03a3\u2212p\u2192\u039bn)+\u03c3s(\u03a3\u2212p\u2192\u03a30n)+3\n4\u03c3t(\u03a3\u2212p\u2192\u03a30n)\n\u03c3t(\u03a3\u2212p\u2192\u039bn)+\u03c3t(\u03a3\u2212p\u2192\u03a30n),\nwhere \u03c3s(\u03c3t) is the total reaction cross section in the singlet1S0(triplet3S1-3D1) partial wave. The cross sections are\nthe ones at zero momentum, but in calculations it is common practice [1148] to evaluate the cross sections at a small\nnon-zero momentum, namely plab=10 MeV /c. The essential question is, of course, in how far those data pin down the\ncoupled-channel amplitude and, in turn, allow one to determine the location of the poles reliably.\nIn Ref. [181] a variety of meson-exchange potentials of the Nijmegen group has been explored, NSC97f [1148] being\nthe most modern one at that time. The poles were searched in the complex planes of the relative momenta in the \u039bN\nand\u03a3Nchannels, q\u039bNandq\u03a3N, respectively. It turned out that for two of the considered potentials the poles are on\nthe second quadrant of the q\u03a3Nplane while for the other two they are on the third quadrant. (For details on various\nconventions used for the classification of the pole structure we refer to [9, 1176].) In the first case this should indicate\nan unstable (dibaryon-like) bound state while the second implies an inelastic virtual state. The resulting shape of the\n\u039bNcross section around the \u03a3Nthreshold is also illustrated in [181] and should consist of a round peak, similar to a\nBreit-Wigner form, below the threshold in the first case, and a sharp peak (cusp) at the threshold in the second case,\naccording to text-book knowledge [1179]. However, as is obvious from the concrete results reported in Ref. [181] for the\nconsidered potentials, not all show the idealized shape. In particular, for NSC97f that produces an unstable bound state,\nin the nomenclature of Ref. [9], the resulting shape is ambiguous [181], see also Fig. 49.\nIn Ref. [169] the poles and the resulting structure were investigated more systematically by considering a larger set\nof potentials, including the new chiral Y Npotentials, and by performing the calculations not only in isospin basis but\nalso for the charge Q=1(\u039bp\u2212\u03a3+n\u2212\u03a30p) as well as for the Q=0(\u039bn\u2212\u03a30n\u2212\u03a3\u2212p) coupled-channel systems. The found\npole positions are summarized in Fig. 50. One can see that most of the poles are located in the 2nd quadrant (sheet II).\nThe few exceptions where the poles are either in the 3rd quadrant (sheet IV) or very close to it concern potentials that\ndo not describe the near-threshold \u03a3\u2212pdata well, as emphasized in Ref. [169]. For example, the Juelich \u201904 potential\n(blue inverted triangle in the left plot) fails to reproduce the capture ratio and it also underestimates the \u03a3\u2212p\u2192\u039bncross\nsection, see Fig. 47.\nAs one can see in Fig. 50 the poles are in the lower half of the 2nd quadrant, i.e., Imq\u03a3N\u2264\u2223Req\u03a3N\u2223. A Breit-Wigner\ntype signal can be only expected, however, when the poles are sufficiently close to the \u03a3Nthreshold and specifically close\nto the negative or positive Im q\u03a3Naxis. Obviously, the second condition is not fulfilled by any of the Y Npotentials.\nThus, one is far from the mentioned ideal case and that means, citing Pearce and Gibson [1176], in \u201ca gray area where it\nis not obvious whether the effect will be cusp or peak\u201d.\nAnyway, the conclusion drawn from the analysis in Ref. [169] is that, if one takes the presently available low-energy\n\u03a3Ndata serious and aims at their best possible reproduction, then the appearance of a deuteron-like dibaryon in form of a\n74\n\n-80 -60 -40 -20 0 20\nRe q (MeV/c)-80-60-40-20020406080Im q (MeV/c)\u03a3N\n-80 -60 -40 -20 0 20\nRe q (MeV/c)-80-60-40-20020406080Im q (MeV/c)q (\u03a30p)\nq (\u03a3+n)\u03a3+n-\u03a30p\n-80 -60 -40 -20 0 20\nRe q (MeV/c)-80-60-40-20020406080Im q (MeV/c)q (\u03a3\u2212p)\nq (\u03a30n)\u03a30n-\u03a3\u2212pFigure 50: Pole positions for the Nijmegen NSC97f model (triangles), and the chiral Y Npotentials NLO13 (squares) and NLO19 (circles),\nand the SMS potentials from Ref.

In the latter cases the poles for the two \u03a3Nchannels are shown in the same plot. In case of\nisospin averaged masses also results for the Juelich meson-exchange potentials \u201904 [1147] (blue inverted triangle), \u00c3 [1146] (blue diamond), and\nA [1135] (blue star), and for the Nijmegen potential ND [1173] (plus) are included.\n(unstable) \u03a3Nbound state close to the \u03a3Nthreshold seems to be practically unavoidable. On the other and, there is also\nstrong evidence that it might be wishful thinking to expect a truly convincing and unambiguous signal for a strangeness\nS=\u22121dibaryon, i.e., a peak that is well separated from the (and unambiguously below the) \u03a3Nthreshold.\n5.4. Coupled channels with strangeness S=\u22122\nAs one can see from Fig. 45 the strangeness S=\u22122sector is extremely rich as far as coupled channels are concerned.\nMoreover, the separation of the thresholds is, in general, fairly small, with the ones between \u039b\u039band\u039eNbeing just about\n25 MeV. However, contrary to the strangeness S=\u22121sector discussed above experimental information on BBchannels\nwith S=\u22122is really very much limited. Indeed for many of the reactions only upper limits on the cross sections have\nbeen established. A summary of available data is provided in Ref. [1180]. Recently, a new source of information has\nopened up by measurements of two-particle momentum correlation functions by the ALICE and STAR collaborations.\nSo far data on the \u039b\u039b[1181, 1182] and \u039e\u2212p[1183\u20131185] channels have been published.\n5.4.1. The H-dibaryon\nCertainly the most interesting aspect related to the S=\u22122sector and one of the main motivations for pertinent inves-\ntigations has been the possible existence of the H-dibaryon. Initially proposed as a deeply bound 6-quark state with\nJ=0andI=0by Jaffe, based on the bag model [1122], it has been suggested as a dark-matter candidate in recent\ntimes [1186, 1187]. Given its quantum numbers it should couple to the \u039b\u039b\u2212\u039eN\u2212\u03a3\u03a3system. With its proposed energy\nof2150 MeV it would lie around 80 MeVbelow the \u039b\u039bthreshold.\nNone of the past experimental searches for the H-dibaryon has let to convincing signals, see e.g. [1188]. However,\nin 2010 the interest in that state was revitalized by evidence for a bound H-dibaryon based on lattice QCD calculations\n[1189\u20131191]. The calculations were performed for quark masses that correspond to unphysical meson and baryon masses,\nspecifically to pion masses of 230and389 MeV in case of the NPLQCD Collaboration and 469-1171 MeV by the HAL\nQCD Collaboration. The most recent lattice calculations of the Hare from the Mainz group [1192] for m\u03c0\u2248420 MeV\nand the HAL QCD calculation near the physical point [1193]. The latter work concludes that the \u039b\u039battraction is too\nweak to generate a bound or resonant dihyperon, see the discussion below. In the former work and in [1194] one can also\nfind a review of earlier lattice calculations. A compilation of available predictions for the H-dibaryon is given in Fig. 51.\nAs shown in this figure (from Ref. [1192]), systematics due to continuum extrapolations also may play an important role\nin identifying this illusive state from QCD.\nImmediately after the publication of the lattice results several attempts have been made to extrapolate those results to\nthephysicalpionmass. Thoseextrapolations,performedwithdifferentmethodsandunderdifferentassumptionssuggested\nthat the H-dibaryon could be either loosely bound or move into the continuum [1194, 1195]. In Ref. [1196, 1197] chiral\nEFT at leading order was employed to study the fate of the H-dibaryon for physical masses.

The\nvariation of lattice spacing from the calculations of Ref. [1192] is shown by the orange band. The figure is taken from Ref. [1192].\nthe effect of the pion mass dependence of the interaction (which at LO consists of pion exchange and a contact term)\nwas explored, but also the influence of the baryon masses which depend likewise on the quark mass and which enter the\nscattering or bound-state equations (5.2). It was found that the mass dependence of the latter has a much more dramatic\neffect on the binding energy of the Hthan the pion-mass dependence of the potential. The effect is caused by the relative\nshift of the three thresholds \u039b\u039b,\u03a3\u03a3and\u039eNdue to the SU(3) breaking in the masses. Specifically, with physical values\nthe binding energy of the His reduced by as much as 60 MeVas compared to a calculation based on degenerate (i.e.\nSU(3) symmetric) BBthresholds. Translating this observation to the situation in the HAL QCD calculation, implied\nthat the bound state should disappear at the physical point. For the case of the NPLQCD calculation, a resonance in\nthe\u039b\u039bsystem might survive.\nOf course, nowadays lattice calculations at (almost) the physical point ( m\u03c0\u2243146 MeV ,mK\u2243525 MeV ) are available,\nthanks to the work of the HAL QCD Collaboration [1193]. Their results for the \u039b\u039bphase-shift in the the1S0partial\nwave are shown in Fig. 52 for the t/a=12case with tthe sink-source time separation and athe lattice spacing. In that\ncalculation no bound state (nor a resonances) was found around the \u039b\u039bthreshold. However, as one can see in the figure,\nthere is still a remnant of the H-dibaryon, in form of a virtual state in the \u039eNchannel close to its threshold. It produces\na sizable cusp-like structure in the \u039b\u039bphase. Interestingly, the chiral potential at NLO, established a few years earlier\nby the Juelich group [1180], produces such a cusp too. (More details of that interaction will be discussed below.) On the\nother hand, the results of both groups indicate that the actual location of the virtual state is still uncertain. For example,\nin the calculation with the chiral potential the large cusp appears only when solving the coupled-channel equations with\nisospin averaged \u039eNmasses (left side). Once the mass difference between the \u039e0and\u039e\u2212is taken into account, i.e., the\nsplitting between the thresholds for \u039e0nand\u039e\u2212p, the virtual state is no longer close to either of the thresholds and the\ncusp structure is strongly reduced (right side).\n5.4.2. \u039eNscattering\nFor illustrating the experimental situation in the S=\u22122sector, as examples \u039e\u2212pelastic and inelastic cross sections\nare presented in Fig. 53. The theory results for the \u039eNcross sections are based on a \u039eNpotential established within\nchiral EFT in 2019 [1198]. Again the bands reflect the residual cutoff dependence. In the construction of the potential\nconstraints from the \u039b\u039bscattering length in the1S0state together with experimental upper bounds on the cross sections\nfor\u039eNscattering and for the transition \u039eN\u2192\u039b\u039bhave been exploited. This allowed to fix the additional LECs that arise\nin the{1}irreducible representation of SU(3) [1180], which contribute only to the BBinteraction in the S=\u22122sector.\nFurthermore, the consideration of those empirical constraints necessitated to add SU(3) symmetry breaking contact terms\nin other irreps ( {27},{10},{10\u2217},{8s},{8a}), with regard to those determined from the \u039bNand\u03a3Ndata. This is\nanyway expected and fully in line with the power counting of SU(3) chiral EFT, as discussed in Ref. [1199]. It is interesting\nto see that the theory predicts coupled-channel effects at the opening of the \u039b\u03a3channel. But these are just standard\n(moderate) cusp structures and it will be difficult to verify their existence experimentally. Note that the recent BESIII\ndata [1200] shown in Fig. 54 (middle) are for \u039e0n\u2192\u039e\u2212p, and actually deduced from the \u039e0+9Be reaction.\nAt present, the only more quantitative test for the \u039eNinteraction is provided by two-particle momentum correlations.\nFor\u039e\u2212p, correlation functions have been measured recently by the ALICE Collaboration in p-Pb collisions at 5.02TeV\n[1183] and in ppcollisions at 13TeV [1184]. There are also new and still preliminary results from Au+Au collisions at\n76\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\nEcm (MeV)-20-10010203040506070\u03b4  (degrees)\u039b\u039b1S0\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\nEcm (MeV)-20-10010203040506070\u03b4  (degrees)\u039b\u039b1S0Figure 52: Phase shift for the \u039b\u039b1S0partial wave. The results are from the lattice simulation by the HAL QCD Collaboration [1193] (blue\nband) and the chiral NLO potential [1180] (red band). The former calculation corresponds to (meson and baryon) masses which are slightly\nlarger than the physical ones and, therefore, the \u039eNthreshold appears at a higher energy. The curves on the left are for isospin averaged\nmasses, while on the right-hand side physical masses have been used.\n0 200 400 600 800\nplab (MeV/c)0102030405060708090100\u03c3 (mb) Ahn (2006) \u039e\u2212p ->  \u039e\u2212p\n--->--->\n0 200 400 600 800\nplab (MeV/c)0102030405060708090100\u03c3 (mb) Ahn (2006)\nBESIII (2023)\u039e\u2212p ->  \u039e0n\n0 200 400 600 800\nplab (MeV/c)0102030405060708090100\u03c3 (mb) Aoki (1998) \u039e\u2212p ->  \u039b\u039b,\u039e0n,\u03a30\u039b\nFigure 53: Results for the \u039eNcross sections of the NLO potential [1198].

Details on the evaluation of such correlation functions can be found, e.g., in Refs. [1203, 1204]. Clearly, the\ncorrelation functions, evaluated for the source radii Rtaken from the corresponding ppfits by ALICE [1182] ( 1.43fm for\n5.02TeV and 1.18fm for 13TeV), agree nicely with the measurements. For a more thorough discussion on the choice of\nRand of the other parameters that enter into the calculation, see the work of Kamiya et al. [1204]. In this context, note\nalso the critics on the \u201cuniversality assumption\u201d for the source (radius) in Ref. [1014]. Comparable results have been also\nachieved by Liu et al. [1205] based on a full coupled-channel potential ( \u039b\u039b,\u039eN,\u039b\u03a3,\u03a3\u03a3) established within covariant\nchiral EFT, whose LECs were fitted to the \u039b\u039band\u039eNphase shifts of the HAL QCD potential [1193].\nFor completeness, results for the correlation function in the \u039b\u039bchannel are shown too. Exploratory calculations [1203,\n1204] suggested that there could be a pronounced threshold effect at the opening of the \u039eNchannel, cf. Fig. 52. However,\nthe data from ALICE themselves do not exhibit any structure, though admittedly the statistics is low and the momentum\nresolution too poor.\n5.5. Other coupled baryon-baryon systems\nThe interaction of octet baryons in BBchannels with strangeness S=\u22123,\u22124have been studied in the meson-exchange\npicture [1206] and in chiral EFT [1207, 1208] by exploiting the underlying SU(3) symmetry. However, there are large\nvariations/ambiguities in the predictions. First but still limited experimental constraints have emerged only recently for\nthe\u039b\u039e\u2212system, again in form of momentum correlation functions [1209]. The present statistics is not sufficient to see\nany coupled-channel effects, say in form of a structure at the opening of the \u03a3\u039echannels. There are also results from\nlattice QCD simulations by the HAL QCD collaboration for quark masses close to the physical point [1210]. Finally,\nthere are some results on the N\u2126interaction from lattice QCD [1211] and empirical correlation functions [1184, 1212].\nThis channel couples to \u039e\u039band\u039e\u03a3.\nRegarding BBsystems with charmed baryons, there are studies on the \u039b+\ncN-\u03a3cNsystem. Again there are results\nfrom lattice QCD simulations by the HAL QCD collaboration [1213, 1214], though in this case the masses are still away\n77\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250\nk (MeV/c)0.60.70.80.91.01.1C(k)\u039b\u039b\n0 50 100 150 200 250\nk (MeV/c)0.60.70.80.91.01.1C(k)\u039b\u039b\n0 50 100 150 200 250\nk (MeV/c)1.01.21.41.61.82.02.22.42.6C(k)NLO\nKamiya et al.\nALICE \u201919\u039e\u2212p 5.02 TeV\n0 50 100 150 200 250\nk (MeV/c)1.01.52.02.53.03.5C(k)NLO\nKamiya et al.\nALICE \u201920\u039e\u2212p 13 TeVFigure 54: \u039b\u039band\u039e\u2212ptwo-particle momentum correlation function calculated from the NLO potential [1198] (red bands).

An extrapolation to the physical point based on (conventional as well as covariant) chiral EFT\nhas been attempted [1215\u20131217] - with in part contradictory results. There are also attempts to construct potential\nmodels based on meson exchange relying on the assumption of SU(4) flavor symmetry [1218, 1219]. In any case, as one\ncan see from Fig. 45, the thresholds in the charm sector are farther apart and actually the \u039b+\ncN\u03c0threshold lies below\nthat of \u03a3cN. Thus, more pronounced coupled-channel effects are unlikely to occur, specifically if the overall strength of\nthe interaction is in the order of magnitude as suggested by the HAL QCD lattice simulations.\n6. Heavy sector\n6.1. The DNinteraction and the charm counterpart of the \u039b(1405)\nIn 1993 first evidence for the \u039bc(2595)+resonance was reported by the CLEO collaboration [1220] and its mass was\nsubsequently confirmed by other experiments [1221\u20131223]. It is now generally believed that this resonance is the charm\ncounterpart of the \u039b(1405) [103]. As discussed in Sect. 3.6, there is strong theoretical evidence that the \u039b(1405) is a \u00afKN\nbound state (molecule) and very likely even has a two-pole structure [200, 502, 585]. This circumstance triggered several\nstudies under the premise that the \u039bc(2595)+could be likewise a dynamically generated state. Those studies build again\non flavor symmetry and on chiral symmetry, and several of them also on heavy-quark spin symmetry (HQSS). In addition,\nin most of the works, the experimentally known mass of the \u039bc(2595)+resonance has been utilized as constraint for fixing\ninherent parameters of the interaction.\nThe connection between the \u00afKNandDNinteractions can be easily established within chiral unitary (and related)\napproaches, by extending the scheme from SU(3) to SU(4) in flavor space. Thereby, in analogy to the \u039b(1405)resonance,\nstates in the corresponding charm sector are generated by the dynamics in the coupled-channel system that involves\nchannels like \u03c0\u039b+\nc,\u03c0\u03a3c, orDN, i.e., where the strange quark in the hadrons is simply replaced by the one with charm\n[276, 1225\u20131232]. There is some dispute on the question how one should deal with the flavor and chiral symmetries in\ndetail and what additional symmetries should be imposed. In the simplest extension based on the SU(3) subgroup one has\nagain an octet of pseudoscalar mesons and an octet (nonet) of ( JP=1/2+) baryons. The number of channels that couple\nis then comparable to those in the strangeness S=\u22121sector.

For the sake of comparison, we list the chiral perturbation theory\nresults of Ref. [64]. One should note, however, that Ref. [64] calculated the scattering lengths up\ntoO(p3).

On the other hand, when implementing\nalso HQSS [1227, 1232], vector mesons and also JP=3/2+baryons enter so that the number of coupled channels increases\nsignificantly. Then one has also D\u2217N,D\u2217\u2206,\u03c9\u039bc, etc. \u2013 in fact a total of 16channels for I=0and22forI=1that\nall couple to DN[1227]. Channels involving vector mesons appear also in the extended local hidden gauge approach\nfollowed in Ref. [1225]. A visual impression of the situation is provided in Fig. 55. Clearly, with the increasing number\nof channels there is a simultaneous increase in the number of dynamically generated states, as spelled out in Ref. [1224]:\n\u201cit seems that the number of states generated is proportional to the number of coupled channels considered\u201d . It should be\nnoted that most of the states found in the calculations have so far not been confirmed experimentally.\nIn the aforementioned approaches the dynamics is provided by vector-meson exchange [1226, 1231], by the Weinberg-\nTomozawa (WT) term [1228\u20131230], or by an extension of the WT interaction to an SU(8) spin-flavor scheme [1227, 1232].\nThe model presented in Ref. [276] is derived within the conventional meson-exchange picture. There, besides contributions\nfrom vector-meson exchanges also scalar-mesons are considered. The included channels are \u03c0\u039b+\nc,\u03c0\u03a3c,DNbut also D\u2217N,\nD\u2206, and D\u2217\u2206, in close analogy to the Juelich \u00afKNpotential model [16] which forms the basis for the extension to the\ncharm sector via SU(4) symmetry.\nThere are also additional works which focus on specific aspects. For example, Refs. [1233, 1234] consider mainly the\nphysics around the \u03a3c(2800)resonance, which is located close to the DNthreshold. A recent overview of the various\ninvestigations can be found in Ref. [1235].\nLet us review in more detail the situation for the \u039bc(2595)+and the \u03a3c(2800). First, we want to emphasize that\nthere is an essential difference between the situation for the \u039b(1405) and for the \u039bc(2595)+: The former is located about\n30MeV below the \u00afKNthreshold while the latter is about 200MeV below the DNthreshold. Thus, if the \u039bc(2595)+is\nindeed a DNbound state it would be rather deeply bound. Accordingly, the interactions have to be fairly strong. Since\nthe mass of the \u039bc(2595)+is commonly used as input, as mentioned above, it is in usually well reproduced in such studies.\nThere is a bit more variation when it comes to the width \u0393, where the present experimental value is 2.6\u00b10.6MeV [103].\nThe theoretical predictions range from 0.6MeV [1227] to 4.8MeV [276]. However, given the delicate situation that the\n\u039bc(2595)+coincides with the \u03c0\u03a3cthresholds and in view of the fact that the three-body decay channel \u03c0\u03c0\u039b+\ncis not\nincluded in any of the calculations the agreement is still remarkably good. Anyway, one has to keep in mind that in\ncalculations typically the pole position is determined whereas the experimental value is the result of a Breit-Wigner type\nfit.\nOne of the characteristic features of the \u039b(1405)in chiral unitary approaches is its two-pole structure, see, e.g.,\nthe review by Mai [200]. Indeed such a two-pole structure is also found for the \u039b(2595)+in several studies, notably\nin Refs. [276, 1225, 1227, 1229, 1232]. In the majority of the calculations, the second pole is very close to that of the\n\u039b(2595)+, say within 10to15MeV but with a considerably larger width. The latter reflects the fact that the second pole\nis already well above the \u03c0\u03a3cthreshold and it is dominated by the \u03c0\u03a3ccomponent. Compared to the \u00afKN(\u039b(1405))\ncase, there is even less concrete experimental evidence for the partner state.

For comparison experimental information\non the \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u039b+\ncmass distribution in the \u039bc(2593)+region is shown. The data are from ARGUS [1222] (open squares), Zheng (CLEO) [1236]\n(circles) and CDF [1223] (filled squares). The nominal thresholds of the \u03c00\u03a3+\nc,\u03c0+\u03a30\nc, and \u03c0\u2212\u03a3++\ncchannels are indicated by vertical lines.\nassociated the second pole with the \u039bc(2625)+but the predicted width is much too large as compared to the experiment.\nAnyway, the latter is now commonly assumed to be a JP=3/2\u2212state, i.e., the counterpart of the \u039b(1520).\nPredictions for the \u03c0\u03a3cinvariant-mass spectrum in the region of the \u039bc(2595)+resonance were presented in Ref. [276],\nobtained from the \u03c0\u03a3c\u2192\u03c0\u03a3candDN\u2192\u03c0\u03a3creaction amplitudes multiplied with the appropriate phase-space factors.\nSince there is no qualitative difference between the two cases, we reproduce here only the results for the latter, see Fig. 56.\nThe invariant-mass distributions are given in arbitrary units but the relative normalization between the different charge\nchannels as predicted by the model has been kept fixed. Then the drastic effect due the splitting of the thresholds in\nthe\u03c0\u03a3cchannels caused by the mass differences between \u03c0\u00b1and\u03c00and between the \u03a3c\u2019s is preserved. Indeed, the\nthreshold of the \u03c00\u03a3+\ncchannel is about 6MeV lower than those of the other two charge channels and, as a consequence,\nthe predicted invariant-mass distribution is about twice as large. Moreover, there is a clear cusp in the \u03c00\u03a3+\ncamplitude at\nthe opening of the \u03c0+\u03a30\ncchannel. The threshold of \u03c0\u2212\u03a3++\ncis just about 0.3MeV above the one for \u03c0+\u03a30\nc. This produces\na noticeable kink in the \u03c00\u03a3+\ncinvariant-mass distribution.\nFor illustration, the experimental \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u039b+\ncmass distributions where the signal for the \u039bc(2595)+is seen [1222, 1236] are\nalso displayed in the left panel of the Fig. 56. The results for the D0p\u2192\u03c00\u03a3+\ncchannel resemble very much the measured\nsignal and one can imagine that smearing out the results by the width of the \u03a3+\nc, which is around 2.3MeV [103], could\nfurther improve the already good agreement with the data. However, experimentally it was found that the \u039bc(2595)+\ndecays predominantly into the \u03c0+\u03a30\ncand\u03c0\u2212\u03a3++\ncchannels with a combined branching fraction in the range of 50% [103].\nSmearing out the corresponding results with the widths of the \u03a30\ncand\u03a3++\nc, which are likewise around 2MeV [103], would\nstill leave a large fraction of the events found below the nominal \u03c0+\u03a30\ncand\u03c0\u2212\u03a3++\ncthreshold unexplained, especially for\nthe data from Ref. [1236]. Thus, it seems that the position of the \u039bc(2595)+resonance being so close to or even below\nthe nominal \u03c0+\u03a30\nc/\u03c0\u2212\u03a3++\ncthresholds and the found large branching ratios into those channels are difficult to reconcile.\nIn any case, one has to keep in mind that there is also a branching fraction of 20% directly into the three-body channel\n\u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u039b+\nc[103], which is not included in the theoretical curve. For a dedicated study of the situation of the \u039bc(2595)+\nbeing so close to the \u03c0\u03a3cthreshold see [1237].\nA comparison with the data from the CDF experiment [1223] is provided in the right panel of Fig. 56. In this case\na background contribution has been established/added in the analysis of the data (cf. dotted line) and we add this\ncontribution to the \u03c0\u03a3cinvariant-mass spectrum evaluated in Ref. [1223]. Once that is done, there is again a fairly good\nagreement with the experimental spectrum, but again an underestimation below the nominal \u03c0+\u03a30\ncand\u03c0\u2212\u03a3++\ncthresholds.\nConcerning the actual structure of the \u039bc(2595)+the conclusions drawn from the various studies remain ambiguous.\nWhile there is consent that the resonance contains a large meson-baryon component, it remains unclear which of those\ncomponents might be the dominant one. Actually, it seems that the compositeness depends strongly on the number of\nconsidered coupled channels and also on the regularization schemes employed in the course of the unitarization [1224].\n80\n\nSpecifically, in approaches where only (approximate) flavor symmetry is imposed one finds either a dominant \u03c0\u03a3ccom-\nponent or a dominant DNcomponent. On the other hand, models that implement also HQSS often find a large D\u2217N\ncomponent. For example, in the SU(8) spin-flavor scheme of Ref. [1227] the \u039bc(2595)+becomes predominantly a D\u2217N\nquasi-bound state \u2013 though still with important additional binding effects from the DNchannel. Finally, in a recent\nwork by Nieves et al. [1238] even the analogy between the \u039bc(2595)+and the \u039b(1405)is called into question. The study\nis based on the standard Weinberg-Tomozawa (WT) term and incorporates HQSS. However, it addition, it includes also\nthe exchange of resonances from the constituent quark model in the s-channel.\nNow to the \u03a3c(2800), a state which is located very close to the DNthreshold and whose quantum numbers are still\nnot determined [103]. The Juelich potential predicts a dynamically generated S-wave state with mass 2797MeV [276]\nand isospin I=1, and it is quite tempting to identify it with the \u03a3c(2800)[103]. However, there is a caveat because\nthe predicted width is with just about 12MeV significantly smaller than the value of roughly 75\u00b120MeV given by the\nPDG. Since that resonance decays primarily to \u03c0\u039b+\ncthe failure to reproduce the width could be an indication that the\nDN\u2192\u03c0\u039b+\nctransition potential is too small in that model. Most of the other studies do not find states with suitable\nquantum number in that region. Actually, the majority of the predictions suggest masses around or even below 2700MeV\nforS-wave states with I=1. Only in [1231] an isovector state with 2800MeV is predicted, interestingly with t-channel\nvector-meson exchange as driving force just as in the Juelich model, and again with a somewhat too small width.\nIn this context, let us mention that recently evidence against the bound-state nature of the \u03a3c(2800)was reported by\nWang et al. [1234], who studied the state within chiral EFT to NLO, including, however, only the DNandD\u2217Nchannels.\nIn contrast to that, a theoretical analysis of the D0pinvariant-mass spectrum, measured by the LHCb Collaboration in\nthe reaction \u039bb\u2192\u03c0\u2212D0p[1239], supports the existence of a bound state right below the D0pthreshold [1240]. In that\nwork also the DNscattering lengths were extracted. Interestingly, but not really surprising, the obtained values are fairly\nclose to those predicted by the Juelich model [276], thus, giving support to the strength of the DNinteraction generated\nby that potential.\n6.2. XY Zand pentaquark states\nDCC approaches play also an essential role in studies of the structure of the so-called XY Zstates and of possible\npentaquark states, see the reviews [167, 440, 1028, 1241\u20131249]. Many of the new states seen in the charm or bottom\nsectors, which do not fit into the standard quark-antiquark or three-quark classification, have been observed close to\nthresholds. The first and perhaps still most famous one is the \u03c7c1(3872), formerly known as X(3872) [1250], whose\nmass coincides with the D\u00afD\u2217/D\u2217\u00afDthreshold within the experimental uncertainty. Indeed channel coupling and aspects\nassociated with it like threshold anomalies have been revisited in various works since they are considered as possible\nexplanation for the nature and structure of some XY Zand other exotic states, see, e.g., Refs. [1251, 1252] and the review\n[167] for very recent examples.\nSince the focus of the present review are DCC approaches we do not have the ambition and the space to provide an\nadequateoverviewoverthevastamountofstudiesandpublicationsdedicatedtoexoticstatesintheheavysector. Anyway,\nas mentioned above, there are already various excellent and comprehensive reviews available. Accordingly, here we want to\nhighlight a few specific and illustrative systems/works, selected by the criterion that channel coupling plays a decisive role\nfor the physical conclusions drawn in those studies. Accordingly, our emphasis will be on specific meson-baryon systems\ninvolving heavy hadrons where potentially many channels are coupled. In this context the (approximate) heavy-quark\nspin symmetry (HQSS) [1253], a symmetry which requires the dynamics of heavy hadrons to became independent of the\nspin of the constituent heavy quark ( Q=c, b) in the limit mQ\u2192\u221e, plays an important role in a two-fold way. On the\none hand side, it results in mass splittings \u00afD\u2217\u2212\u00afD,\u03a3\u2217\nc\u2212\u03a3c, etc. that are significantly smaller than those between the\nstrange counterparts K\u2217\u2212Kand\u03a3\u2217\u2212\u03a3,\nMK\u2217\u2212MK=396 MeV MD\u2217\u2212MD=141 MeV MB\u2217\u2212MB=45 MeV\nM\u03a3\u2217\u2212M\u03a3=191 MeV M\u03a3\u2217c\u2212M\u03a3c=65 MeV M\u03a3\u2217\nb\u2212M\u03a3b=19 MeV (6.1)\nso that the thresholds of the meson-baryon channels that can be formed are much closer together. In addition it provides\nconstraints on the interaction between the pertinent hadrons and it singles out the relevant channels, which would all\nhave degenerate thresholds in the strict HQSS limit.\nDCC approaches in the heavy sector are characterized by the intention to interpret observed exotic states in terms\nof bound states, commonly referred to as molecules or dynamically generated states. This strategy is motivated by\nthe fact that many of the exotic states seen in experiments are located conspicuously close to thresholds, as mentioned\nabove, which suggests that their nature could be analogous to that of the deuteron. The coupling between channels\nwhose thresholds are fairly close together enhances effectively the overall strength of the interaction in the system, and\nspecifically in channels where the underlying direct interaction is attractive, and, consequently, favors the formation of\nbound states.

Right: The fit to the data is based on a sixth-order polynomial background and three Breit-Wigner\nfunctions representing the pentaquark candidates.\n6.2.1. Hidden-charm pentaquarks\nFirst evidence for two possible pentaquark candidates, the Pc(4380)andPc(4450)(Pc\u00afcin the new convention by the\nPDG [103]), were reported by the LHCb Collaboration in 2015 based on a measurement of the J/\u03c8pinvariant mass\nspectrum via the weak decay \u039b0\nb\u2192J/\u03c8pK\u2212[1254]. Four years later the LHCb Collaboration presented new results by\nexploiting a much larger data sample [1255]. In that work a new structure, the Pc(4312), was found and, in addition,\nthe (former) Pc(4450)resolved into two fairly narrow states, the Pc(4440)andPc(4457), respectively. The mass spectra\nfrom the two LHCb publications are shown in Fig. 57 while the properties of the states are summarized in Tab. 6,\ntogether with there theoretically favored quantum numbers. Another state, the Pc(4338), was identified in the decay\nB0\ns\u2192J/\u03c8p\u00afp[1256]. Note that a detailed overview on pentaquarks, by Karliner and Skwarnicki, is included in the latest\nreview of the PDG [103].\nThe plot on the right-hand side of Fig. 57 reveals already the most interesting aspect, the Pc(4312),Pc(4440)and\nPc(4457)are just below the \u00afD0\u03a3+\ncand \u00afD\u22170\u03a3+\ncthresholds of 4318 and 4460 MeV, respectively. Those channels are two\nof the four primary channels, \u00afD\u03a3c,\u00afD\u03a3\u2217\nc,\u00afD\u2217\u03a3c, and \u00afD\u2217\u03a3\u2217\nc, which are closely connected by HQSS. Other channels of\nrelevance are \u00afD\u039b+\ncand \u00afD\u2217\u039b+\nc, and the hidden-charm channels \u03b7cNand specifically J/\u03c8N, since the latter system is the\none whose invariant mass spectrum was measured in the LHCb experiments.\nBesidesthoseobviouschannels, furtherandalsomorespecialchannelshavebeenconsidered. Forexample, \u00afD\u039bc(2595)+\ncould be of relevance because its threshold, at 4457MeV, coincides exactly with the mass of one of the LHCb pentaquarks\n[1258\u20131260]. Of course, since the \u039bc(2595)+hasJP=1\n2\u2212, then the \u00afD\u039bc(2595)+S-wave state can couple only to P-wave\nstates of J/\u03c8Nand of the primary channels mentioned above and the pentaquark in question should have JP=1\n2+instead\nof1\n2\u2212or3\n2\u2212. There have been also speculations about the role of the \u03c7c1pchannel whose threshold is at 4449 MeV, i.e.,\nright in the pentaquark region [1261]. Also in this case the S-wave is in JP=1\n2\u2212, just like for the D\u039bc(2595)+channel.\nAnother unusual channel is considered in the work of Wu et al. [1260]. Here, the Pc(4457)pentaquark is interpreted as\naJP=1/2+state in the \u00afD0\u039bc(2595)+\u2013\u03c00Pc(4312)DCC system. Finally, let us mention that, in principle, there are also\nthree-body channels like \u00afD\u039b+\nc\u03c0that open in the relevant energy region.\nWhile by far the majority of the works on the pentaquarks that have been published list only the poles, there\nTable 6: Properties of the Pc(4312),Pc(4440),Pc(4457)[1255], the Pc(4380)[1254], and the Pc(4338)[1256] (in MeV).

It\nshould be noted that neither t-channel meson nor u-channel\nbaryon exchange processes for J/\u03c8 N\u2192 J/\u03c8 Nexist.\nAs pointed out in Ref. [ 65], there may be multiple pos-\nsibilities for a given channel to couple to a certain quantumnumber J\nP.

[1262, 1263] and [64].\nare a few which provide results for the J/\u03c8pinvariant-mass spectrum which then can be compared directly with the\nmeasurements [63, 64, 1262, 1263]. We will focus on those works in the following, starting with a discussion of the\npublication of Du et al. [1263]. In their study, all four \u00afD(\u2217)\u03a3(\u2217)\ncchannels are included. Their thresholds are all close\nto the discovered Pcstates and they are all related by HQSS so that their consistent inclusion is anyway demanded\nby that symmetry. Those are called elastic channels by Du et al. In addition, J/\u03c8Nis included as so-called inelastic\nchannel [1262] and, in Ref. [1263], also \u03b7cNand \u00afD(\u2217)\u039b+\nc. The latter step is necessary from a HQSS perspective since\n(\u03b7c, J/\u03c8)form likewise a heavy quark spin doublet, just as (\u00afD,\u00afD\u2217). In the actual calculations three different schemes are\nconsidered [1263]. In scheme I the leading-order (LO) contact potentials in the \u00afD(\u2217)\u03a3(\u2217)\ncchannels are taken into account\nand in the same way the coupling to the S\u2212andD\u2212wave J/\u03c8Nand\u03b7cNchannels. In scheme II, the contributions\nfrom one pion exchange (OPE) are added. The OPE potential is derived in line with chiral effective field theory and the\ninvolved coupling constants are fixed from the measured width of the decay D\u2217+\u2192D0\u03c0+on one hand side, and from\nresults by lattice QCD calculations regarding the coupling to the \u03a3(\u2217)\ncs [1264]. Furthermore, an NLO S-Dcontact term\nfor the \u00afD(\u2217)\u03a3(\u2217)\ncchannels is added to absorb undesired artifacts from the regularization of the OPE potential [1265, 1266].\nFinally, in scheme III, the coupling to the \u00afD(\u2217)\u039b+\ncchannels is added.\nThe evaluation of the J/\u03c8pinvariant mass is illustrated schematically in Fig. 58. Its calculation involves the reaction\namplitudes (T-matrices) for the meson-baryon channels, which are obtained by solving a Lippmann-Schwinger type\nequation. As indicated in the figure, in the intermediate state only the elastic channels are kept. The free parameters of\nthe different schemes are fixed in a fit to the J/\u03c8Ninvariant mass reported by the LHCb collaboration. In fact, that work\ncontains three sets of mJ/\u03c8pdistributions, one that includes all mKpevents, one where only events with mKp>1.9GeV\nare included, and a third set where cos\u03b8Pc-dependent weights are applied to each event candidate [1255] so that the Pc\nsignals are enhanced. In Ref. [1263] Du et al. present a variety of fits, based on the different schemes and for the different\ndata sets, where all of them reproduce the data with fairly similar quality (i.e. similar \u03c72). For illustration, we pick out\nthe one in scheme II and for the cos\u03b8Pcweighted case, see Fig. 59 (right side). One can see that the mass spectrum\nis very well reproduced, including the structure associated with the Pcstates. Note that besides the theoretical J/\u03c8p\ninvariant-mass distribution, evaluated via the mechanism displayed in Fig. 58, a smooth incoherent background has to be\nadded. The latter is indicated by the dotted line.\nExploring the pole structure of the reaction amplitude, the authors found a total of seven Pcstates, for all fits/schemes\nconsidered, and in line with other investigations where HQSS was imposed on the employed interaction models [1267].\nTo be concrete, they identified three states with JP=1\n2\u2212, three states with JP=3\n2\u2212, and one with JP=5\n2\u2212. The lowest\none corresponds to the Pc(4312)with1\n2\u2212and is a \u00afD\u03a3cbound state. There are two \u00afD\u2217\u03a3cbound states, with1\n2\u2212and\n3\n2\u2212, respectively, which in the solution shown in Fig. 59 correspond to a reversed order for Pc(4457)andPc(4440). It\nshould be said that in scheme I the \u201ctheoretically favored\" ordering Pc(4440),Pc(4457), see Table 6, can be realized\ntoo [1262, 1263]. In addition, there is a pole around 4380 MeV, with a dominant \u00afD\u03a3\u2217\nccomponent. This mass is close to\nthe structure reported in the first LHCb paper [1254], however, it is much narrower than the state reported by LHCb.\nFinally, there are three Pcstates (with1\n2\u2212,3\n2\u2212, and5\n2\u2212, respectively) which are \u00afD\u2217\u03a3\u2217\ncbound states and which are located\nclose to the threshold of that channel. Their interpretation is unclear so far, since the mass spectrum from the LHCb\nmeasurement does not show any unambiguous structure in that invariant-mass region.\nThe other study of the LHCb pentaquarks reviewed here is performed by members of the Juelich-Bonn (JB) group\n[63, 64], who likewise presented results for the J/\u03c8pinvariant mass. This DCC study is performed within the traditional\nmeson-exchange picture and can be viewed as an extension of the JB model [53] (see Sect. 2.3) to the heavy sector. It\nincludessixchannels, namely \u00afD\u039b+\nc,\u00afD\u03a3c,\u00afD\u2217\u039b+\nc,\u00afD\u2217\u03a3c,\u00afD\u03a3\u2217\nc, and J/\u03c8N. Thepotentialsactinginthevariouschannelsare\nderived from an effective interaction based on the Lagrangians of Wess and Zumino [98] using time-ordered perturbation\ntheory. They consist of contributions from t-channel meson-exchange processes and also from u-channel baryon exchanges.\nThe former comprise the pseudoscalar mesons \u03c0,\u03b7,\u03b7\u2032and the vector mesons \u03c1,\u03c9, depending on the quantum numbers\nof the involved charmed mesons and baryons. The transition \u00afD(\u2217)\u03a3(\u2217)\nc,\u00afD(\u2217)\u039b+\nc\u2192J/\u03c8Nis mediated by \u00afDand \u00afD\u2217\nexchanges. The coupling constants at the various meson-meson-meson- and baryon-baryon-meson vertices are fixed by\nassuming SU(3) and SU(4) flavor symmetry. The free parameters in the model are the cutoff masses associated with the\nphenomenological form factors that are attached to each vertex. Some of them are determined in the fitting procedure\n83\n\n  764 Page 4 of 10 Eur. Phys. J.

( 8), which is not written explicitly for simplicity, and\nwe only consider the total angular momentum of the J/\u03c8p\nsystem up to J=5/2. According to our test results, 5/2\nis suf\ufb01cient in this analysis, and the contribution of higherangular momenta is completely negligible. Moreover, taking\nhigher angular momenta into account will bring more free\nparameters, which is not supported by the current amountof experimental data. As in Refs. [ 28,71,72] we include thespectator kaon in Eq. ( 8) by an additional momentum fac-\ntor q\nKwith the correct dependence on the orbital angular\nmomentum in different partial waves (centrifugal barrier).\nIn addition, the contribution of an incoherent smooth back-\nground term is considered in Eq. ( 6), which compensates for\nthe tree level diagram of the /Lambda10\nb\u2192 J/\u03c8pK\u2212decay and var-\nious other contributions which are not explicitly included inthe amplitude. Referring to Ref. [ 2], we adopt the polynomial\nform for this background term as:\nT\nbg=a+bs+cs2, (9)\nwhich contains the Mandelstam variable sand free parame-\nters a,band c, and it does not depend on J. In Refs. [ 27\u201329],\nthe authors have con\ufb01rmed that the quality of the \ufb01t and the\nextracted pole results are quite similar regardless of whether\nsuch a background contribution contains a resonant term ornot.\nThe \ufb01tting of the free parameters of Eqs.

It is also worth mentioning that while the separation of scales calls for larger\ncuto\ufb00s, the cuto\ufb00 larger than the c-quark mass, mc/similarequal1.5GeV, may introduce additional\nHQSS breaking e\ufb00ects.\n4.2.2 Description of the data in \u039b0\nb\u2192J/\u03c8pK\u2212\nIn ref. [40], it was found that the inclusion of the OPE singles out a unique solution (the\nsolutionB) from the two almost equivalent ones present for the pure contact potentials.\nHowever, no e\ufb00ects from the S-Dcontact terms were taken into account which, as shown\nin the previous section, does not meet the criteria of renormalizability. Here we improve\non this and discuss the renormalized results as well as their implications for the predicted\nline shapes, as will be shown in the next section. In \ufb01gure 9, we present the best \ufb01t results\nfor solution Bof scheme II for various data sets.\nA general feature of both schemes I and II is that the source couplings PJ\n\u03b1are badly\ndetermined, especially for those of the three \u03a3\u2217\nc\u00afD\u2217bound states, which are almost invisible\nin the line shapes, as can be seen from tables 4 and 5 in appendix B. Also, the couplings to\nthe inelastic channels have sizeable uncertainties. However, the elastic channel interactions,\n\u2013 24 \u2013Figure 59: J/\u03c8pinvariant-mass spectrum measured by the LHCb Collaboration [1255]. Left: Calculation taken from Ref. [64].

Again,\nthe employed reaction amplitudes for the meson-baryon channels are obtained by solving a Lippmann-Schwinger type\nequation. And again only \u00afD(\u2217)\u03a3(\u2217)are kept in the intermediate state. Finally, as in [1263] different solutions are found\nwhich describe the J/\u03c8pinvariant-mass spectrum almost equally well. Out of the three fits presented in Ref. [64] we show\nhere exemplary Fit C, see the left-hand side of Fig. 59.\nAs one can see from the figure, also here a smooth incoherent background was added, which is indicated by the brown\nsolid line. In addition the contributions from the different partial waves are shown, specifically those for J=1\n2(green),\n3\n2(orange), and5\n2(olive). Evidently, the three Pcstates from the recent LHCb measurement are reproduced where\nthePc(4312)appears as a \u00afD\u03a3cbound state with JP=1\n2\u2212and the Pc(4440)andPc(4457)are states with1\n2\u2212and3\n2\u2212,\nrespectively, associated mainly with the \u00afD\u2217\u03a3cchannel. Interestingly, (and different from Fit A and B) in Fit C the pole\nfor the latter is above the threshold, a situation similar to that observed for a possibly strange dibaryon in the \u039bN-\u03a3N\nsystem [169], see Sect. 5.3. The pole around 4366 MeV with3\n2\u2212, a\u00afD\u03a3\u2217\ncbound state, is in line with the structure reported\nin the first LHCb paper, but again it is much narrower than what has been deduced by the experimentalists. Note that,\nbesides the states discussed here, the JB model predicts many more states, from1\n2\u2212up to7\n2\u2212, however, with fairly large\nwidths. Future and more precise experiments might shed light on the question whether these exist or not.\nAsalreadysaidabove, therearemanymoretheoreticalstudiesoftheLHCbpentaquarksemployingvariousapproaches.\nHowever, as far as we could see, they are all restricted to the determination of the poles and no comparison with the\nobserved J/\u03c8pmassspectrumisprovided. Moreover, severalofthoseworksarenotperformedinafactualcoupled-channel\nframework. Nonetheless, we want to mention selectively some of them, namely two of the earliest works [36, 1268],\npublished well before experimental evidence for pentaquark candidates were found, the studies of Meng et al. [1269],\nwhere the interaction is derived within chiral perturbation theory, including contact terms, and one-pion and two-pion\nexchange, a calculation by Xiao et al. [1270], performed with a dynamical input obtained from an extension of the local\nhidden gauge approach, and the works of Wu et al. [1271] and of Zhang [1272], which is based on the conventional\nmeson-exchange approach and where predictions for \u03b3p\u2192J/\u03c8pare provided. Interesting are also works like Ref. [1257]\nwhere hidden-charm pentaquarks are considered and predictions for hidden-bottom pentaquarks are given, see Fig. 60.\nFor yet other prediction of hidden-bottom pentaquarks, see e.g., Ref. [1273].\n6.2.2. Hidden-charm pentaquarks with strangeness\nFirst experimental evidence for a hidden-charm pentaquark candidate with strangeness, the Pcs(4459)0(Pc\u00afcsin the new\nconvention by the PDG [103]), was reported by the LHCb Collaboration in 2020 from an analysis of \u039e\u2212\nb\u2192J/\u03c8\u039bK\u2212\ndecays [1274]. The state is located about 18 MeV below the \u00afD\u22170\u039e0\ncthreshold (4477 MeV) and about 15 MeV above the\none of the \u00afD\u039e\u2032\ncchannel (4444 MeV). Two years later a second candidate was identified, the Pcs(4338), inB\u2212\u2192J/\u03c8\u039b\u00afp\ndecays [1275]. It is located basically at the \u00afD\u039ecthreshold. Very recently, the Pcs(4459)0was also observed by the\nBelle Collaboration [1276], in inclusive decays of \u03a5(1S,2S)toJ/\u03c8\u039b. The J/\u03c8\u039binvariant-mass spectrum measured\nby LHCb, where the Pcs(4459)0was identified, is reproduced in Fig. 61. As one can see from the figure, besides the\nsingle-pentaquark solution (left), the LHCb Collaboration explored also the possibility that there are two states (right),\ninspired by corresponding model predictions of a calculation based on chiral effective field theory up to the next-to-\nleading order [1277]. The masses suggested from that analysis for the pentaquark candidates are 4454.9\u00b12.7MeV and\n84\n\nJHEP11(2019)108\n43004350440044504500\n11 04011 06011 08011 10011 12011 14011 16011 180Figure 13 .

The black dashed lines are the corresponding thresholds.\nHQS can be used to relate the coupling constants to one another, such as the axial\ncoupling constants in the O(\u03b50) Lagrangians. Under HQS, the heavy quarks only serve\nas the spectators. The interaction between \u03a3(\u2217)\ncand \u00afD(\u2217)is mediated by their inner light\ndegrees of freedom, i.e., the light diquarks in \u03a3(\u2217)\ncand the light quark in \u00afD(\u2217). Therefore, the\nS-wave e\ufb00ective potentials between \u03a3(\u2217)\ncand \u00afD(\u2217)at the quark level can be parameterized\nas [11]\nVHQS\nquark\u2212level=Vc+Vsl1\u00b7l2, (6.1)\nwhereVcandVsdenote the central term and spin-spin term, respectively. l1andl2are the\nspins of the light degrees of freedom of the \u03a3(\u2217)\ncand \u00afD(\u2217), respectively. With the potentials\nat the quark level, one can build the relations between di\ufb00erent channels at the hadron\nlevel by parameterizing the hadron level potentials as\nV\u03a3c\u00afD=V1,V\u03a3c\u00afD\u2217=V2+V/prime\n2S1\u00b7S2,\nV\u03a3\u2217c\u00afD=V3,V\u03a3\u2217c\u00afD\u2217=V4+V/prime\n4S1\u00b7S2, (6.2)\nwhereS1andS2are the spin operators of the \u03a3(\u2217)\ncand \u00afD\u2217, respectively.

The yellow bands for the hidden-bottom predictions are an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty.\nstatistic from 10,000 pseudoexperiments for the model based on\nthe results from the \ufb01t to data \ufb01t, generated with the null hypoth-\nesis. To take into account the look-elsewhere effect for each\npseudoexperiment, the global maximum of 2 ln Lis obtained by\nscanning the values of the mass and width of P0\ncsstate in the kine-\nmatically allowed region, instead of limiting their values to be con-\nsistent with that of the data \ufb01t. When including systematic\nuncertainties discussed below, the p-value is determined to be\n0.2% by counting the fraction of pseudoexperiments with the\nD2l nLvalue exceeding the smallest D2l nLvalue from data. This\np-value corresponds to the signal signi\ufb01cance of 3 :1rwith a\ntwo-sided Gaussian test for the P0\ncsstate, providing the \ufb01rst evi-\ndence for a charmonium pentaquark candidate with strangeness.\nAs shown in Fig. 3 , the projections of the full amplitude \ufb01t onto\ntheKK/C0andJ=wKinvariant mass spectra match the data distribu-\ntions well. A test of the \ufb01t quality is performed by comparing the\ndefault \ufb01t of the Dalitz plot with the data distribution. The data\nis divided into 64 bins containing approximately the same number\nof decays. The v2is calculated to be 77 for these bins, indicating a\nreasonably good description of the data. The P0\ncsstate is determined\nto have a mass of 4458 :8/C62:9\u00f0stat\u00deMeV and a width of\n17:3/C66:5\u00f0stat\u00deMeV, and hereafter is denoted as Pcs4459\u00f0\u00de0.\nFig. 4 highlights the Pcs4459\u00f0\u00de0contribution by comparing the \ufb01ts\nto the mJ=wKand cos hPcsdistributions with and without the\nPcs4459\u00f0\u00de0state included, where hPcsis the helicity angle of the\nJ=wKsystem, de\ufb01ned as the angle between the direction of the\nJ=wparticle and the opposite direction of the K/C0particle in the\nJ=wKrest frame. The Pcs4459\u00f0\u00de0state is more visible when the\ndominant contributions from N/C3/C0with low masses are suppressed\nby requiring mKK/C0>2:2 GeV. As shown in Fig. 4b , a signi\ufb01cant\nimprovement of the \ufb01t quality is also found in the cos hPcsdistribu-\ntion when including the Pcs4459\u00f0\u00de0state.No evidence for any other P0\ncsstate is found in the considered\nmass range. This is also clear when examining the mJ=wKprojections\nin three intervals of mKK/C0, shown in Fig. 5 . The measured mass,\nwidth and \ufb01t fraction (FF) of all components involved in the default\n\ufb01t are shown in Table 2 . Systematic uncertainties on these results\nare discussed below.\nThe measured Pcs4459\u00f0\u00de0mass is about 19 MeV below the N0\nc/C22D/C30\nthreshold. In this region, Ref. [11] predicts two states with\nJP\u00bc1=2/C0and 3 =2/C0and a mass difference of 6 MeV. This is similar\nto the two Pc4440\u00f0\u00de\u00feand Pc4457\u00f0\u00de\u00fepentaquark states, which are\njust below the R\u00fe\nc/C22D/C30threshold. Thus the hypothesis of a two-\npeak structure with the predicted JPvalues is tested. The \ufb01t pro-\nvides a good description of the data. The result is shown for the\nP0\ncsenhanced region in Fig. 6 . The masses and widths of the two\nstates are 4454 :9/C62:7 MeV and 7 :5/C69:7 MeV, and 4467 :8/C63:7\nMeV and 5 :2/C65:3 MeV, respectively, where the uncertainties are\nstatistical only. The \ufb01t improves 2 ln Lby 4.8 units for 4 additional\nfree parameters, compared to the \ufb01t using one Breit-Wigner func-\ntion to model the structure. Therefore, the analysis of the current\ndata sample cannot con\ufb01rm or refute the two-peak hypothesis.\nSystematic uncertainties are summarised in Table 3 . Due to the\nlimited number of candidates, JPfor the P0\ncsstate and for the\nN1690\u00f0\u00de/C0,N1950\u00f0\u00de/C0andN2030\u00f0\u00de/C0states cannot be reliably deter-\nmined. To estimate the systematic uncertainty related to the\nchoice of JPassignments, all possible JPassignments for these states\nresulting in /C02l nLdifferences less than 9 units are compared to\nthat from the default \ufb01t. The largest variation, with respect to\nthe values in the default \ufb01t, is taken as an asymmetric systematic\nuncertainty. The uncertainty related to the \ufb01t model is estimated\nby: varying the hadron-size parameter in the Blatt-Weisskopf bar-\nrier factor [3]between 1.0 and 5 :0 GeV/C01; modifying the orbital\nangular momenta LinN/C0\nbdecays that are used in the treatment\nFig. 3.

The largest value among all model vari-\nations is taken as systematic uncertainty for this source. The other\nsystematic sources are estimated by: including the K!pp/C0decay\nangles instead of taking the Kbaryon as a stable \ufb01nal-state parti-\ncle; determining the sWeights by either splitting N/C3/C0helicity\nangles into bins or removing partially reconstructed physical back-\nground from the N/C0\nb!J=wR0!Kc \u00f0\u00de K/C0decays in the [5644.5,\n5764.5] MeV J=wKK/C0mass sideband; and varying the ef\ufb01ciency\ndue to imperfect simulation. The mass resolution of the KK/C0sys-\ntem is about 1\u20132 MeV, and has negligible effect on the \ufb01t due to\nthe large widths of the N/C3/C0states. The signi\ufb01cance for the\nPcs4459\u00f0\u00de0state is conservatively taken as the smallest signi\ufb01cance\nfound when combining different sources of systematic uncertainty\ntogether, and is equal to 3.1 r, as already reported, where the look-\nelsewhere effect has been taken into account. It corresponds to\nvarying the hadron-size parameter in the extended N/C3/C0model with\nfull couplings for the considered Pcs4459\u00f0\u00de0state.\nThe negative systematic uncertainty for the Pcs4459\u00f0\u00de0\ufb01t frac-\ntion, /C01:3%, is obtained from an alternative value of JPused for\nthe Pcs4459\u00f0\u00de0state. In such a \ufb01t, the signi\ufb01cance of the\nPcs4459\u00f0\u00de0state is 4.1 r, even though the \ufb01t fraction is 1 :4%. This\nis because the signi\ufb01cance has contributions from two sources,\nthe \ufb01t fraction and the interference fraction involving the\nPcs4459\u00f0\u00de0state. The interference fraction is about \u00fe1:3%in this\nalternative JP\ufb01t, while it is almost 0 in the default \ufb01t. The system-\natic uncertainty of the N1950\u00f0\u00de/C0\ufb01t fraction is \u00fe49:9%, most of\nwhich originates from an alternative \ufb01t where its mass and width\nare \ufb02oated in the extended model, rather than constrained to the\nknown values [13], while the second largest one, from other\nFig. 5.

The quantum numbers predicted by theory [1277] are JP=1\n2\u2212and3\n2\u2212, respectively.\nA first study of the nature of the Pcs(4459)0within a DCC approach was presented by Du et al. [1278]. Besides J/\u03c8\u039b,\nout of the many \u00afD(\u2217)\u039e(\u2217)\ncand\u00afD(\u2217)\u039e\u2032\ncopen-charm channels only those whose thresholds are close to the observed structure\nwere taken into account, namely \u00afD\u039e\u2032\ncand\u00afD\u2217\u039ec. The calculation was performed in a leading-order EFT-type ansatz with\nthe potentials represented by constant terms. For the considered channels constraints from HQSS were implemented.\nThe reaction amplitude is established in the on-shell factorization approximation where the one-loop two-point Green\u2019s\nfunction is evaluated in the dimensional regularization scheme [1278]. The 8 parameters of the model, three that specify\nthe interaction in the \u00afD\u039e\u2032\ncand \u00afD\u2217\u039ecchannels, two for the coupling of those channels to J/\u03c8\u039b, and three related to the\nelementary decay (production) vertices, are fitted to the mass spectrum. The result is shown in Fig. 62 (right). One can\nsee that the potential considered by Du et al. leads indeed to a two-state structure of the observed pentaquark. Both\nare dominated by the \u00afD\u2217\u039ecchannel, where the lower state corresponds to1\n2\u2212and the higher one to3\n2\u2212. Note that the\ngreenish area indicates the fitting region. It should be mentioned that in Ref. [1278] some other scenarios are discussed\ntoo, with just two coupled channels, and in some only a single structure appears. In addition the authors considered a\nperturbative treatment of the \u00afD\u039e\u2032\ncchannel.\nDCC results for the invariant-mass spectrum were also presented by Zhu et al. [1279]. In that study a total of nine\ncoupled channels are considered: J/\u03c8\u039b,\u00afD(\u2217)\u039e\u2032\nc,\u00afD(\u2217)\u039ec,\u00afD(\u2217)\u039e\u2217\nc,\u00afD(\u2217)\ns\u039b+\nc. The work is performed within the conventional\nmeson-exchange picture, where the exchanges of pseudoscalar ( \u03c0,\u03b7) and vector ( \u03c1,\u03c9) mesons are considered, and in\naddition a scalar-isoscalar ( \u03c3) meson. Furthermore, the transition to the \u00afD(\u2217)\ns\u039b+\ncchannels is mediated by KandK\u2217\nexchange and the one to the J/\u03c8\u039bchannel by D, D\u2217andDs, D\u2217\nsexchanges, respectively. The coupling constants for all\npseudoscalar and vector mesons are fixed assuming SU(4) symmetry. The reaction amplitude is obtained by solving a\nLS-type equation for the coupled-channel potentials, where the latter are furnished with Gaussian form factors. Their\n85\n\npeak from the molecular states, the direct results from\nthe current coupled-channel calculation provide a back-\nground contributions in the J=\u03c8\u039binvariant mass spectrum\n(see green curves in Fig. 2).

After removing\nsuch background, the results from the molecular states are\nextracted, and in good line with the experimental data. Tofind the best comparison with experiment with bin of\n6 MeV , the contributions of two \u039e\nc\u00afD/C3states with spin\nparity 1=2\u2212and3=2\u2212exhibit as one peak. If we adjust bin\nto a smaller value, 1 MeV, in the lower panel of Fig. 2, the\ncontributions from the two states are distinguishable. It\nshows that the peak of P\u039b\u03c8s\u00f04459 \u00demay be composed of a\nhigher narrow \u039ec\u00afD/C3state with JP\u00bc3=2\u2212and a lower\nwider \u039ec\u00afD/C3state with JP\u00bc1=2\u2212.\nTo provide more explicit of the contributions from these\ntwo\u039ec\u00afD/C3states, the poles and the invariant mass spectrum\nfor different spin parities will be presented. The results for\nspin party 1=2\u2212is illustrated in Fig. 3. In the single-channel\ncalculation, where two poles are found on the real axis near\nthe\u039e0c\u00afDand\u039ec\u00afD/C3thresholds, respectively. After including\nthe coupled-channel effect, the poles leave the real axis and\nbecome two conjugate poles in the complex energy planes,which indicates that the bound states acquire width. The\n\u039ec\u00afD/C3state with spin parity 1=2\u2212has a mass of 4465 MeV\nand a width of 18 MeV. The structure P\u039b\u03c8s\u00f04459 \u00depeak can\neven be well describe by the peak of state \u039ec\u00afD/C3\u00f01=2\u2212\u00de,\nexcept for the data points at about 4453 MeV.

Unfor-\ntunately, the precisions of the experiment are not highenough to identify its existence. The calculation also\nsuggests to observe such state in the \u039b\nc\u00afDsinvariant mass\nspectrum.\nIn Fig. 4, the results for spin parity 3=2\u2212are presented.\nThe\u039ec\u00afD/C3state with 3=2\u2212, as well as that with 1=2\u2212,i s\nproduced near the threshold with a mass of 4457 MeV .

The\npeak of the state \u039ec\u00afD/C3\u00f03=2\u2212\u00deis so narrow that it can only\nraise the events near the central value and not affect much\nof the general shape of the invariant mass spectrum. The\npeak with cutoff \u039b\u00bc1.14falls in the middle of two highest\ndata points. If a little larger cutoff \u039b\u00bc1.18is adopted, the\npeak will move to the lower highest data point. The state\n\u039e/C3c\u00afD\u00f03=2\u2212\u00dehas a mass of about 4512 MeV and a width of\nabout 17 MeV . The low yield of the events with JP\u00bc3=2\u2212\nindicates that high precision data are required to observe the\n\u039e/C3c\u00afD\u00f03=2\u2212\u00deinJ=\u03c8\u039binvariant mass spectrum.

D 107, 034029 (2023)\n034029-6\nWe have also tested the case of allowing a linear s\ndependence in the \u039ec\u00afD/C3interacting channels, so that C1\n2\u2192\nC1\n2\u00f0s\nM2\nCDD\u22121\u00dein Eq. (29). The position of the zero is called\nM2\nCDD, because in the case of the \u039ec\u00afD/C3one-channel\nscattering it would be a CDD pole [36,61] . However, the\nsolution found with the smallest \u03c72always gives rise to a\npole in the first or physical RS, which is not admissible.\nThis is related to the fact that these fits of smallest \u03c72\nproduce C1\n2<0, which allows the vanishing of the denom-\ninator of the one-channel Tmatrix,\n1\nC1=2\u00f0s=M2\nCDD\u22121\u00de\u00feG2\u00f0s\u00de: \u00f030\u00de\nThis can be easily seen because \u2111G2\u00f0s\u00de<0for\u2111s>0in\nthe first RS, and then it has opposite sign to s/C3=C 1\n2forC1\n2<0. The absence of an acceptable solution with a\nnearby CDD pole is in favor of interpreting the Pcs\u00f04459 \u00de\nas a dynamically generated resonance, i.e., a \u039ec\u00afD/C3molecu-\nlar state.\nNext, we include together the two angular momenta J\u00bc\n1=2and 3=2, and then we have two more free parameters\nC3\n2andd3\n2,\nV3\n2\u00bc/C180g\ngC 3\n2/C19\n;P 3\n2\u00bc/C180\nd3\n2/C19\n: \u00f031\u00de\nAccording to Eq.

REV. D 104, 114034 (2021)\n114034-9Figure 62: Results for the J/\u03c8\u039binvariant-mass spectrum, taken from Refs. [1278] (right) and [1279] (left). Data are by the LHCb Collaboration\nfrom the \u039e\u2212\nb\u2192J/\u03c8\u039bK\u2212decays [1274].\ncutoff masses (one for the light mesons and one for D(\u2217), D(\u2217)\ns) are free parameters. The other free parameters are related\nto the elementary decay (production) vertices; there is one for the J=1/2channel and one for 3/2. Note that in this\nwork the invariant-mass spectrum is evaluated in the Migdal-Watson approximation [1280, 1281], i.e., it is assumed to be\nproportional to the square of the meson-baryon reaction amplitudes times the phase space factor.\nThe resulting invariant-mass spectrum is shown in Fig. 62 (left). In the upper panel the outcome of the calculation\nis adapted to the experimental bin width of 6 MeV, while in the lower panel a bin width of only 1 MeV is assumed. In\nboth cases from the full calculation (green curves) a background is subtracted (black curves) so that the resonance signals\ncan be isolated and a comparison with the LHCb data can be made [1279]. Zhu et al. report four poles in the energy\nregion displayed in Fig. 62, namely at 4423 MeV ( \u00afD\u039e\u2032\nc,1\n2\u2212), at 4457 MeV ( \u00afD\u2217\u039ec,3\n2\u2212), at 4465 MeV ( \u00afD\u2217\u039ec,1\n2\u2212), and at\n4512 MeV ( \u00afD\u039e\u2217\nc,3\n2\u2212), where the dominant channel is indicated in the brackets. Obviously, the experimental signal of the\nPcs(4459)pentaquark is primarily reproduced by the1\n2\u2212state with 4465 MeV. The near-by3\n2\u2212state predicted by this\nmodel is too narrow to be seen when the bin width is 6 MeV. The same is true for the1\n2\u2212state with 4423 MeV. Note that\nthe potential of Zhu et al. produces also a pole around 4336.5 MeV, dominated by the strong coupling between \u00afDs\u039band\n\u00afD\u039ec, which could be identified with the Pcs(4338)pentaquark of the LHCb collaboration.\nIn Ref. [1282] another coupled-channel calculation based on dynamics generated by one-boson exchange can be found.\nThe channels included are \u00afD(\u2217)\u039e\u2032(\u2217)\nc,\u00afD(\u2217)\u039e(\u2217)\nc. The interaction is deduced from the one for \u00afD(\u2217)\u03a3(\u2217)\ncby using heavy\nquark symmetry and SU(3) flavor symmetry, where the latter is fixed from a fit to the Pcstates established by LHCb.\nOnly poles are reported but no J/\u03c8\u039binvariant-mass distribution. Results for the resonance spectrum are shown in\nFig. 63. A similar coupled-channel study has been presented in Ref. [1283] very recently. Finally, in Ref. [1284] one\ncan find a coupled-channel calculation performed with a dynamical input obtained from an extension of the local hidden\ngauge approach. Also here there are no predictions for the invariant-mass distribution.\n6.2.3. Other heavy systems\nChannel coupling plays also a role in the interpretation of the exotic XY Zstates and the doubly charmed tetraquark state\nT+\ncc, observed in meson-meson systems. Most studies in this field are based on the chiral unitary approach or comparable\nformalisms and exploit the on-shell factorization to simplify the calculations. However, whenever vector mesons like\nK\u2217,D\u2217, orB\u2217are involved pion exchange is possible and generates a long-ranged interaction that couples the different\nchannels. In particular, the strong tensor force induced by pion exchange leads to a coupling between the S-wave (where\nmolecules/bound states are primarily expected) and the D-wave. These aspects are considered only in a small number of\nworks because it requires a much more elaborate and tedious computational treatment.\n86\n\nwith I\u00f0JP\u00de\u00bc0\u00f01=2\u2212\u00deand 1\u00f01=2\u2212\u00deand the coupled\n\u039e0c\u00afD/C3=\u039e/C3c\u00afD/C3state with 1\u00f01=2\u2212\u00de, where the other binding\nenergies \u02dcE\u00bcE\u00fe\u00f0Mlowest\u2212Mdominant \u00deare around\n100 MeV , the corresponding dominant channels are \u039e0c\u00afD\nand\u039e/C3c\u00afD/C3, respectively. Compared to the coupled\n\u039ec\u00afD=\u039e0c\u00afD=\u039ec\u00afD/C3=\u039e0c\u00afD/C3=\u039e/C3c\u00afD/C3states with I\u00f0JP\u00de\u00bc\n0\u00f01=2\u2212\u00deand 1\u00f01=2\u2212\u00de, the cutoff value in the coupled\n\u039e0c\u00afD/C3=\u039e/C3c\u00afD/C3state with 1\u00f01=2\u2212\u00deis a little away from the\nempirical value \u039baround 1.00 GeV .\nFor the \u039ec\u00afD=\u039e0c\u00afD=\u039ec\u00afD/C3=\u039e0c\u00afD/C3=\u039e/C3c\u00afD/C3interactions, if we\nrecall that such interactions are obtained by adding the lowest\nchannel from the \u039e0c\u00afD=\u039ec\u00afD/C3=\u039e0c\u00afD/C3=\u039e/C3c\u00afD/C3interactions, it is\nnot strange to find the analogous results in the \u039e0c\u00afD=\n\u039ec\u00afD/C3=\u039e0c\u00afD/C3=\u039e/C3c\u00afD/C3interactions. Thus, the \u039ec\u00afD=\u039e0c\u00afD=\n\u039ec\u00afD/C3=\u039e0c\u00afD/C3=\u039e/C3c\u00afD/C3tightly bound states with 0;1\u00f01=2\u2212\u00de\nhere are not the independent states, but correspond to the\n\u039e0c\u00afDloosely bound molecular pentaquarks with 0;1\u00f01=2\u2212\u00de.\nIV. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\nAs a hot issue in the hadron physics, whether the new\nhadron states are the hadronic molecules is still open todiscuss. In 2019, the discovery of the three P\ncstates could\nprovide a strong evidence of the existence of the hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks [39]. In Ref. [40], the\nP\nc\u00f04312 \u00de,Pc\u00f04440 \u00de, and Pc\u00f04457 \u00destates can be assigned\nas the \u03a3c\u00afDmolecular state with 1=2\u00f01=2\u2212\u00de, the\u03a3c\u00afD/C3states\nwith 1=2\u00f01=2\u2212\u00deand1=2\u00f03=2\u2212\u00de, respectively. This is not\nthe end of the story. Very recently, the LHCb collaborationreported a new evidence of the strange hidden-charm\npentaquark P\ncs\u00f04459 \u00dein the \u039e\u2212\nb\u2192J=\u03c8\u039bK\u2212process.\nTheorists also proposed that the Pcs\u00f04459 \u00decan be the\nstrange hidden-charm molecular state composed of the\nS-wave \u039ec\u00afD/C3state [65\u201369].\nIn this work, we preform the coupled channel analysis on\nthe interactions between a charm-strange baryon \u039e\u00f00;/C3\u00de\ncand\nan anticharmed meson \u00afD\u00f0/C3\u00dein the framework of the OBE\nmodel. By using the SU\u00f03\u00deflavor symmetry and the heavy\nquark symmetry, we can obtain the OBE effective potential\nrelations between the \u039e\u00f00;/C3\u00de\nc\u00afD\u00f0/C3\u00deinteractions and the\n\u03a3\u00f0/C3\u00de\nc\u00afD\u00f0/C3\u00deinteractions, where we have already deduced\nthe concrete OBE effective potentials in Ref. [40].F o r\nthe\u039ec\u00afD\u00f0/C3\u00desystems, their SU\u00f03\u00deflavor partners are the\n\u039bc\u00afD\u00f0/C3\u00desystems, which is not prepared in our former work.\nIn this work, we derive the corresponding OBE effectivepotentials in the general procedures.\nOur results can predict several possible hidden-charm\nmolecular pentaquarks with strangeness jSj\u00bc1. As shown\nin Fig. 3, there can exist seven possible isoscalar hidden-\ncharm molecular pentaquarks with jSj\u00bc1, they are mainly\ncomposed of the \u039e\n0c\u00afDstate with I\u00f0JP\u00de\u00bc0\u00f01=2\u2212\u00de, the\n\u039ec\u00afD/C3state with 0\u00f03=2\u2212\u00de, the\u039e/C3c\u00afDstate with 0\u00f03=2\u2212\u00de, the\n\u039e0c\u00afD/C3states with 0\u00f01=2\u2212;3=2\u2212\u00de, and the \u039e/C3c\u00afD/C3states with\n0\u00f01=2\u2212;3=2\u2212\u00de, respectively. The \u039e/C3c\u00afD/C3state with 0\u00f05=2\u2212\u00demay be also the possible strange hidden-charm molecular\ncandidate. Meanwhile, we find there may exist three\nisovector hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks with\njSj\u00bc1, like the \u039e0c\u00afDstate with 1\u00f01=2\u2212\u00de, the\u039e/C3c\u00afDstate\nwith 1\u00f03=2\u2212\u00de, and the \u039e0c\u00afD/C3state with 1\u00f03=2\u2212\u00de. Our results\nalso indicate that the coupled channel effect plays a very\nimportant role in forming these hidden-charm molecularcandidates with strangeness jSj\u00bc1, especially for the\n\u039e\n0c\u00afD=\u039ec\u00afD/C3=\u039e0c\u00afD/C3=\u039e/C3c\u00afD/C3coupled states with I\u00f0JP\u00de\u00bc\n0;1\u00f01=2\u2212\u00de, the \u039e/C3c\u00afD=\u039e0c\u00afD/C3=\u039e/C3c\u00afD/C3coupled state with\n0\u00f03=2\u2212\u00de, and the \u039e0c\u00afD/C3=\u039e/C3c\u00afD/C3coupled states with\n0;1\u00f03=2\u2212\u00de. We are looking forward that the future experi-\nments can search for possible hidden-charm pentaquarkswith strangeness around these predicted mass thresholds.\nCompared to the P\ncstates assigned to the meson-baryon\nmolecules, as shown in Fig. 3, there are four more possible\nhidden-charm molecular pentaquarks with strangeness\njSj\u00bc1, which include one isoscalar \u039ec\u00afD/C3state with\n3=2\u2212and three isovector bound states. In our previous\nwork [65,67] , the Pcs\u00f04459 \u00decan be explained as the\nisoscalar \u039ec\u00afD/C3state with 3=2\u2212, and the \u039e/C3c\u00afDchannel is\nalso very important. As we have seen, the mass difference\nbetween the \u039bc\u00afD/C3and\u03a3c\u00afD/C3systems is much larger than\nthat between the \u039ec\u00afD/C3and\u039e/C3c\u00afDsystems, which can\nweaken the contribution from the coupled channel effect,\nthis may explain the reason why there cannot exist the\npossible hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks composed of\nthe\u039bc\u00afD/C3state with 1=2\u00f03=2\u2212\u00de.\nAs shown in Table I, the OBE interactions for the isovector\n\u039e\u00f00;/C3\u00de\nc\u00afD\u00f0/C3\u00desystems are weaker repulsive or stronger attractive\nthan those from the \u03a3\u00f0/C3\u00de\nc\u00afD\u00f0/C3\u00desystems with I\u00bc3=2.T h i si s\nthe main reason that we may predict three isovector strangehidden-charm molecular pentaquarks instead of the hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks with I\u00bc3=2[40].FIG. 3. A summary of the mass spectrum of the Pcstates in the\nmeson-baryon molecular scenario [40]and the predicted possible\nhidden-charm molecular pentaquarks candidates with jSj\u00bc1.\nHere, we roughly estimate the mass positions of the predictedhidden-charm molecular pentaquarks according to the values ofthe cutoff \u039b. The red and green lines label the predicted molecular\ncandidates with I\u00bc0andI\u00bc1, respectively.MASS BEHAVIOR OF HIDDEN-CHARM OPEN-STRANGE \u2026 PHYS. REV. D 105, 014029 (2022)\n014029-7Figure 63: Hidden-charm open-strange pentaquarks predicted in Ref. [1282] based on an interaction established in the hidden-charm sector.\nExperimentally established states are indicated by blue bars.\nOne state where pion exchange plays an essential and delicate role is the aforementioned \u03c7c1(3872) [1250], discovered\nin the \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212J/\u03c8channel, and located extremely close to the \u00afD\u22170D0threshold. Since the D\u22170mass itself is very close to\ntheD0\u03c00threshold, a pion exchanged in the coupled D\u00afD\u2217-D\u2217\u00afDsystem can go on shell, in other words the D\u00afD\u03c0channel\nopens right in the crucial region where the bound state is located. This makes a proper inclusion of the three-body D\u00afD\u03c0\nunitarity cuts mandatory if one wants to obtain reliable results [1030]. See also the discussion in Sect. 2.7.\nPion exchange plays likewise an important role in case of the tetraquark candidate T+\ncc, observed in the D0D0\u03c0+\nspectrum [1285]. The structure is located just about 300 keV below the D\u2217+D0threshold. Also here the exchanged pion\ncan go on shell so that it is necessary to include three-body effects [295, 1032].\nRegarding systems involving the bottom mesons B(\u2217),\u00afB(\u2217)the overall conditions are similar but differ in important\ndetails. Here, the Zb(10610)andZb(10650)states have been observed by Belle in the invariant-mass distributions of\nthe\u03a5(nS)\u03c0\u00b1(n=1,2,3) and hb(mP)\u03c0pm(m=1,2) subsystems of the dipion transitions from \u03a5(10860)[1286]. They\nare located close to the B\u00afB\u2217andB\u2217\u00afB\u2217thresholds. Since the separation between the \u00afBB,\u00afBB\u2217-\u00afB\u2217B,\u00afB\u2217B\u2217channels is\nsmaller than the pion mass, see Eqs. (6.1), the opening of three-body channels involving the pion does not play a role. On\nthe other hand, the coupling between \u00afBBand\u00afBB\u2217-\u00afB\u2217Bto\u00afB\u2217B\u2217becomes more important as compared to the charmed\ncounterpart. Various aspects of the coupled-channel dynamics like the role of pion exchange (and also \u03b7exchange) and\nthe coupling between S- and D-waves were addressed in Refs. [1265, 1287].\nAnother state where coupled-channel dynamics has been advocated for explaining its structure, is the X(6900)ob-\nserved in the invariant-mass spectrum of J/\u03c8pairs, produced in proton-proton collisions [1288]. In the study of Dong et\nal. [1289] the channels J/\u03c8\u2212J/\u03c8,\u03c8(2S)\u2212J/\u03c8, and \u03c8(3770)\u2212J/\u03c8are considered, motivated by the observation that the\n\u03c8(2S)\u2212J/\u03c8threshold (6783 MeV) coincides with the dip seen in the invariant mass while the \u03c8(3770)\u2212J/\u03c8threshold\nis close to the sharp peak in the experimental spectrum. It should be said, however, that the dynamics considered in this\nwork is restricted to a pure contact coupled-channel short-range potential. Note that there is a recent update [1290], where\nadditional new from ATLAS [1291] and CMS [1292] were considered in combination with the previous LHCb results.\nFinally, let us point to the work of Malabarba et al. [492], where hidden-charm states with a possible three-body\nnature have been studied by considering the ND\u00afD\u2217-ND\u2217\u00afDsystems within a Faddeev-type approach based on the fixed\ncenter approximation. Thereby the dynamics in the DNsystem, discussed in Sect. 6.1, is combined with the assumption\nthat the D\u00afD\u2217-D\u2217\u00afDsubsystems form bound states corresponding to the \u03c7c1(3872)and the Zc(3900)states.\n7. Summary and outlook\nDynamical coupled-channel approaches are a versatile tool to study hadron dynamics in different context. Historically,\nthey arose as data in wide kinematic ranges and for different reactions became available, calling for a unified analysis and\ninterpretation of different data within one overarching formalism. Uniting principles of S-matrix theory with the option to\nincorporate microscopic dynamics of underlying theories (strong and electroweak interactions), they became a universal\ntool in baryon spectroscopy and beyond. As discussed, they allow to describe hadronic reactions with known initial\n87\n\nstates such as pions, real and virtual photon probes, but also neutrino-induced reactions and baryon-baryon interactions.\nThey also allow to parametrize the final-state interaction in the mesonic sector with three-body decays. Owing to their\nformulation, DCC approaches are particularly suited to incorporate full three-body dynamics while maintaining three-\nbody unitarity.\nIn this review the emphasis lies on two out of several DCC approaches, the ANL-Osaka and the Juelich-Bonn-\nWashington approach (JBW). They have been used in the analysis of light baryons, but they are both members of a\nlarger family of DCC approaches addressing mesons with two and three-body dynamics and baryon-baryon interactions\n(light, strange, and heavy), as well as the exotic XY Zand pentaquark states, that often require to map out complicated\nthreshold dynamics. DCC approaches also allow to describe and predict hadronic phenomena such as cusps, three-body\nthresholds, triangle singularities and dynamical resonance generation, all of which have been discussed in this review.\nDCC approaches become a bridge connecting various areas of hadron spectroscopy bundling searches for new excited\nstates across different initial states, or studies of electromagnetic transition form factors across different final states. They\nalso connect to functional methods, or, most recently, infinite volume mappings of finite volume spectra obtained in\nLattice QCD.\nWith new experiments being commissioned exploring various strangeness sectors and higher photon virtualities at BE-\nSIII, CERN (AMBER, COMPASS), ELSA, Jefferson Lab, J-PARC, MAMI, SIS100, and other facilities, DCC approaches\nare well positioned for coming decades exploring the transition region from perturbative to non-perturbative QCD, and\nthe interplay with electroweak probes, with the option to match to low-energy effective QCD and with perspectives to\nconnect even larger data sets across different flavor sectors.\nDCC approaches deal with new data coming from high-precision modern facilities but, also, include data from decades\nago, often with unknown systematic effects. This calls for utilization of modern statistical tools beyond \u03c72minimization.\nThe input from Bayesian statistics and machine learning for DCC approaches will help in analyzing the large, inhomoge-\nneous data sets that DCC approaches usually deal with. Planned experiments with, e.g., meson beams will substantially\nhelp in this endeavor and provide further analysis opportunities for DCC approaches.\nThe neutrino interaction in the N\u2217region plays crucial role in neutrino physics, especially for the analysis of long base\nline neutrino experiments. DCC models well constrained from the electromagnetic reactions are in a good position to\ndescribe the electroweak reactions in the N\u2217region. With further theoretical or experimental inputs on the axial vector\nresponse of nucleon, such as parity-violating asymmetry of electron scattering, DCC approaches will play an important\nin neutrino physics.\nWhen data becomes more and more abundant, novel data driven machine learning and AI tools \u2013 ranging from hands-\non tools like LASSO or information criteria, to neural networks or more involved architectures such as transformers \u2013\nbecome more relevant. Application of such techniques and integration thereof into dynamical coupled channel formalisms\nis an exciting avenue for future explorations.\nAcknowledgment\nThe authors thank Luis \u00c1lvarez Ruso, Vadim Baru, Evgeny Epelbaum, Jeremy Green, Feng-Kun Guo, Hiroyuki Kamano,\nT.-S.

Among them, soccer, widely celebrated as \u201cthe beautiful game\u201d,\nholds a particularly prominent position, engaging billions of fans\nworldwide through its universal appeal and intricate strategies. Re-\ncent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming soccer\nunderstanding and viewing experiences by enabling automated\ntactical analysis [ 47,53] and enriching fan engagement through\nautomatic content generation [38, 40, 43, 44].\nGenerally speaking, existing AI research in soccer understanding\nstill faces two challenges: (i) limited focus on reasoning tasks ,\nexisting work primarily focus on visual perception tasks, such as\naction spotting [ 7,13] and foul recognition [ 21,22], which solely\nrely on visual content analysis. However, more reasoning tasks\noften require the assistance of extra context or knowledge, for ex-\nample, answering \u201cHow many goals and assists did this ball-carrying\nplayer make in the 2019-2020 season?\u201d would require both visual\nathlete identification and knowledge retrieval; (ii) fragmented\nand specialist models , most studies typically propose to develop\nspecialist models for isolated tasks, that can be potentially labor-\nintensive and challenging to scale. The heterogeneous annotation\nformats across distinct tasks further impede the development of\ngeneralist models and comprehensive evaluations. This contrasts\nwith modern paradigms for multimodal video understanding that\nemphasize generalization and adaptability.\nIn this paper, we introduce the task of knowledge-based question-\nanswering for the comprehensive and standardized evaluation of\nsoccer understanding. Given the reliance on soccer domain knowl-\nedge, we first construct SoccerWiki , a large-scale multimodal\nsoccer-specific knowledge base, comprising extensive information\nabout 9,471 players, 266 teams, 202 referees, and 235 venues from\nthe Internet. By integrating SoccerWiki and various existing soccer\ndatasets [ 5,7,22,38,43,44] through an automated data curation\npipeline and manual verification, we establish SoccerBench , the\nlargest and most comprehensive benchmark for soccer understand-\ning to date, featuring around 10K multi-choice question-answering\nsamples across 13distinct soccer-specific analysis tasks, for ex-\nample, on background knowledge ,match situation ,camera statusclassification ,jersey number recognition ,jersey colors ,camera sta-\ntus switching ,replay grounding ,action classification ,commentary\ngeneration , and multi-view foul recognition .\nDespite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Mod-\nels (MLLMs) [ 3,27,33,50], soccer understanding remains challeng-\ning due to its complexity and knowledge-intensive nature. General-\npurpose MLLMs, constrained by their limited soccer-specific prior\nknowledge, struggle to address the diverse and highly specialized\nquestions posed in SoccerBench . To tackle this, we propose Soc-\ncerAgent , a novel multi-agent system, as illustrated in Figure1.\nSoccerAgent leverages a powerful agent core [ 32] capable of in-\nvoking 18 specialized tools (with 17 of them being open-source ).\nGiven a soccer-related question, the agent system begins by de-\ncomposing the task into multiple sub-tasks executable by existing\ntools, and then invokes corresponding tools to process, capturing\nboth fine-grained player actions and macro-level team strategies\nfor comprehensive soccer analysis.\nTo summarize, we make the following contributions in this pa-\nper: (i) we construct SoccerWiki , the first large-scale multimodal\nknowledge base for soccer, integrating extensive information about\n9,471 players, 266 teams, 202 referees, and 235 venues, enabling\nknowledge-based question answering beyond simple visual percep-\ntion; (ii) we present SoccerBench , the largest and most compre-\nhensive soccer-specific benchmark through an automated curation\npipeline and manual verification, featuring around 10K standard-\nized multi-choice question-answering pairs across 13 distinct soccer\nunderstanding tasks; (iii) we develop SoccerAgent , a novel multi-\nagent system where specialized agent tools collaborate to integrate\ndomain knowledge and achieve robust performance for soccer video\nunderstanding; (iv) we conduct extensive evaluations against 11\nrepresentative MLLMs, demonstrating the challenging character-\nistics of SoccerBench and the superiority of our agentic system.\nWe believe these will establish a foundation for future research in\nevolving, knowledge-driven sports analytics.\n2 Related Works\n2.1 Question Answering in Vision\nQuestion Answering (QA) serves as a pivotal testbed for assessing\nthe comprehensive understanding capabilities of Multimodal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs). Early datasets like VQA [ 2] and COCO-\nCaption [ 4], primarily focus on narrow tasks ( e.g., object recognition\nor image captioning), while recent advancements [ 10,20,26,37,63,\n66] have significantly broadened the evaluation scope. MME [ 9]\nintegrates 14 perception/cognition tasks, and MMBench [ 36] im-\nproves robustness via ChatGPT-based answer alignment. MMMU [ 62]\nfurther advances by covering university-level problems across six\ndisciplines ( e.g., engineering, arts), demanding expert knowledge\nsynthesis from multimodal inputs.\n2.2 Sports Understanding\nSports understanding [ 51] is an emerging field that integrates\nmultiple data modalities across various disciplines, encompass-\ning diverse tasks such as automated scoring [ 45,59], action spot-\nting [ 6,7,13,16], foul recognition [ 21,22], commentary genera-\ntion [ 38,40,43,44], and tactical analysis [ 47,53,60].

In this paper, we\nfocus on soccer, the most popular sport worldwide, and construct\nthe largest and most comprehensive multimodal soccer-specific\nbenchmark to date, aiming to promote development in this field.\n2.3 Multi-Agent System\nMulti-Agent System (MAS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm\nfor modeling complex interactions among autonomous entities,\nwith applications across language model collaboration [ 18,31,61],\nembodied AI [ 19,49,54], and scientific problem-solving [ 8,12].\nRecent advances [ 23,46,52] highlight MAS\u2019s effectiveness in mul-\ntimodal reasoning tasks through role specialization and inter-agent\ncommunication. Frameworks like CAMEL [ 28], AutoGen [ 56], and\nChatDev [ 41] have further refined agent communication protocols\nfor complex task decomposition. This paper presents SoccerAgent ,\nthe first soccer-specific multi-agent system that decomposes compli-\ncated questions through collaborative reasoning and accomplishes\n13 distinct soccer understanding tasks.\n3 Dataset Construction\nThis section outlines the motivation and overview of our dataset in\nSection 3.1, followed by detailed descriptions of the data collection\nand curation processes in Section 3.2 and Section 3.3, respectively.\n3.1 Motivation & Overview\nSoccer is a dynamic and specialized domain, with its evolving nature\noften outpacing the static knowledge encoded within pre-trained\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs). To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce SoccerWiki , a dynamic, large-scale knowledge base that\nprovides up-to-date and comprehensive information on players,\nteams, referees, and venues. SoccerWiki spans data from the past\ndecade of the top five European Leagues, the UEFA Champions\nLeague, and the last three FIFA World Cups .While existing research in soccer AI primarily targets isolated\ntasks, it lacks a holistic framework for comprehensive evaluation.\nTo address this, we present SoccerBench , a multimodal benchmark\nfor soccer understanding. By integrating SoccerWiki with various\nexisting datasets [ 7,22,38,43,44] through an automated curation\npipeline, SoccerBench unifies 13 distinct soccer-specific analysis\ntasks into a standardized question-answering (QA) framework. It\nincludes approximately 10,000 QA pairs, enabling a robust and\ncomprehensive evaluation of soccer understanding models.\n3.2 Data Collection\nTo construct a diverse multimodal soccer-specific knowledge base,\nSoccerWiki , we aggregate comprehensive soccer-related informa-\ntion from Wikipedia1and Flashscore2,covering 9,471 players,\n266 teams, 202 referees, and 235 venues . Each entity in the\nknowledge base includes the corresponding image and detailed\nattributes, such as career statistics, personal profiles, team histories,\nand honors. Additionally, we have incorporated detailed game infor-\nmation from 1,988 soccer matches (from six major European soccer\nleagues and championships) in the SoccerReplay-1988 dataset, cov-\nering team lineups, key event annotations, and detailed captions.\nTo further improve data coverage, we have manually annotated the\njersey colors for both home and away teams of these matches.\nTo formulate a soccer-specific multimodal benchmark, namely,\nSoccerBench , under an unified question-answering framework, we\nleverage extensive data from SoccerWiki and annotations from vari-\nous existing soccer datasets, including: (i) textual commentary from\nSoccerReplay-1988 [ 43] and SoccerNet-Caption [ 38], (ii) event labels\nfrom SoccerReplay-1988 [ 43], SoccerNet-v2 [ 7] and SoccerNet-test-\nalign [ 44], (iii) foul classification labels from SoccerNet-XFoul [ 22],\n(iv) jersey number labels from SoccerNet-JN [ 5], (v) camera sta-\ntus and replay labels from SoccerNet-v2 [ 7]. The comprehensive\nintegration of these diverse data sources and tasks ensures the ex-\nceptional coverage and challenging characteristics of SoccerBench.\n1www.wikipedia.org\n2www.flashscore.com\n3\n\nTechnical Report, 2025 Jiayuan Rao, Zifeng Li, Haoning Wu, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang, and Weidi Xie\nGame Covered:Entity Covered:Modality Covered:9,471Players\n202 Referees266 Teams2,488 Games235 VenuesWiki PageGameDataPlayer Photos\nSoccerWikiSoccerReplay-1988SoccerNet-JerseySoccerNet-V2\nSoccerNet-XFoulSoccerNet-CaptionExisting Datasets\nLLM Generate QATemplate Generate QAManualQualityCheck\nMulti-choiceQA Conversion\nBackground Knowledge Text QA\u201cHow many games did Dominik Schmid play for FC Basel in total?

We construct multi-choice QA samples based on SoccerWiki and other existing\ndatasets Some representative examples for each task are presented for reference.\n3.3 Data Curation\n3.3.1 Open-ended QA Construction. As depicted in Table 1, we\ncategorize the extensive data collection into 13 subtasks based on\ntheir annotations, and construct open-ended QA pairs by employing\npredefined templates or prompting LLMs like DeepSeek-v3 [ 32]. For\nquestions in a relatively uniform and fixed question pattern, such\nas \u201cWhat type of event is happening in this video?\u201d, which can be\nhandled by visual perceptions, we design questions via predefined\ntemplates according to the annotations from existing benchmarks.\nAnd for tasks requiring soccer-specific knowledge or factual data,\ne.g., \u201cHow many teams did the player in the image play for during\nhis career?\u201d, we adopt LLMs to create QA pairs with appropriate\nprompts, which will be detailed in Section C of Appendix .\n3.3.2 Conversion from Open-ended QA to Multi-choice QA. To fa-\ncilitate efficient quantitative evaluation, we convert open-ended\nQA pairs into multi-choice format, each with one correct answer\nand three carefully designed distractors. Concretely, we employtwo strategies to construct plausible yet challenging distractors:\n(i) randomly sample labels from the same category as the correct\nanswer ( e.g., action, camera, and foul classification); and (ii) prompt\nDeepSeek-v3 [ 32] to create distractors that may introduce confu-\nsion ( e.g., numbers, dates, and team names). These strategies en-\nsure the complexity and perplexity of our challenging benchmark.\nThrough this scalable curation pipeline, we start by automatically\nsynthesizing 100K QA pairs, then manually select around 10K rep-\nresentative samples to form SoccerBench .\n3.3.3 Discussion. As depicted in Table 1, SoccerBench covers 13\ndistinct soccer-specific QA tasks with a balanced distribution. Some\nrepresentative examples of each task are presented in Figure 2,\nshowcasing the diverse formats and content across various tasks.\nAmong them, tasks (Q1)-(Q2) are text-based QA, (Q3)-(Q6) involve\nimage-related QA, and (Q7)-(Q13) focus on video-related QA. To the\nbest of our knowledge, SoccerBench represents the largest and most\n4\n\nMulti-Agent System for Comprehensive Soccer Understanding Technical Report, 2025\ncomprehensive multimodal soccer-specific benchmark to date, cov-\nering diverse complexity levels, modalities, and task categories. We\nbelieve it will serve as a valuable resource for soccer understanding\nevaluation, thus advancing research in sports analysis.\n4 Methodology\nWe introduce SoccerAgent , a multi-agent system, that leverages\na modular architecture for comprehensive analysis and precise re-\nsponses to multimodal soccer-related questions, addressing diverse\nand knowledge-intensive tasks in soccer understanding. In this\nsection, we begin by formulating the problem and defining the\nscope of soccer-related question-answering in Section 4.1; Next, we\ndetail the specialized tools integrated into the system in Section 4.2;\nFinally, in Section 4.3, we elaborate on the architecture, operational\nlogic, and interaction mechanisms that enable SoccerAgent to de-\nliver accurate and robust solutions.\n4.1 Problem Formulation\nAs outlined in Section 3, soccer understanding tasks span a wide\nrange of challenges, requiring nuanced reasoning across both visual\nand contextual knowledge domains. To tackle these complexities,\nour framework leverages a multi-agent collaborative system in-\ntegrated with existing tools and models , ensuring adaptability,\nscalability, and transparency. The core process of our framework\ncan be formally expressed as:\nr=A(q;T)\nHere,Adenotes our multi-agent system, SoccerAgent , which con-\nsists of two primary components: A\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b is responsible for planning\nand determining the optimal chain of tools required to address the\ninput question,A\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50 executes the planned tool chain, ensuring\nthe seamless integration of outputs from individual tools.\nThe input question ( q) represents a specific multimodal soccer-\nrelated question, while Trefers to a dynamically configurable\ntoolbox, expressed as T={t1,t2, . . . , t\ud835\udc5b}, where each t\ud835\udc56represents\na distinct tool. Each tool ( t) performs a specific task based on the\ninput instruction ( s) and produces an execution output \ud835\udf0f=t(s).\nFinally, the system produces a comprehensive response ( r) by ag-\ngregating and reasoning over the outputs. Note that, the tools can\nbe any existing APIs or models, and in this paper, open-source\nframeworks are prioritized for our toolbox wherever feasible.\n4.2 Tools\nOur toolbox integrates 18 specialized tools, each designed to handle\nspecific functionalities across diverse modalities. These tools are\nrigorously defined with clear input/output specifications to guide\nthe decision-making and operation processes of SoccerAgent . As\ndepicted in Figure 3, the toolbox consists of 12 soccer-specific tools\nand 6 general-purpose tools, systematically categorized as follows.\n4.2.1 Off-the-shelf Soccer-specific Tools. We adopt two tools from\nthe pre-trained soccer understanding model proposed in UniSoc-\ncer [43]: (i) Action Classifier : automatically classifies actions, and (ii)\nCommentary Generation : produces anonymized textual descriptions\nof video content. These tools operate directly on soccer video data,\nproviding foundational capabilities for soccer-specific analysis.4.2.2 Soccer-specific Retrieval Tools. Leveraging information in\nSoccerWiki, we develop four retrieval tools: (i) Match Search: re-\ntrieves relevant match records from SoccerWiki based on textual\nqueries; (ii) Match History Retrieval: extracts and summarizes event\nstatistics from identified matches; (iii) Match Info Retrieval: fetches\nextra match details, such as referee name and line-up formations;\nand (iv) Face Recognition: identifies players by matching input im-\nages with facial photos in SoccerWiki. The first three tools are imple-\nmented by DeepSeek-v3 [ 32] with customized prompts , while the\nlast tool adopts an open-source face recognition framework [11].\n4.2.3 Soccer-specific Image Understanding Tools. Based on Qwen2.5-\nVL-7B [ 3] with carefully crafted prompts (detailed in the Supple-\nmentary Material ), we develop three soccer-specific image un-\nderstanding tools: (i) Camera Detection: serves as a classifier to\nrecognize camera position types; (ii) Jersey Number Recognition:\nfirst checks if the image contains jersey numbers via a pretrained\nmodel [ 25] and then extracts them; and (iii) Score/Time Recognition:\ncaptures the scoreboard and game time from broadcast images.\n4.2.4 Soccer-specific Video Understanding Tools. Similarly, Qwen2.5-\nVL-7B [ 3] also serves as the backbone for video understanding tools,\nincluding: (i) Replay Grounding: analyzes football replay clips and\nverifies their consistency with live broadcast footage; (ii) Jersey\nColor Recognition: concentrates on recognizing the jersey color of\nplayers in the given footage and answers relevant questions; and\n(iii)Foul Recognition: functions as a multi-view video referee system,\naggregating inputs from different camera angles through a voting\nmechanism to determine final decisions.\n4.2.5 General-purpose Multimodal Parsing Tools. To support generic\nmultimodal and logical operations, we implement six general-purpose\ntools: (i) Frame Selection: adopts CLIP [ 42] text-to-image similarity\nto extract the video frame most semantically aligned with a given\ntextual prompt, effectively converting video content into keyframes;\n(ii)Segment: leverages off-the-shelf GroundingDINO [ 35] to detect\nand localize relevant entities in images with precise bounding boxes\ncorresponding to given text prompts. (iii) Textual Entity Search: ex-\ntracts potential key entities (players, teams, referees, etc.) from\ninput questions for subsequent processing by subsequent tool pro-\ncessing; (iv) Textual Retrieval: fetches relevant information from\nlong-form text based on specific query prompts; (v) Answer Selection\nis specifically designed for multiple-choice scenarios, returning the\nmost probable answer; and (vi) a general LLM Tool: serves as a de-\nfault module for arbitrary language model operations when needed.\nHere, the last four tools are implemented with DeepSeek-v3 [ 32],\nenabling efficient text-based information extraction and expansion.\n4.3 SoccerAgent\n4.3.1 Tool Chain Planning. As illustrated in Figure 3, tool chain\nplanning is the initial step upon receiving a soccer-related question.\nGiven a specific question ( q), the planning agent ( A\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b) systemati-\ncally constructs an optimal tool chain ( C), comprising \ud835\udc5atools. This\nis achieved through reasoning about the question\u2019s requirements\nand the capabilities of the tools available in the toolbox. The process\ncan be formally expressed as:\nC=A\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b(q,T)=[t\ud835\udc56\u2192t\ud835\udc57\u2192\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u2192 t\ud835\udc5a]\n5\n\nTechnical Report, 2025 Jiayuan Rao, Zifeng Li, Haoning Wu, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang, and Weidi Xie\nOutputResponseToolboxQuestionInput\nCommentaryGeneration\nTextualRetrieval\nMatchSearchStep 1: Plan Tool Chain by \ud835\udcd0\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc8f\u201cWhen did the substitute player with darkbrownhair in this video make his debut for the national team?\u201dStep 2: Execute Tools by \ud835\udcd0\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc84\nWiki EntitySearch\nI need to select a frame showing the substitute player with dark brown hair.\nUse the selected picture, recognize this player from SoccerWiki and tell me who he is.\nAfter searching in the face dataset, we foundthemost similar person is Cedric Itten (with 78.93% similarity), or Marco Reus (with 12.05% similarity).The95thframe can best match the prompt \u201cthe substitute player with dark brown hair\u201d.

We design a multi-agent system to decompose and solve the given multi-modal\nsoccer-related questions step by step with a distributed toolbox.\nHere, Crepresents the ordered sequence of tools required to address\nthe input question ( q), andTdenotes the set of tools described in\nSection 4.2. The planned chain ensures that each tool contributes\nmeaningfully to solving the task while adhering to the input/output\ncompatibility between consecutive tools.\n4.3.2 Iterative Tool Execution. Once the tool chain is planned, the\nexecution agent (A\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50) processes the chain iteratively, considering\nthe original soccer question ( q) and the accumulated execution his-\ntory. Each step in the execution process is history-aware, enabling\nthe agent to adaptively determine appropriate inputs for each tool.\nAt the \ud835\udc56-th step, the process involves generating the instruction\ninput ( s\ud835\udc56) based on the question ( q) and the accumulated execution\nhistory (H\ud835\udc56), which is defined as:\nH\ud835\udc56={(t1,s1, \ud835\udf0f1),\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,(t\ud835\udc56\u22121,s\ud835\udc56\u22121, \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc56\u22121)},withH0=\u2205The instruction input ( s\ud835\udc56) and the tool ( t\ud835\udc56) are then used to compute\nthe output ( \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc56) as follows:\n\ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc56=t\ud835\udc56(s\ud835\udc56),s\ud835\udc56=A\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50(q,H\ud835\udc56\u22121;t\ud835\udc56)\nTo ensure consistency and interpretability, each instruction gen-\nerated byA\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50 adheres to a strictly structured format, encapsu-\nlated within <Call></Call> markers, with four specialized delim-\niters specifying key execution parameters: <Tool></Tool> denotes\nthe name of the invoked tool; <Query></Query> contains the text\ninput for the tool; <Material></Material> provides the file paths\nof the input visual content; <Purpose></Purpose> articulates the\nrationale and objective for executing the tool at this step.\nUpon reaching the final execution step, A\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50 makes the last\nexecution in <EndCall></EndCall> markers, the output generated\nby this terminal step, \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc5a, is returned as the system\u2019s ultimate re-\nsponse ( r).

We compare our SoccerAgent against several\nstate-of-the-art multimodal large language models on SoccerBench ,\nincluding commercial APIs ( e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet [ 1], GPT-4o [ 39],\nGemini 2.0 Flash [ 14],etc.) and publicly available open-source mod-\nels (including DeepSeek-v3 [ 32], DeepSeek-R1 [ 17], Qwen2.5-VL [ 3],\nLLaVA-onevision [ 27], VideoLLaMA3 [ 64], LLaVA-Video [ 65], and\nVideoChat [ 30]). Wherever feasible, open-source frameworks are\nprioritized for our toolbox, as detailed in Section 4.2.\n5.1.2 Evaluation Metrics. In all experiments, we compare the per-\nformance on multi-choice QA pairs in SoccerBench, and use the\nanswer accuracy as the evaluation metric. We report both task-\nspecific accuracy and category-specific (TextQA, ImageQA, and\nVideoQA) accuracy, to comprehensively reflect model performance.\n5.1.3 Implementation Details. All pipelines in Table 2 receive both\nquestions and their corresponding multi-choice options as input\ncontext, while in Table 3, our proposed first generates open-ended\nanswers and then maps them to the provided multi-choice options\nviaChoice Selection Tool for standardized scoring.5.2 Quantitative Results\nAccording to the results presented in Table 2, we have the fol-\nlowing observations of our SoccerBench: (i) The benchmark effec-\ntively differentiates the soccer understanding capabilities of exist-\ning MLLMs, with accuracy ranges spanning TextQA (39.6\u201361.6%),\nImageQA (47.1\u201362.3%), and VideoQA (30.3\u201357.5%). This variation\nreflects the diverse and challenging nature of SoccerBench, as well\nas the varying levels of soccer-specific knowledge among existing\nmodels; (ii) Distinct models excel in specific QA tasks ( e.g., GPT-4o\nachieves significantly higher performance in Q3- Camera Status\nClassification , Q5- Jersey Number Recognition and Q13- Multi-view\nFoul Recognition , while Gemini 2.0 Flash substantially outperforms\nin Q8- Replay Grounding and Q12- Jersey Color Relevant QA ), high-\nlighting their specialization in soccer understanding tasks. More\nresults could be found in Section B of Appendix ; and (iii) Most\nmodels perform well on tasks requiring less domain knowledge ( e.g.,\nQ5-Jersey Number Recognition and Q7- Camera Status Switching ), but\nstill struggle with other tasks demanding in-depth soccer-specific\nknowledge. This indicates that current models are still not capable\nof fully handling comprehensive soccer understanding tasks.\nIn contrast to the above baselines, SoccerAgent first generates\nopen-ended responses to the questions and subsequently selects\nfrom multiple choices, as detailed in Section 5.1.3, crucially without\naccess to the question options during reasoning and tool execu-\ntion. Despite this constraint, SoccerAgent still outperforms with\nthe following characteristics: (i) superior performance on ques-\ntions requiring soccer-specific knowledge ( e.g., Q1/4- Background\nKnowledge Text/Image QA and Q9- Action Classification ); and (ii)\nleading results in TextQA and VideoQA compared to all baselines,\neven without multi-choice context, while achieving competitive\nImageQA performance comparable to commercial-use models.\n7\n\nTechnical Report, 2025 Jiayuan Rao, Zifeng Li, Haoning Wu, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang, and Weidi Xie\nTable 3: Ablations on SoccerAgent.

Here, we demonstrate several representative examples showing the entire process of tool planning\nand tool execution of different soccer understanding tasks.\n5.3 Ablation Studies\nTo systematically evaluate the intrinsic soccer understanding ca-\npabilities without possible answers, we conduct ablation studies\non several variants of SoccerAgent. Concretely, we consider: (i)\nwhether to provide the planning agent ( A\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b) with task descrip-\ntions, including taxonomic definitions of all 13 question types and\nrecommended tool chains; and (ii) whether to supply the execu-\ntion agent (A\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50) with 20 fully annotated execution examples\ndemonstrating the optimal tool execution process. These quantita-\ntively assess the autonomous soccer reasoning capacities of both\ncomponents in SoccerAgent.\nAs illustrated in Table 3, variations in task descriptions and\nexecution examples have minimal impact on overall accuracy, in-\ndicating that SoccerAgent inherently achieves stable performance\nin both problem decomposition and tool execution. However, sev-\neral noteworthy observations emerge: (i) The incorporation of text\ndescriptions leads to accuracy improvements across most question\ntypes, suggesting that better task explanations can further boostthe reasoning and decomposition abilities of SoccerAgent, espe-\ncially, the planning agent ( A\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b); and (ii) While the extra execu-\ntion examples offer a notable performance gain (+3.6%) in TextQA\ntasks, it conversely results in marginal declines for ImageQA (-\n0.4%) and VideoQA (-1.1%). This indicates that the execution mod-\nule (A\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50) is inherently adept at processing visual information\neffectively, whereas additional few-shot examples may introduce\ncounterproductive effects. Thus, we choose to provide detailed task\ndescriptions for SoccerAgent without introducing extra execution\nexamples, as the default configuration.\n5.4 Qualitative Results\nAs presented in Figure 4, we illustrate the complete operation\nprocess of SoccerAgent through representative qualitative results,\nacross TextQA, ImageQA, and VideoQA, which highlights its reason-\ning logic, multimodal processing, and tool execution. Most cases\ndemonstrate seamless integration of tools, with the framework\neffectively decomposing and resolving soccer-related questions.\n8\n\nMulti-Agent System for Comprehensive Soccer Understanding Technical Report, 2025\nHowever, execution errors occur occasionally, such as in the third\nexample, where the Face Recognition tool is mistakenly invoked\nfor the video input due to flawed tool chain planning. In response,\nA\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50 autonomously adjusts its strategy, adopting the Game Search\ntool to retrieve the mentioned game. This showcases SoccerAgent\u2019s\nerror-correction capability, advanced tool functionalities compre-\nhension, and domain-specific expertise in soccer understanding.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for holis-\ntic soccer understanding. Specifically, we introduce SoccerWiki ,\nthe first large-scale multimodal knowledge base integrating rich\nsoccer-specific domain knowledge. Leveraging SoccerWiki and var-\nious existing data sources, we present SoccerBench , the most\ncomprehensive soccer benchmark to date, featuring around 10K\nstandardized QA pairs across 13 soccer understanding tasks. To\ntackle this challenging and knowledge-intensive task, we establish\nSoccerAgent , a novel multi-agent system that achieves robust per-\nformance through collaborative reasoning and domain expertise.\nExtensive evaluations and ablations have demonstrated the superi-\nority of our framework over existing MLLMs, establishing a new\nfoundation for knowledge-driven sports analytics.\nAcknowledgments\nWeidi would like to acknowledge the funding from Scientific Re-\nsearch Innovation Capability Support Project for Young Faculty (ZY-\nGXQNJSKYCXNLZCXM-I22).\nReferences\n[1]Anthropic. 2025.

As illustrated in Table 4, we systematically compare the task coverage of current soccer-related\nbenchmarks, highlighting both the breadth of our approach and gaps in prior work. This comprehensive benchmark enables cross-task\nevaluation while addressing the need for standardized assessment in soccer AI research.\nTable 4: Comparison of the task coverage of our SoccerBench against other soccer-related datasets.\nDataset BackGround Match Information Camera Status Jersey Number Jersey Color Replay Grounding Action Classification Commentary Foul Recognition\nSoccerNet-v1 [13] \u2718 \u2714 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718\nSoccerNet-v2 [7] \u2718 \u2714 \u2714 \u2718 \u2718 \u2714 \u2714 \u2718 \u2718\nSoccerNet-Caption [38] \u2718 \u2714 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2714 \u2718\nSoccerNet-JN [5] \u2718 \u2718 \u2714 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718\nGOAL [40] \u2718 \u2714 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2714 \u2718\nSoccerNet-XFoul[22] \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2714\nSoccerReplay-1988[43] \u2718 \u2714 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2714 \u2714 \u2718\nSoccerBench(Ours) \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714 \u2714\nTable 5 shows a comparison between SoccerBench and other sports QA datasets.

[ 15] on SoccerBench, with the results presented in Table 6. Due to budget limitations, we test all\nTextQA and ImageQA tasks but restrict VideoQA evaluation to a subset of 100 QA pairs per task. The findings demonstrate that Gemini 2.5\nPro Exp. achieves strong performance across multiple tasks in SoccerBench, indicating its robust capability in soccer-related understanding.\nTable 6: Quantitative Results for Gemini 2.5 Pro on SoccerBench. Considering the cost, we randomly select 100 QAs as a subset\nfor evaluation of the corresponding task.\nModelTextQA ImageQA VideoQA Overall\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q8 Q9 Q10 Q11 Q12 Q13 Text Image Video\nGemini 2.5 Pro [15] 77.5 71.0 70.9 64.0 89.5 83.8 68.0* 94.0* 69.0* 71.0* 61.0* 48.0* 58.0* 74.6 73.0 66.2*\n12\n\nMulti-Agent System for Comprehensive Soccer Understanding Technical Report, 2025\nC Further Implementation Details\nC.1 Details in Open-ended QA Construction\nAs mentioned before, we derive specialized methods to generate open-ended soccer questions with three methods: (i) LLM Generation\nwith DeepSeek-V3 [ 32]; (ii) Template applications; and (iii) Both LLM and Template. For each task in SoccerBench, we decide the question\ngeneration method considering the form and characteristics of SoccerWiki or other source datasets. Notably, for both textual commentary\nand event labels, we utilize only the test sets from the respective datasets to avoid potential data leakage to the trained models used later.\nThe detailed introduction is listed as follows:\nC.1.1 Background Knowledge Text QA. With the textual information from wiki pages of all the players, teams, referees, and venues, we use\nDeepSeek-V3 [ 32] to generate questions from the entire page. The generated question should be equipped with its answer and the reference\nposition in the wiki page to ensure the rationality of the generated questions.\nC.1.2 Match Situation QA. Similar to Background Knowledge Text QA , we use the same method to generate questions from the existing\nsoccer datasets, MatchTime [ 43] and SoccerReplay-1988 [ 44]. With .json game files as input, LLM would generate questions about the\ngame events and relevant information.\nC.1.3 Camera Status Classification. We use the 13 categories of camera status annotations in SoccerNet-v2 [ 7] to capture the corresponding\nimages in the match video. Then we use templates such as \u201cWhat is the camera position in this picture?\u201d to directly ask the camera status to\nconstruct QA.\nC.1.4 Background Knowledge Image QA. Based on Background Knowledge Text QA , we first find the picture corresponding to the player\u2019s\nname in the question in SoccerWiki, and then use the pronoun \u201cthis player\u201d to replace the name in the question to complete this construction.\nC.1.5 Jersey Number Recognition. We utilize the player images and corresponding jersey number ground truth annotations in SoccerNet-\nJN [5], using templates like \u201cWhat is the number on the player\u2019s jersey in this image?\u201d to directly ask the jersey number in the image.\nC.1.6 Score and Time Relevant QA. Basically, this task provides a screenshot image of a soccer broadcast with time and scoreboard shown\ninside. With this digital information, 2 different types of questions could be generated: (i) Time and Score Recognition : For any second of a soccer\ngame, the game time and scores could be reached from soccer commentary datasets, MatchTime [ 43] and SoccerReplay-1988 [ 44]. We derive\na template to generate such questions and make screenshots from according games with corresponding time stamps. (ii) Retrieval Required\nQuestions: With game time and game events available, we introduce the basic game information until this game time to DeepSeek-V3 [ 32]\nand let it generate the questions corresponding to game time and game information.\nC.1.7 Camera Status Switching. Similar to Camera Status Classification , we use the camera status annotations in SoccerNet-v2 [ 7] and cut a\nvideo clip before and after the camera switch. Directly ask the switch type by templates like \u201cWhat kind of camera transitions are used in the\nvideo?\u201d to construct QA.\nC.1.8 Replay Grounding. Using the replay annotations from SoccerNet-v2 [ 7], we first extract replay video clips based on the provided\ntimestamps. Next, we use the link annotations to extract the action video clips corresponding to each replay, thereby constructing a\nreplay-action relationship pair. Then we use templates like \"The first video clip is a replay. From the remaining clips, please choose which\none is being replayed.\" to construct QA.\nC.1.9 Action Classification. With plenty of event labels in MatchTime [ 43] and SoccerReplay-1988 [ 44], we set some templates to generate\nquestions requiring the event label in the video clips.\nC.1.10 Commentary Generation. As for Commentary Generation , the methodology is the same as Action Classification .\nC.1.11 Commentary Relevant QA. We could capture the player name from non-anonymized commentaries in MatchTime [ 43] and\nSoccerReplay-1988 [ 44], then we send the player name and his generated questions in Background Knowledge Text QA to DeepSeek-\nV3 [32] to generate the question combining the commentaries about the player himself. Such questions could share the same answer as\nquestions in Background Knowledge Text QA .\nC.1.12 Jersey Color Relevant QA. With our manually labeled jersey colors of both teams for all the games in MatchTime [ 43] and SoccerReplay-\n1988 [44]. DeepSeek-V3 [32] helps generate questions combining the information of jersey color and commentaries.\nC.1.13 Multi-view Foul Recognition. As SoccerNet-XFouls [ 21] has labelled different dimensions of soccer fouls with multi-view foul video\nclips. We directly use its template and options to generate questions on specific dimensions ( e.g., handball, foul class, etc.)\n13\n\nTechnical Report, 2025 Jiayuan Rao, Zifeng Li, Haoning Wu, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang, and Weidi Xie\nC.2 Task Description Prompt (with recommended chains)\nTask1: **Background knowledge text QA** is a task that asks questions about the basic information of a specific players, referee,\nteam and venues.

In this work, we\nexamine the LHC sensitivity to weak gauginos in light of the latest constraints from the\nmuon g\u22122 anomaly and dark matter (DM) observations. To simultaneously account for\nthe observed 5 \u03c3deviation in muon g\u22122 and the correct DM relic abundance, the DM\ncandidate in the MSSM must be bino-like: wino- or higgsino-like neutralinos require TeV-\nscale masses to avoid underabundance, rendering the electroweakino spectrum too heavy\nto yield a sizable g\u22122 contribution. Moreover, tight direct detection limits disfavor light\nhiggsinos, which can induce sizable DM\u2013nucleon scattering via bino\u2013higgsino mixing. We\nthus focus on scenarios with a bino-like LSP and relatively heavy higgsinos. Two classes of\nwino spectra are considered: a light-wino scenario (LWo) with m\u02dcW\u22721 TeV, and a heavy-\nwino scenario (HWo) with m\u02dcW\u22731 TeV. For each, we delineate the viable parameter space\nunder current constraints and assess the discovery potential at future LHC stages. We\nfind that while the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) can probe a portion of the parameter\nspace, the high-energy 27 TeV LHC (HE-LHC) is capable of covering most of it.\nArXiv ePrint: xxxx.xxxxarXiv:2505.03722v1  [hep-ph]  6 May 2025\n\nContents\n1 Introduction 1\n2 Overview of the MSSM framework 2\n3 Constraining the MSSM with muon g\u20132and dark matter data 4\n4 Probing weak gauginos at the HL-LHC and HE-LHC 9\n5 Conclusions 14\n1 Introduction\nThe longstanding discrepancy in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, a\u00b5\u2261\n(g\u22122)\u00b5/2, has been further solidified by the 2021 result of the Fermilab Muon g\u22122\nCollaboration [1], confirming the earlier E821 measurement at Brookhaven [2]. With the\nlatest theoretical and experimental updates [3\u20136], the combined analysis now shows a 5 .2\u03c3\ndeviation:\n\u2206a\u00b5=aexp\n\u00b5\u2212aSM\n\u00b5= (2.49\u00b10.48)\u00d710\u22129, (1.1)\ncorresponding to a relative precision of 0.20 parts per million (ppm), and representing one\nof the most statistically significant hints of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) to\ndate.\nIn parallel, astrophysical and cosmological observations have firmly established the\npresence of non-luminous, non-baryonic dark matter (DM), accounting for about 27% of\nthe universe\u2019s energy budget. Identifying its particle nature remains a fundamental open\nquestion in particle physics and cosmology. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs),\nthermally produced in the early universe, provide a compelling candidate class. These\nmodels naturally reproduce the observed relic density via the freeze-out mechanism, and\nhave been extensively tested through direct, indirect, and collider-based searches [7\u201319].\nReconciling the muon g\u20132 anomaly with the observed dark matter relic abundance\nand the null results from LHC supersymmetry searches presents a complex and highly con-\nstrained challenge for the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) [20\u201328]. To\naccommodate the g\u20132 discrepancy, the spectrum must feature relatively light electroweaki-\nnos and sleptons, especially charginos and neutralinos with wino or higgsino components,\nand left-handed smuons or muon sneutrinos [29\u201355]. These states generate sizable loop\ncontributions to \u2206 a\u00b5, potentially accounting for the observed deviation. On the other\nhand, satisfying the relic density and direct detection bounds typically requires a bino-like\nneutralino as the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), with minimal higgsino or wino\nadmixture. A nearly pure bino, however, annihilates too inefficiently in the early universe,\n\u2013 1 \u2013\n\noften resulting in overabundant dark matter unless supplemented by efficient depletion\nchannels such as coannihilation. Achieving such coannihilation typically demands com-\npressed spectra and fine-tuned mass splittings, especially when involving winos or sleptons.\nIn addition, current LHC searches place stringent lower bounds on the masses of charginos\nand sleptons, particularly in the presence of light bino-like LSPs with sizable production\ncross sections. These competing requirements introduce significant tension into the viable\nMSSM parameter space and motivate a detailed investigation of the interplay between\nthem.\nIn this work, we investigate the LHC sensitivity to weak gauginos in the MSSM, taking\ninto account the latest constraints from the muon g\u20132 anomaly and dark matter observa-\ntions. We focus on two well-motivated classes of scenarios that can potentially satisfy\nall current experimental bounds: one in which a bino-like neutralino coannihilates with a\nslightly heavier wino, and another involving coannihilation with nearly mass-degenerate\nsleptons. These configurations are systematically explored through dedicated scans of the\nMSSM parameter space, identifying viable regions that reconcile the muon g\u20132 discrep-\nancy, the observed dark matter relic abundance, and null results from direct detection\nand collider experiments. Although related scenarios have been studied previously [56\u201362],\nmany analyses either neglected the requirement of thermal relic matching, focused only\non current LHC bounds, or did not consider the potential reach of future LHC upgrades.\nWe go beyond previous work by evaluating the prospects for probing these scenarios at\nboth the High Luminosity (HL-) and High Energy (HE-) phases of the LHC, highlight-\ning characteristic spectra and providing benchmark points to inform experimental search\nstrategies.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. In Sec. 2, we briefly review the status of the\nmuon g\u20132 anomaly and dark matter in the context of the MSSM, highlighting the relevant\nmechanisms that can simultaneously address both phenomena. In Sec. 3, we describe the\nparameter scan strategy and discuss the experimental constraints used to identify viable\nMSSM scenarios. In Sec. 4, we analyze the LHC sensitivity to weak gauginos in the HL-\nLHC and HE-LHC phases, focusing on the discovery potential of the benchmark scenarios.\nFinally, we summarize our findings in Sec. 5.\n2 Overview of the MSSM framework\nIn the MSSM, there are four neutralinos, denoted by \u02dc \u03c70\n1,2,3,4in ascending order of mass.\nThese states are formed from linear combinations of the bino ( \u02dcB), wino ( \u02dcW0), and the\nneutral higgsinos ( \u02dcH0\nu,\u02dcH0\nd). Their masses and mixings are governed by the neutralino\nmass matrix, which can be written as [20]:\nM\u02dc\u03c70=\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8edM1 0 \u2212c\u03b2sWmZs\u03b2sWmZ\n0 M2 c\u03b2cWmZ\u2212s\u03b2cWmZ\n\u2212c\u03b2sWmZc\u03b2cWmZ 0 \u2212\u00b5\ns\u03b2sWmZ\u2212s\u03b2cWmZ\u2212\u00b5 0\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8(2.1)\n\u2013 2 \u2013\n\nHere, s\u03b2,c\u03b2,sW, and cWrepresent sin \u03b2, cos \u03b2, sin\u03b8W, and cos \u03b8W, respectively. The\nparameters M1andM2denote the soft SUSY-breaking mass terms for the bino and wino,\nrespectively, while \u00b5is the higgsino mass parameter. The mass matrix is diagonalized by\na unitary 4 \u00d74 matrix N.\nSimilarly, the chargino mass matrix, arising from the mixing of the charged wino ( \u02dcW\u00b1)\nand the charged higgsinos ( \u02dcH\u2212\nd,\u02dcH+\nu), is given by:\nM\u02dc\u03c7\u00b1= \nM2\u221a\n2s\u03b2mW\u221a\n2c\u03b2mW \u00b5!\n(2.2)\nThis matrix can be diagonalized by two unitary 2 \u00d72 matrices, UandV.\nThe dominant supersymmetric contributions to the muon g\u22122 originate from one-loop\ndiagrams involving neutralino\u2013smuon (\u02dc \u03c70\u2013\u02dc\u00b5) and chargino\u2013sneutrino (\u02dc \u03c7\u00b1\u2013\u02dc\u03bd) exchanges, as\nillustrated in Fig. 1.

One-loop diagrams contributing to the SUSY corrections to a\u00b5.\nwhere y\u00b5=g2m\u00b5\u221a\n2mWcos\u03b2denotes the muon Yukawa coupling.\nAssuming a common mass scale MSUSY for all supersymmetric particles, the contribu-\ntions from the \u02dc \u03c70\u2013\u02dc\u00b5and \u02dc\u03c7\u00b1\u2013\u02dc\u03bdloops can be approximated as follows [29]:\n\u03b4a\u02dc\u03c70\u02dc\u00b5\n\u00b5=1\n192\u03c02m2\n\u00b5\nM2\nSUSY(g2\n1\u2212g2\n2) tan\u03b2 , (2.9)\n\u03b4a\u02dc\u03c7\u00b1\u02dc\u00b5\n\u00b5=1\n32\u03c02m2\n\u00b5\nM2\nSUSYg2\n2tan\u03b2 , (2.10)\nand the corresponding SUSY contributions to a\u00b5are approximately given by:\n\u03b4aSUSY\n\u00b5 = 14 tan \u03b2\u0012100 GeV\nMSUSY\u00132\n10\u221210. (2.11)\nFrom the above expression, it is evident that the dominant contribution arises from the\n\u02dc\u03c7\u00b1\u2013\u02dc\u03bdloops. The SUSY contribution is enhanced by a larger value of tan \u03b2, whereas it is\nsuppressed by the overall mass scale of the superpartners. Therefore, to achieve a sizable\neffect on the muon g\u20132, the masses of the relevant charginos, neutralinos, and sleptons\nmust remain sufficiently light.\nIn this work, we require the first neutralino \u02dc \u03c70\n1to be the lightest SUSY particle (LSP),\nwhich serves as the DM candidate. We assume the lightest neutralino \u02dc \u03c70\n1to be the lightest\nsupersymmetric particle (LSP), thereby serving as the dark matter candidate. When \u02dc \u03c70\n1\nis wino-like or higgsino-like, its (co-)annihilation rate in the early universe is typically\ntoo efficient to yield the observed relic abundance. To match the correct dark matter\ndensity without invoking additional non-SUSY components such as axions, such candidates\nwould need to have masses at the TeV scale [63, 64]. However, this scenario results in an\nelectroweakino spectrum that is too heavy to account for the observed muon g\u20132 anomaly.\nFurthermore, wino- or higgsino-like neutralinos generally exhibit sizable scattering cross-\nsections with nucleons, making them strongly constrained by current direct detection limits.\n3 Constraining the MSSM with muon g\u20132and dark matter data\nWe investigate two well-motivated scenarios within the MSSM: the light-wino scenario\n(LWo) and the heavy-wino scenario (HWo), which are distinguished by the mass hierarchy\n\u2013 4 \u2013\n\nbetween the wino and bino. To explore the viable parameter space consistent with current\nexperimental results, we perform comprehensive numerical scans using a suite of established\ncomputational tools.\nWe generate the SUSY mass spectrum using the SUSY-HIT package [65], with the\nspectrum calculation handled by the SuSpect-2.41 subroutine [66]. Higgs boson decays\nand SUSY particle decays are computed with HDECAY-3.4 [67, 68] and SDECAY-1.5 [69],\nrespectively. The dark matter relic density of the lightest neutralino is evaluated using\nMicrOMEGAs-5.3.41 [70], while the two-loop SUSY contributions to the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment are computed via GM2Calc-2.2.0 [32, 71]. Finally, collider constraints\nfrom existing LHC searches are implemented using the SModelS-3.0.0 framework [72\u2013\n76], which decomposes the SUSY spectrum into simplified topologies and compares them\nagainst the latest experimental bounds.\nThe parameter ranges used in our scan are defined as follows. For the light-wino\nscenario (LWo), we take\n0 TeV \u2264M1\u2243M2\u22641 TeV ,3 TeV \u2264\u00b5\u22645 TeV , (3.1)\nwhile for the heavy-wino scenario (HWo), we consider\n0 TeV \u2264M1\u22641 TeV ,1 TeV \u2264M2\u22645 TeV ,3 TeV \u2264\u00b5\u22645 TeV . (3.2)\nHere, M1,M2, and \u00b5denote the soft mass parameters of the bino, wino, and higgsino,\nrespectively. For the HWo scenario, we further impose M2\u2264\u00b5to ensure that the second-\nlightest neutralino \u02dc \u03c70\n2is predominantly wino-like.\nIn both scenarios, the remaining input parameters are scanned over the following\nranges:\n200 GeV \u2264ML\u2113=ME\u2113\u2264800 GeV , (3.3)\n3 TeV \u2264M\u02dctR\u22645 TeV ,1\u2264tan\u03b2\u226450, (3.4)\n\u22125 TeV \u2264At,b,\u03c4\u22645 TeV , A u,d,e= 0, (3.5)\nwith all other soft mass parameters fixed at 5 TeV.\nIn our scan, we consider the following experimental constraints:\n(1) The mass of the SM-like Higgs boson is required to lie within the range 122 GeV <\nmh<128 GeV, accounting for theoretical uncertainties associated with two-loop\ncorrections evaluated under the approximations of vanishing external momenta and\nnegligible electroweak gauge couplings. Additionally, the Higgs signal strengths\nmust be consistent with the results from LHC measurements, as implemented in\nHiggsBounds-5.10.0 [77\u201381] and HiggsSignals-2.6.2 [81\u201383].\n(2) We impose the metastability condition for the electroweak vacuum, which requires\n|At|\u22722.67q\nM2\n\u02dcQ3L+M2\n\u02dctR+M2\nAcos2\u03b2, (3.6)\nto prevent dangerous charge- and color-breaking minima [84].\n\u2013 5 \u2013\n\n(3) The masses of sleptons are required to exceed 200 GeV, consistent with exclusion\nlimits from LEP2 and LHC searches.\n(4) The dark matter relic density must lie within the 2 \u03c3range of the Planck 2018 result,\n\u2126DMh2= 0.120\u00b10.001 [85].\n(5) The SUSY contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon must ac-\ncount for the measured deviation from the SM prediction,\n\u2206a\u00b5\u2261aexp\n\u00b5\u2212aSM\n\u00b5= (2.49\u00b10.48)\u00d710\u22129, (3.7)\nwithin a 2 \u03c3confidence level [6].\n(6) We impose constraints from current dark matter direct detection experiments, in-\ncluding bounds on the spin-independent cross section from XENONnT and related\nexperiments [86\u201392].\n(7) Collider constraints from supersymmetry searches at the LHC are incorporated via\ntheSModelS-3.00 package [72\u201376].\nIn Fig. 2, we present scatter plots of the samples that satisfy constraints (1)\u2013(4), pro-\njected onto the \u03b4aSUSY\n\u00b5 versus m\u02dc\u03c70\n1andm\u02dc\u2113planes. The blue and green regions correspond\nto the 2 \u03c3ranges within which the LWo and HWo scenarios, respectively, can account for\nthe muon g\u20132 anomaly. The key features are summarized as follows:\n\u2022For the LWo scenario :\n\u2013The bino-like \u02dc \u03c70\n1and the sleptons must be lighter than approximately 580 GeV\nand 650 GeV, respectively, to accommodate the muon g\u20132 discrepancy.\n\u2013The observed relic abundance is primarily realized through coannihilation in-\nvolving the bino-like \u02dc \u03c70\n1, the wino-like \u02dc \u03c70\n2, and the chargino \u02dc \u03c7\u00b1\n1.\n\u2022For the HWo scenario :\n\u2013Both \u02dc \u03c70\n1and the sleptons are required to be lighter than approximately 430 GeV\nin order to explain the muon g\u20132 anomaly.\n\u2013The correct relic density is achieved via coannihilation between the bino-like\nLSP and nearly degenerate sleptons.\nIn Fig. 3, we present the spin-independent (SI) and spin-dependent (SD) scattering\ncross sections of the lightest neutralino (LSP) with nucleons for the samples that satisfy\nconstraints (1)\u2013(5). In both scenarios, the LSP is predominantly bino-like, leading to highly\nsuppressed couplings to quarks and consequently small SI and SD cross sections. These are\nwell below the sensitivity of current direct detection experiments. Only a small fraction\nof the parameter space is expected to be probed by the next generation of dark matter\nexperiments.\nIn Fig. 4, we show the samples that survive constraints (1)\u2013(6), and examine their\ncompatibility with current LHC limits using SModelS-3.00 [72]. We summarize the impli-\ncations for the two scenarios below:\n\u2013 6 \u2013\n\nFigure 2 .

The regions enclosed by dotted lines indicate\nthe current 2 \u03c3range for the muon anomalous magnetic moment.\n\u2022For the LWo scenario :\n\u2013The bino-like \u02dc \u03c70\n1and wino-like \u02dc \u03c70\n2have nearly degenerate masses, while slepton\nmasses can either be close to or significantly heavier than that of \u02dc \u03c70\n1.\n\u2013Parameter points with m\u02dc\u03c70\n1\u2272265 GeV are excluded by current LHC SUSY\nsearches. The allowed range for the \u02dc \u03c70\n1mass extends up to around 580 GeV.\n\u2013Slepton masses are further constrained to 285 GeV \u2272m\u02dc\u2113\u2272630 GeV, while the\nwino-like \u02dc \u03c70\n2must lie in the range 290 GeV \u2272m\u02dc\u03c70\n2\u2272600 GeV.\n\u2013The strongest exclusion bounds arise from the ATLAS search for chargino\u2013neutralino\npair production in trilepton final states with missing transverse momentum\n(ATLAS-SUSY-2019-09 [94]).\n\u2013 7 \u2013\n\nFigure 3 . Scatter plots of the samples that satisfy constraints (1)\u2013(5), showing the spin-\nindependent and spin-dependent scattering cross sections of the lightest neutralino (LSP) with\nnucleons as a function of the LSP mass. The 90% C.L. upper limits from recent direct detection\nexperiments, including XENONnT-2023 [86], PandaX-4T-2024 [87], LZ-2024 [88], and PandaX-\n4T-2022 [89], are overlaid. Projected sensitivities from future experiments, LZ [90], XENONnT\n(20 ton-year)[91], and PandaX-xT (200 ton-year)[92], are also shown. The orange shaded region\nrepresents the neutrino floor [93], below which coherent neutrino scattering becomes a limiting\nbackground.\n\u2013Subdominant exclusions come from the ATLAS analysis targeting compressed\nelectroweakino spectra (ATLAS-SUSY-2018-16 [95]) and from the CMS elec-\ntroweak chargino\u2013neutralino search (CMS-SUS-17-004 [96]).\n\u2022For the HWo scenario :\n\u2013In this case, the bino-like \u02dc \u03c70\n1is nearly degenerate with the sleptons, while the\nwino-like \u02dc \u03c70\n2is significantly heavier.\n\u2013 8 \u2013\n\nFigure 4 . Scatter plots of the samples that survive constraints (1)\u2013(5) and the current direct\ndetection limits, shown in the planes of m\u02dc\u03c710versus m\u02dc\u03c720(left) and m\u02dc\u2113(right). The upper and\nlower panels correspond to the light-wino (LWo) and heavy-wino (HWo) scenarios, respectively.\n\u2013The mass splitting between \u02dc \u03c70\n1and sleptons is smaller than in the LWo case,\nleading to a compressed spectrum.\n\u2013Current LHC limits impose only weak constraints on this scenario.\n\u2013The most relevant exclusion comes from the ATLAS electroweakino search with\ntwo- or three-lepton final states (ATLAS-SUSY-2016-24 [97]).\n4 Probing weak gauginos at the HL-LHC and HE-LHC\nFor parameter points not excluded by SModelS , we evaluate their discovery potential at\nfuture colliders: the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) with a center-of-mass energy\u221as=\n14 TeV and integrated luminosity of L= 3000 fb\u22121, and the High-Energy LHC (HE-LHC)\noperating at\u221as= 27 TeV with L= 15 ab\u22121. For parameter points not excluded by\n\u2013 9 \u2013\n\nSModelS , we evaluate their discovery potential at future colliders: the High-Luminosity\nLHC (HL-LHC) with a center-of-mass energy\u221as= 14 TeV and integrated luminosity of\nL= 3000 fb\u22121, and the High-Energy LHC (HE-LHC) operating at\u221as= 27 TeV with\nL= 15 ab\u22121.\nThe dominant SM backgrounds arise from diboson production ( WW ,WZ,ZZ),\nZ+jets ( Zj), and top-quark associated processes ( t\u00aftandWt). Signal and background\nevents are generated using the MadGraph5 aMC@NLO [98], interfaced with Pythia [99] for\nparton showering and hadronization. Detector effects are modeled using Delphes [100],\nand event-level analyses are performed with CheckMATE2 [101\u2013103]. The statistical signifi-\ncance is estimated using the following expression:\nZ=Sp\nS+B+ (\u03b2B)2, , (4.1)\nwhere SandBare the expected numbers of signal and background events, respectively, and\n\u03b2denotes the systematic uncertainty. Throughout this analysis, we adopt a conservative\nestimate of \u03b2= 10%.\nFigure 5 . Representative Feynman diagrams for the production processes at the LHC: pp\u2192\nj\u02dc\u03c70\n2\u02dc\u03c7\u00b1\n1(left panel), relevant to the LWo scenario, and pp\u2192\u02dc\u03c7\u00b1\n1\u02dc\u03c7\u2213\n1(middle and right panels),\nrelevant to the HWo scenario.\nIn Fig. 6, the normalized distributions of Emiss\nTandm\u2113\u2113are shown for both signal and\nbackground events. Compared to the backgrounds, both signal scenarios exhibit enhanced\nevent rates in the high- Emiss\nTregion. Applying cuts based on this feature can effectively\nsuppress SM backgrounds, particularly the Zjbackground. Additionally, the LWo signal\ndisplays a concentration of dilepton invariant mass events at lower m\u2113\u2113values, whereas the\nHWo signal tends to favor larger invariant masses. Notably, the diboson and Zjback-\ngrounds exhibit a pronounced peak near m\u2113\u2113\u224891 GeV. To suppress these backgrounds,\nselection cuts should avoid this specific mass region. Based on these distinct kinematic\nfeatures, different event selection strategies are applied for the two scenarios.\nThe event selection criteria for the LWo scenario are defined as follows:\n\u2022Cut-1: Require missing transverse energy Emiss\nT>200 GeV.\n\u2022Cut-2: Select events with two opposite-sign (OS), same-flavor (SF) leptons (e.g., e+\nande\u2212). The leading lepton must satisfy p\u21131\nT>5 GeV.\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\nFigure 6 . Normalized distributions of Emiss\nTandm\u2113\u2113for the signal and background events at\nthe 27 TeV HE-LHC. The upper panel corresponds to the LWo scenario, with a benchmark point\ndefined by m\u02dc\u03c70\n1= 375 .6 GeV, m\u02dc\u03c70\n2= 401 .8 GeV, and tan \u03b2= 49.1. The lower panel corresponds to\nthe HWo scenario, with m\u02dc\u03c70\n1= 197 .9 GeV, m\u02dc\u03c70\n2= 1072 .8 GeV, and tan \u03b2= 7.4.\n\u2022Cut-3: To suppress the t\u00aftbackground, events with any identified b-jets are ve-\ntoed. Additionally, require at least one jet with leading transverse momentum\npj1\nT>100 GeV. The azimuthal angle difference between the leading jet and miss-\ning momentum must satisfy \u2206 \u03d5(j1,pmiss\nT)>2, and for all jets, \u2206 \u03d5(j,pmiss\nT)>0.4.\n\u2022Cut-4: To further reduce backgrounds, impose the following requirements:\n\u2013Veto events with reconstructed di-tau mass m\u03c4\u03c4\u2208[0,160) GeV.\n\u2013Require dilepton invariant mass 1 GeV < m \u2113\u2113<60 GeV, excluding the J/\u03c8\nresonance region by m\u2113\u2113/\u2208(3,3.2) GeV.\n\u2022Cut-5: Apply additional kinematic criteria:\n\u2013Define the scalar sum of lepton transverse momenta as Hlep\nT=p\u21131\nT+p\u21132\nT, and\nrequire Emiss\nT/Hlep\nT>max(5 ,15\u22122m\u2113\u2113).\n\u2013Require angular separation between leptons 0 .05<\u2206R\u2113\u2113<2.\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\u2013The transverse mass of the leading lepton must satisfy m\u21131\nT<70 GeV.\nTable 1 summarizes the cutflow results for the LWo scenario, detailing the impact\nof each successive selection. As shown in the table, Cut-2 substantially suppresses most\nSM backgrounds, particularly the Zjprocess, consistent with findings in Refs.

The dilepton invariant mass must satisfy\nm\u2113\u2113>25 GeV. In addition, we require no reconstructed b-jets and fewer than one\nnon-b-tagged jet ( Nnon-b-jet <1) to suppress single-top ( Wt) and t\u00aftbackgrounds.\n\u2022Cut-b: To eliminate low-mass resonances and suppress Z-boson-related backgrounds\n(WZ,ZZ,Zj), the dilepton invariant mass must satisfy m\u2113\u2113>121.2 GeV, thereby\navoiding the Z-mass peak.\n\u2022Cut-c: The missing transverse energy is required to exceed Emiss\nT>110 GeV.\n\u2022Cut-d: The missing transverse energy significance, as defined in Ref.

The dominant Zjbackground is substantially reduced\nby the dilepton invariant mass cut in Cut-b, and is rendered negligible after the missing\nenergy requirement in Cut-c. The final kinematic selection (Cut-d) efficiently eliminates\nthe residual background while maintaining high signal sensitivity.\nIn Fig. 7, we present the projected discovery significance of the LWo and HWo scenarios\nat the HL-LHC and HE-LHC.

Significance of the surviving parameter points from Fig. 4 at the HL-LHC and HE-LHC.\nThe upper and lower panels correspond to the LWo and HWo scenarios, respectively.\n\u2013For the LWo scenario, only a small fraction of parameter points are expected to\nbe probed at the HL-LHC.\n\u2013For the HWo scenario, most points remain viable. However, regions with rela-\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\ntively small \u02dc \u03c70\n2masses may be within the sensitivity reach of the HL-LHC.\n\u2022HE-LHC sensitivity:\n\u2013In the LWo case, a significant portion of parameter space with large mass split-\nting between the wino-like \u02dc \u03c70\n2and sleptons can be probed. The surviving points\ntend to lie in the mass-compressed region between \u02dc \u03c70\n2and\u02dc\u2113.\n\u2013For the HWo scenario, the viable parameter space is further reduced. In partic-\nular, regions where the wino-like \u02dc \u03c70\n2mass lies below approximately 2 TeV are\nexpected to be covered by the HE-LHC.\nIn addition to conventional cut-based analyses, applying machine learning techniques [110\u2013\n114] could further improve the sensitivity to supersymmetric particles, potentially refining\nthe reach estimates presented in this study.\n5 Conclusions\nWe have studied the LHC discovery potential for weak gauginos in the MSSM, motivated\nby the persistent 5 .2\u03c3discrepancy in the muon anomalous magnetic moment and the\nlatest constraints from dark matter and collider experiments. By scanning the parameter\nspace under bounds from Higgs measurements, relic abundance, direct detection, and LHC\nsimplified model results, we identified two viable scenarios: one with a light wino (LWo),\nand one with a heavy wino (HWo), both involving a bino-like neutralino as the dark matter\ncandidate.\nIn both scenarios, the observed dark matter abundance is obtained via co-annihilation,\neither with winos or sleptons, while maintaining SUSY contributions sufficient to explain\nthe muon g\u22122 anomaly. The LWo case permits a broader mass range, with the LSP\nand sleptons extending up to 580 GeV and 650 GeV, respectively. In contrast, the HWo\nscenario is more constrained, with upper bounds near 430 GeV. Both scenarios exhibit\ncompressed spectra, posing challenges for collider searches. Cut-based analyses at the HL-\nLHC indicate limited sensitivity, whereas the HE-LHC with\u221as= 27 TeV and L= 15 ab\u22121\ncan significantly improve coverage, probing most of the viable parameter space in both\nscenarios. The distinct kinematic characteristics of LWo and HWo suggest that tailored\nstrategies are essential for optimizing discovery potential.\nOverall, our results indicate that weak gauginos remain viable supersymmetric solu-\ntions to the muon g\u22122 anomaly. While the HE-LHC provides promising prospects for\nprobing these scenarios, further refinements, such as dedicated searches targeting com-\npressed spectra or the use of machine learning techniques, could play an important role in\nimproving sensitivity.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under\nGrant No. 12275066 and by the startup research funds of Henan University.\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nReferences\n[1]Muon g-2 collaboration, Measurement of the Positive Muon Anomalous Magnetic Moment\nto 0.46 ppm ,Phys.

One major cause factoring into this circumstance is high\ndevelopment uncertainty that manufacturers face when deploying\nthese systems in an open context. In particular, one challenge is\nestablishing a valid argument at design time that the vehicle will\nexhibit reasonable residual risk when operating in its intended\noperational design domain. Regulations, such as the European\nImplementing Regulation 2022/1426, require manufacturers to\nprovide a safety assurance argumentation for SAE-Level-4 auto-\nmated vehicles. While there is extensive literature on assurance\ncases for safety-critical systems, the domain of automated driving\nlacks explicit requirements regarding the creation of safety\nassurance argumentations. In this paper, we aim to narrow this\ngap by elaborating a requirement-based approach. We derive\nstructural requirements for an argumentation from literature and\nsupplement these with requirements derived from stakeholder\nconcerns. We implement the requirements, yielding a proposal\nfor an overall argumentation structure. The resulting \u201csafety\narguments\u201d argue over four topic complexes: The developed\nproduct, the underlying process including its conformance/com-\npliance to standards/laws, as well as the argumentations\u2019 context\nand soundness. Finally, we instantiate this structure with respect\nto domain-specific needs and principles.\nIndex Terms \u2014safety argumentation, automated vehicles\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, the testing operations of vehicles equipped\nwith SAE-Level-4 automated driving systems has been ad-\nvanced steadily on public roads, with growing fleets and ex-\npanding operational design domains. Consequently, the ques-\ntion arises as to why automated road vehicles have not yet\nbeen commercialized on large scale.\nOne reason lies in uncertainty when it comes to deploying\nsuch systems in an open context1like the road traffic system.\nAutomated vehicles are exposed to various kinds of uncer-\ntainty, e.g., regarding measurements or the prediction of the\nbehavior of other road users. Knowledge gaps are inevitable,\nresulting in incomplete specification of requirements which,\nThis work was supported by the German Federal Ministry for Economic\nAffairs and Climate Action within the project \u201cAutomatisierter Transport\nzwischen Logistikzentren auf Schnellstra\u00dfen im Level 4 (ATLAS-L4)\u201d.\n1Refers to an environment that cannot be fully specified at design time,\neither due to its complexity, unpredictability, or temporal development [1].in turn, condition incomplete testing. These functional and\nsystemic causes lead to an inherent risk to automated vehicles\u2019\noperation that can be reduced but never eliminated [2], [3].\nDue to these effects of uncertainty, established practices of\nmainly consolidating the evidence stemming from activities\nin the safety lifecycle is not sufficient any longer to target\nthe preparation of a valid basis for releasing SAE-Level-4\nsystems. Instead, to account for uncertainty, there is a need for\na coherent argument that makes assumptions explicit regarding\nhow the absence of unreasonable risk2is achieved and argues\nhow valid these assumptions remain during field operation.\nFrequently also referred to as \u201csafety case\u201d (see section II-A\nfor a terminological delimitation), one common approach to\nrespond to this task is a \u201csafety assurance argumentation\u201d.\nCrafting such an artifact is expected by regulation [5, An-\nnex I, Appendix 1, Part 2, 1.1] and standards [4], [6]\u2013[8].\nAlthough it is possible to realize argumentations at different\nlevels of formalization, a semi-formal representation (e.g.,\nGoal Structuring Notation (GSN), see [9]; originally proposed\nby Kelly [10]) appears to be a suitable compromise, as a\ntextual degree of freedom is largely sustained while concepts\nlike hierarchization and modularization are utilized to manage\ncomplexity of the argumentation.\nSafety assurance argumentations for complex systems have\nbeen comprehensively researched and addressed by literature\nfor decades [10]\u2013[14]. Regarding the safety assurance of\nautomated vehicles, emerging standards, research publications,\nand best practices impact the evolving state of the art in the\ndomain \u2013 carrying implicit knowledge on the underlying line\nof argumentation which yields the processes, methods, and\nrequirements presented in respective documents. Nonetheless,\nalthough extensive literature deals with different aspects on\ncreating safety assurance argumentations, the state-of-the-art\nlacks an explicit provision of requirements for structuring a\nGSN-based safety assurance argumentation \u2013 especially when\naiming to construct an argumentation that accounts for needs\nand principles that are particular relevant to the domain of\n2\u201cRisk judged to be unacceptable in a certain context according to valid\nsocietal moral concepts\u201d [4, Part 1, 3.176].\n\nautomated driving.\nHence, in this paper, first, we analyze terminological in-\nconsistencies and address these by providing an ontology\n(Section II-A). This is followed by an overview of related\nwork (Section II-B). Second, we derive requirements for the\ncreation of a safety assurance argumentation based on relevant\nliterature and identified stakeholder concerns (Section III).\nThird, we provide an overview of our proposed argumentation\nstructure as a result of the domain-specific implementation of\nthe specified requirements (Section IV). Finally, we discuss\nopen issues with respect to the presented approach before\nconcluding our paper (Section V).\nII. BACKGROUND\nA. Terminology\nThe terms \u201csafety case\u201d and \u201csafety assurance argumenta-\ntion\u201d are often used interchangeably. A conceptual distinction\nis illustrated by Fig. 1 to clarify on their relationship, facil-\nitating communication between stakeholders having concerns\nwith respect to the documentation of system safety.\nThe overarching concept is an \u201cassurance case\u201d, defined\nas an \u201cauditable artifact that provides a convincing and sound\nargument for a claim on the basis of tangible evidence under a\ngiven context\u201d [8, 3.1.1]. While the principles of an assurance\ncase apply equally for different properties of a complex system\nwhose proof is pursued [15], the specific concern for a safety\ncase is the emergent property safety . Hence, the latter can be\nunderstood as a dedicated instantiation of an assurance case.\nMultiple standardized definitions (e.g., [6, 4.2.37], [16,\n3.15], and [4, 3.136]) exist that share certain characteristics at-\ntributed to a safety case. Correspondingly, there is an objective\nto prove safety by a structured argument that is supported by\nevidence and considered in a specific environment ( context ).\nIn accordance, Fig. 1 visualizes that evidence supports the\nclaim of sufficient safety as the argumentation objective. Yet,\nas safety is defined as absence of unreasonable risk in the\ncontext of road vehicles [4, Part 1, 3.132], the basis of the\nargumentation relies on residual risk. Implications for the start-\ning point of the argumentation are discussed in Section IV-A.\nDistinguishing a \u201csafety assurance argumentation\u201d from a\n\u201csafety case\u201d emphasizes the particular task of building a\ncoherent argumentation that goes beyond consolidating evi-\ndence generated during safety assurance processes.3Instead, a\ndedicated argumentation artifact is required that demonstrates\nthe contributions of documented work products to achieve the\nabsence of unreasonable risk. This is pursued by systematically\ndecomposing claims using strategies and references to evi-\ndence and context. The modeled claims as well the evidences\nare valid in a specific context \u2013 see [17] for a discussion of\ncontext dependency for automotive safety arguments. In line\nwith [9], context elements especially comprise justifications\nof claims and assumptions that need to be made explicit at\ndifferent points in the argumentation.\n3This perspective is supported by requirements defined in the recently\npublished ISO PAS 8800:2024 [7, 7.3.4 e)].Thus, the safety case comprises the safety assurance argu-\nmentation, which in this paper is understood as a GSN-based\nmodel, but also the documentation associated with evidence\nand context elements referenced within the argumentation.\nThis interpretation is shared by [18, 1] concerning an \u201cassur-\nance argument\u201d and its instantiation as a \u201csafety argument\u201d\nwhen the considered property is safety. Accordingly, a safety\nargument forms a \u201csafety case\u201d once it is considered together\nwith the \u201cmaterials it references.\u201d However, we recommend\nthe usage of \u201cargumentation\u201d instead of \u201cargument\u201d, as \u201csafety\narguments\u201d are a common label for distinct branches within\nan argumentation (see [13], [12]).\nB. Related Work\nStructure and content of assurance cases are covered by\nstandards [8], best practices [15], and publications that provide\nthe required \u201ctools\u201d like GSN [9]. With respect to developing\nsafety cases for complex systems, comprehensive guidance is\navailable [10], [13], [14] that deals with challenges/pitfalls and\nresponds with methodological approaches.\nIn [12], [13], [19]\u2013[21] the task of structuring a safety case\nis addressed, especially supported by differentiating safety\nargument types such as risk, confidence, and operational argu-\nments. In [19], a layered approach for safety argumentations\nis proposed as an adaption of the risk/confidence argument\napproach \u2013 emphasizing the necessity for conceptualizing a\nstructured approach to create safety argumentations.\nThe standard UL 4600 addresses the creation of safety cases\nfor autonomous systems. Conformance to this standard pro-\nmotes sufficiency of a claim-based safety case, as the standard\n\u201cputs forth assessment criteria to determine the acceptability of\na safety case\u201d [6, 1.2.3]. Still, neither does it present a process\nnor does it direct the construction of a concrete argumentation.\nAn example to allow for operationalizing implicit principles\nof UL 4600 is presented in [22], with argumentation patterns\nbeing proposed in the context of safety performance indicators.\nDomain-specific literature on safety argumentations in-\ncludes work in the context of functional safety [4], [17],\n[23] or safety of artificial intelligence [7] for road vehicles.\nWhile the aforementioned references are equally applicable\nto conventional vehicles, specific needs for structuring an\nargumentation for vehicles equipped with automated driving\nsystems must be accounted for in particular.\nManufacturers partially disclose safety assurance ap-\nproaches of automated vehicles to the public, e.g., mani-\nfested as text-based safety reports. Yet, a coherent line of\nargumentation is not apparent with these representations and\nmerely implicitly captured. Publications detailing safety case\napproaches (e.g., [24]) indicate how certain aspects could be\nincorporated into an organization\u2019s internal GSN-based argu-\nmentation. Aurora [25] presents a hybrid representation that\nis oriented towards GSN, revealing a superordinate structure\nof an argumentation \u2013 yet, is rather tailored for external\nstakeholder communication because it can be navigated in-\nteractively but refrains from providing evidence to the claims\nmade.\n\nOntology\nGSN-focused RelationshipsAssurance Caseis instantiation of generated\ndocumentation\nassociated with\nGSN referencescontains\ncontains\naddresses concern of\nSafety Assurance\nArgumentationSafety Argumentsencapsulates\nGSN ContextClaims\n=\u2227GSN GoalEvidence\n=\u2227GSN Solution\nGSN Strategyreferences\nreferencesdecomposes\nargued viavalid in supported\nby\nvalid inSafety Case\nsufficient safety\nreasonable\nresidual riskargues for ( objective )\nargues over ( basis )is defined\nasis specific\nconcern for\nsupports proof of\nG1\nS1\nG2 G3 G4\nS2 S3 S4C1\nC2\nG5 G6 G7 G8 G9 G10\nSn1 Sn2 Sn3 Sn4 Sn5 Sn6Semi-formal Argumentation\n(GSN Model Illustration)Fig. 1.

Still,\nthese lack traceability to an underlying basis, i.e., miss an\nevident reasoning for the resulting argumentation structure.\nIII. REQUIREMENTS\nIn the following, relevant literature is examined to derive\nmacro- and microstructural requirements in Section III-A.\nThe former refer to requirements towards the superordinate\nstructure, i.e., the distinction of individual safety arguments.\nThe latter refer to requirements towards the subordinate struc-\nture, i.e., the specific contents that shall be covered in the\ndownstream argumentation contained in the safety arguments.\nBased on our experience in creating and assessing safety argu-\nmentations, stakeholder concerns are identified and translated\ninto supplementary structural requirements in Section III-B.\nA. Literature-based Requirement Derivation\nFollowing Hawkins et al. [12, p. 6], a clear distinction\nbetween \u201crisk arguments\u201d and \u201cconfidence arguments\u201d is a\nkey factor to providing compelling safety argumentations.Risk arguments shall capture the direct causal chain of risk\nmitigation ( \u25b6R1) whereas confidence arguments shall support\nthe confidence in the risk argument, i.e., its adequacy [11],\n[13].\nAssurance Claim Points have been introduced to explicitly\ncapture this relationship and indicate the assertions in a risk\nargument whose adequacy is argued for in separate confidence\narguments [9], [12]. Hence, there are fragments to the \u201coverall\nconfidence argument\u201d ( \u25b6R2) distributed within the safety\nargumentation [12]. Assurance Claim Points are also used in\nautomotive safety arguments [23].\nKelly [11] introduces the \u201cconformance/compliance argu-\nment\u201d as an additional safety argument type that argues for\nadherence to relevant standards, regulations, and legislation.\nIn [15, 2:5.2.1] the categorization via aforementioned argu-\nmentation types is adopted but the authors use the label\n\u201cconformance argument\u201d only. While literature often refers\nto compliance with standards (e.g., [27], [28]), the Assurance\nCase Working Group defines conformance as \u201cvoluntary ad-\nherence to a standard, specification, guide, process or practice\u201d\n\nand compliance as \u201cforced adherence to a law, regulation,\nrule or process\u201d [15]. However, against the assumption in\n[15] that compliance subsumes under conformance, we deem\ndistinguishing the two dimensions helpful to nurture clarity\nin stakeholder communication and preserve the corresponding\nargumentation focus. This is especially relevant, as regulatory\nrequirements are mandatory whereas arguing for conformance\nincludes an upstream identification (and potentially disqualifi-\ncation) of relevant normative requirements. This is also in line\nwith the distinction made in [29]. Thus, we propose a confor-\nmance argument ( \u25b6R3) and a compliance argument ( \u25b6R4)\nthat encapsulate arguments that the development adheres to\nnormative and regulatory requirements, respectively.\nArguing \u201csafety through direct appeal to features of the\nimplemented item\u201d is often termed as product argument and\narguing through \u201cappeal to features of the development and\nassessment process\u201d is often termed as process argument [4,\nPart 10, 5.3.1]. This classification is supported by other ISO\ndocuments [7, 8.5.1] as well as research [20], [26], [30],\nleading to \u25b6R5.\nPreceeding explanations yield the following requirements:\nMACROSTRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS\nThe superordinate safety argumentation shall include a...\nrisk argument that argues over risk reduction. \u25b6R1\ndistributed overall confidence argument that argues\nwhy elements or their assertion in the risk argument\nshould be trusted. \u25b6R2\ncompliance argument that argues for adherence to\nregulatory requirements. \u25b6R3\nconformance argument that argues for adherence to\nnormative requirements. \u25b6R4\nrisk argument comprising a product argument and\naprocess argument . \u25b6R5\nWhile the overarching goal of the risk argument is to\nargue over risk management, Kelly emphasizes that this is\ndirectly related to arguing over the appropriate management\nof hazards [10]. This includes the elimination or mitigation of\nall identified hazards posed by the system as well as linking\nit to the resulting risk. Similarly, Hawkins et al. highlight\nthat \u201ceverything that is included as part of a risk argument\nmust have a direct role as part of the causal chain to the\nhazard\u201d [13], consequently yielding \u25b6R6.\nPalin and Habli [17, Fig. 3] consider a \u201cThrough Life\nSafety Argument\u201d as part of the \u201cHigh Level Vehicle Safety\nArgument Pattern\u201d they present \u2013 marking another requirement\nthat emerges from the demand to account for the operational\nphase, i.e., to argue over the whole system lifecycle ( \u25b6R7).\nThis concern becomes also evident in [14], as the authors\nextend the top-level claim of sufficient safety by the notionof \u201cthroughout its entire operational life.\u201d4\nWagner and Carlan incorporate the claim that the developing\norganization is trustworthy in the superordinate structure of\ntheir argumentation framework [27], allocating it next to the\nrisk argument. This consideration is related to arguing over an\nimplemented safety culture and also addressed by UL 4600 [6]\nas well as Aurora [25]. This aspect is captured via \u25b6R8.\nPreceding explanations yield the following requirements:\nMICROSTRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS\nThe subordinate safety argumentation shall argue over...\nhazards posed by a system and discuss how these\nhazards are managed by adequate measures. \u25b6R6\nsystem lifecycle considerations, including operational\naspects related to post-deployment activities. \u25b6R7\nhow the process accounts for both procedural but also\nunderlying organizational aspects, such as establish-\nment of a safety culture . \u25b6R8\nB. Additional Requirements Based on Stakeholder Concerns\nWhile the elicitation of macro- and microstructural require-\nments stems from identifying common principles according to\nliterature, the need for additional requirements arises when\nstakeholder concerns are considered. Internal stakeholders\n(e.g., function developers, managers, or safety engineers)\ninvolved in the argumentation\u2019s creation often possess implicit\nknowledge that enables comprehension of all aspects of the\nargumentation. In order to allow for conscious assessments by\nexternal stakeholders, e.g., in the course of audits by certi-\nfication agencies or type approval authorities, we encourage\nto explicate this knowledge. This intention is especially tied\nto the objective of achieving a safety argumentation structure\nthat is self-explanatory to the highest degree possible.\n\u25b6R9 Contextualization Argument On the one hand, this\nnecessiates a sufficient contextualization of the argumentation\nobjective, i.e., providing sufficient context that, in turn, es-\ntablishes an adequate argumentation basis for the downstream\nargumentation complexes. This contextualization can be un-\nderstood as an \u201conboarding\u201d of external stakeholders. From\nour experience, implicit knowledge is also associated with\nindividual concepts, terminology, and abbreviations leveraged\nby an organization when creating the argumentation. Com-\nplementary, we deem a basic contextualization of the system\nof interest and its operation as important context dimensions,\nideally encapsulated in a devoted contextualization argument.\n\u25b6R10 Soundness Argument Additionally, we propose\na soundness argument that argues over different measures to\naccount for uncertainty. We consider an argument to \u201csound\u201d\nif domain experts can judge that the remaining uncertainty\nfrom an argumentation has been sufficiently mitigated. In the\n4In this regard, Fenn et al. [21] extend the concept of Assurance Claim\nPoints by introducing \u201coperational claim points\u201d to allow for establishing\noperational arguments that can be understood as a runtime-focused perspective\nassociated with the risk argument.\n\ncontext of a safety assurance argumentation, different sources\nof uncertainty exist, including uncertainty regarding the valid-\nity of claims\u2019 inference, the scope and relevance of context,\nas well as the relevance and the validity of evidence [8, 4.1].\nTo enable comprehension of external stakeholders, the\nsoundness argument shall argue over all applied methods that\nwere used for the creation and maintenance of the argumenta-\ntion to ensure its soundness. As already introduced, Assurance\nClaim Points can be utilized to reduce uncertainty in the\nappropriateness of GSN elements and their assertions within\na graphical argument. Hence, the soundness argument may\ninclude the reasoning of the \u201coverall confidence argument\u201d\n(see [13]) where this reasoning provides insights on the\nselection of elements in the risk argument that are associ-\nated with Assurance Claim Points but also on explanations\nhow the aggregation of Assurance Claim Points purpoesfully\ncontributes to an overall satisfactory level of confidence. Other\nmeasures include for example independent reviews or methods\nto identify and manage weaknesses (e.g., by using challenges\nand defeaters ) as complementary steps to developing a risk\nargument [13]. As an example for quantitative assessments,\nHerd and Burton propose the use of Subjective Logic to\npropagate uncertainty in GSN-based argumentations [31].\nPreceeding explanations yield the following requirements:\nSUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS\nThe superordinate safety argumentation shall include a...\ncontextualization argument addressing relevant\ncontext dimensions to allow for comprehension of the\ndownstream argumentation. \u25b6R9\nsoundness argument that argues over applied meth-\nods to account for uncertainty in the argumentation\u2019s\noverall validity. \u25b6R10\nIV. ARGUMENTATION APPROACH\nFig. 2 illustrates our proposed structure of a safety assurance\nargumentation that satisfies the defined requirements. In the\nremainder of this section, we will provide a summary of\nthe proposed structure and describe its instantiation due to\ndomain-specific principles in the field of automated driving.\nMeasures argued over in the soundness argument are agnostic\nto the technology since the methods considered for dealing\nwith uncertainties are argumentation-theoretical in nature.\nHence, we refrain from discussing its contents in-depth.\nThe underlying line of argumentation follows a GSN model\nthat is oriented towards the VVMethods project\u2019s argumenta-\ntion framework in [26]. However, several aspects are adapt-\ned/extended to achieve an argumentation that fulfills all spec-\nified requirements. This includes introducing a contextualiza-\ntion and soundness argument, explicitly addressing conformity,\nor distinguishing risk acceptance criteria regarding their ab-\nstraction level, as we discuss in the subsequent subsections.A. Top-level Claim\nThe claim of a system being safe has to be accompanied by a\ndefinition of what constitutes safe operation, as also suggested\nin [1], [12], [13], [17], [27]. The need for justifying the top-\nlevel claim is also formulated as a normative requirement,\nlinked to comments on this justification\u2019s critical character\nsince it \u201cdrives the assurance case\u2019s formulation\u201d and \u201cserves\nas a means for communicating\u201d [32].\nFollowing Fleischer [33], we argue that, from a linguistic\npoint of view, safety is an \u201copen signifier\u201d, leaving the term\nwith both enabling and impeding effects on interdisciplinary\ncommunication. This is due to the term\u2019s openness, condi-\ntioning both an alleged societal consensus on the objective\nof deploying \u201csafe\u201d automated vehicles while implicit and\ndeviating stakeholder understandings aggravate the explicit\ndetermination of a level of safety that is accepted by society.\nThe range of stakeholder perspectives on safety and risk in\nthe field is also discussed by Salem et al. [34].\nFrom an engineering perspective, there is far-reaching con-\nsensus in the domain of automated driving that safety is de-\nfined as absence of unreasonable risk (see [4], [24], [35]). This\ndefinition acknowledges that inherent risk prevents achieving\nfreedom from risk during operation. In line with [36], we\ndeem it especially important to avoid unfulfillable stakeholder\nexpectations of \u201czero risk\u201d (associated with a \u201cVision Zero\u201d)\nby explicitly representing and communicating residual risk.\nCorrespondingly, we consider the absence of unreasonable\nrisk as a favorable top-level claim. This approach is also\ntaken in literature, both within the domain (e.g., [26], [28])\nbut also for assurance cases in general \u2013 yet, with a slightly\ndifferent wording (\u201cno intolerable risk\u201d according to [15]).\nTo still account for stakeholder expectations and facilitate\ncommunication by using established labels, e.g., with respect\nto an assessor\u2019s aim to assess whether the system is \u201csafe\u201d\nwhen reviewing a safety case, we propose the contextualization\nargument as possibility to allocate further explanation how the\nconcepts of residual risk and safety relate.\nB. Contextualization Argument\nDespite the aforementioned potential to argue over the\njustification of the top-level claim by defining safety via risk\nor, conversely, relate risk to safety, content dimensions have\nto be contextualized so that external stakeholders can compre-\nhend argumentation. For instance, a system\u2019s definition and a\ndescription of its operating role and environment can pose\ntop-level contextual elements [8]. We regard the following\ndocumentation as highly relevant for automated vehicles:\n\u2022Operational Concept according to [37], including\n\u2013An Operational Design Domain (cf. [38]), and a\n\u2013Behavior specification and associated competencies\n(cf. [39], [40])\n\u2022Concept of Operations according to [37]\n\u2022System Description (cf. [4], [35])\n\u2022Concept explanations (e.g., the introduced inherent risk ).\n\nsupporting argumentation & evidence\nargumentation\nbasis\nargumentation\nobjective\nR1\nRisk Argument\nR5\nR3\n R4\nR10\nR9\nR6\nR7\nR8\nR2establish distributed Confidence Argument by targeted use of Assurance Claim Points\nargue over usage of Assurance Claim Points... ... ... ... ...Top-level Claim\nProcess\nArgumentProduct\nArgumentSoundness\nArgument\nCompliance\nArgumentConformance\nArgumentContextualization\nArgumentFig. 2. Conceptual illustration for structuring a safety assurance argumentation based on the implementation of the requirements specified in this paper.\nThe satisfy relationship ( ) represents the allocation of elicitated requirements, with macrostructural and supplementary requirements posing the primary\nbasis for distinguishing the safety arguments. The aggregation relationship ( ) visualizes hierarchical decomposition. The microstructural requirements are\nassociated with the supporting argumentation contained in both the product and process argument.\nC. Process Argument\nThe process argument deals with aspects that contribute\nto answer whether the developing organization is capable of\ndeveloping an automated vehicle that is free from unreasonable\nrisk. On the one hand, this comprises covering cultural aspects.\nIn this regard, the argumentation addresses the establishment\nof a safety culture [4, Part 1, 3.137] within an organization,\ne.g., by arguing over safety policies or safety-related trainings\nand onboarding procedures of employees ( \u25b6R8).\nFurthermore, this refers to arguing over the development\nprocess and post-deployment activities (cf. [37]) that guide\nthe safety assurance activities. The argumentation needs to\nprovide an adequate information basis regarding the definition\nand assessment of relevant sub-processes in subsequent phases\nas well as the proof for the deployment of these processes. This\nproof may be provided by evidence emerging from conducted\nreviews, attesting that defined processes are practiced.\nThe distinction of sub-processes can be derived from tech-\nnical processes that subsume under the lifecycle processes\nconsistent with system engineering standards [37]. The life-\ncycle perspective is not only accounted for by the associated\noperation and maintenance sub-processes that define post-\ndeployment activities ( \u25b6R7) \u2013 but also by arguing that the\nprocesses are scrutinized and, in case of identified deficiencies,\nadapted in order to achieve continuous improvement.\nOne major aspect factoring into the assessment of the pro-\ncesses\u2019 suitability is the adherence to normative and regulatory\nrequirements. Therefore, the process definition is supported by\nthe adjacent conformity and compliance arguments.1) Conformity Argument: Even if the codification of the\nstate of the art is one of the objectives of standardization, there\nis no agreed-upon state of the art that prescribes which norma-\ntive documents are to be taken into account when developing\nautomated vehicles. This situation is made particularly difficult\nby the fact that the normative landscape is dynamic. Normative\ndocuments, which exhibit varying degrees of maturity and\npresent both complementary but also competing approaches,\ncurrently appear at high frequency [36]. Therefore, a compre-\nhensive and critical (see also [41, 2.1.3]) analysis is required\nthat provides a rationale for selecting normative documents,\ni.e., for gathering the relevant normative requirements that\ndetermine the definition of the development process.\nAs the analysis of standards involves multiple assumptions,\nit is particularly important to guarantee traceability within the\nargumentation. This traceability shall be established between\nnormative requirements associated with the underlying stan-\ndards in the conformity argument and the resulting decisions\nfor the process design argued for in the process argument. As\nKelly [11] explains, an overlap of a conformance argument\nwith the risk argument should exist.\n2) Compliance Argument: The compliance argument fol-\nlows argumentation principles that are comparable to those\nof the conformity argument. Yet, arguing for adherence with\nregulatory requirements demands an ex-ante translation into\nengineering requirements in the first place. This task is es-\npecially aggravated, as legal texts are often characterized by\ntheir open nature. There still is a lack of court rulings that\nprovide practical interpretations of legal clauses in the context\nof automated vehicles. Additionally, as discussed in [42], [43],\n\nchallenges are present due to differences in the conceptualiza-\ntion of safety in different legal frameworks.\nD. Product Argument\nWhile the process argument provides evidence for the orga-\nnization\u2019s capabilities, the product argument provides evidence\nthat the vehicle possesses the capability to not pose unreason-\nable risk when operating inside its operational design domain.\nThe main argumentation principle supporting this claim is the\nfulfillment of stakeholder-dependent risk acceptance criteria,\ni.e., the system satisfies specified risk thresholds.\nTo this end, we propose distinguishing between \u201cglobal\u201d\nand \u201cscenario-based\u201d risk acceptance criteria. A similar de-\nlimitation of complementary perspectives is presented in [24],\n[28]. The global perspective refers to a scenario-independent\nevaluation of the aggregated system performance by statistical\nmeans. This requires gathering data during the automated\nvehicle\u2019s operation in its designated operating environment.\nIn contrast, scenario-based acceptance criteria correspond to a\nscenario-based risk evaluation.\nFrom an argumentation standpoint, both argumentation\nstrands follow the same pattern: Acceptance criteria of the\nrespective abstraction level need to be defined in accordance\nwith stakeholder expectations, evaluated to be met, and be\nmaintained. Arguing for maintenance reflects in conducting\nfield operation, gathering evidence, and ensuring that safety-\nrelated incidents do not violate the criteria after deployment.\nIn terms of scenario-based acceptance criteria, in line with\nISO 21448 [35], we argue over residual risk in known and\nunknown scenarios the vehicle might encounter during its\noperation. On the one hand, sufficient confidence needs to be\nestablished that residual risk in unknown scenarios will not\nresult in the violation of any acceptance criterion. On the other\nhand, the risk reduction in known hazardous scenarios has to\nbe carried out sufficiently. This comprises estimation of the ac-\ntual risk posed by the vehicle, specification of the tolerable risk\ntarget, and implementation of safety measures to iteratively\nreduce the risk until it is at least reduced to a tolerable level for\nthe respective scenarios under consideration. Following [44],\nthe former two activities relate to risk assessment and the\nlatter corresponds to risk treatment. The argumentation dealing\nwith the risk treatment is associated with a safety concept\nthat contains the safety requirements and derived measures\n\u2013 consequently, yielding the argumentation that all identified\nhazards are sufficiently mitigated or eliminated, as suggested\nby literature ( \u25b6R6).\nV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this paper, we tackled the issue of creating a safety\nassurance argumentation for automated vehicles. To this end,\nfirst, we proposed an ontology that distinguishes between the\nartifacts \u201cassurance case\u201d, \u201csafety case\u201d, and \u201csafety assurance\nargumentation\u201d and connected them with relevant concepts\nand GSN model elements. Thereby, we aim to contribute to\nfacilitated stakeholder communication by providing a harmo-\nnized terminology that dismantles inconsistencies.Second, we derived requirements for structuring a safety\nassurance argumentation based on commonalities and differ-\nences in relevant literature. We defined supplementary require-\nments as a result of considering stakeholder concerns derived\nfrom our experience. We implemented all requirements, yield-\ning a requirement-based argumentation structure.\nThird, we instantiated the resulting structure based on\ndomain-specific principles, i.e., presented the core argumenta-\ntion principles of a detailed GSN model underlying this paper.\nWhile the state of the art for safety assurance processes is\nnot explicitly defined, normative documents capture respective\nrequirements. In contrast, the field lacks standardization in\nterms of informing the creation of GSN-based safety assurance\nargumentations. We deem a harmonized requirement-based\napproach valuable to promote consistency in argumentations.\nHowever, by nature, the structure of arguments is always\ncharacterized by subjectivity. To account for associated un-\ncertainty, we particularly emphasize the relevance of making\nassumptions in the argumentation as well as underlying knowl-\nedge explicit. Thus, the introduced \u201csoundness argument\u201d and\n\u201ccontextualization argument\u201d can pose important concepts that\nrequire further research, e.g., with respect to the questions\nof how to adequately represent evidence uncertainty or how\nbeneficial contextualization can be achieved.\nWith respect to different stakeholders affected by automated\nvehicles\u2019 development and deployment, one research complex\nwe want to investigate in the future refers to manifestations\nof assurance cases. It might be reasonable to have a core\nassurance case model that addresses basic argumentation prin-\nciples which apply for different properties \u2013 and derive views\nfor different stakeholders, such as a conformity or a com-\npliance case for certification agencies or legal stakeholders,\nrespectively. The idea of having multiple assurance cases for\na system whose selection is based on needs and characteristics\nof different audiences is also supported in [8, 4.1]\nAs emphasized by Nolte et al. in [43], value conflicts\nsuch as the weighing of mobility against physical wellbeing\nis decisive when aiming to achieve public acceptance of\nautomated vehicles. The discussed argumentation allows for\nconsidering different dimensions of harm, e.g., the harm to\nmobility. With risk being defined as \u201ccombination of the\nprobability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that\nharm\u201d [4, p. 3.128], the concept of stakeholder-dependent risk\nacceptance criteria we introduced can, hence, apply for various\nkinds of risk that are prioritized differently by the relevant\nstakeholders. In the future, we want to further research how\nthebudgeting of risk can be realized and accounted for in\nthe argumentation \u2013 for instance, the specification of tolerable\ntarget risk (see Section IV-D) requires acknowledging that\nthe accepted risk associated with physical harm is influenced\nby the risk to mobility that society is willing to accept, as\nparametrization of speed in behavior planning determines the\ntrade-off of physical wellbeing and mobility to all road users.\nIn future work we want to provide in-depth insights into\nour GSN model and discuss the explicit lines of argumentation.\nAdditionally, we want to address following research questions:\n\n\u2022How do we conceptualize the evolving character (adap-\ntion, extension, instantiation...) of a safety assurance\nargumentation from a process perspective?\n\u2022What are systematical means to establish a sufficient\ndegree of traceability between different representations\nfor arguing safety, e.g., between safety reports, GSN-\nbased models, and formal representations?\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe thank Olaf Franke, Jonas Kruss, and Klaus Lamm\nfrom MAN Truck & Bus SE for their valuable input and\ncontributions to the proposed argumentation approach.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S.

INTRODUCTION\nThe most fundamental description of a probability am-\nplitude for a scattering process of particles in a Quantum\nField Theory (QFT) is given by scattering amplitudes.\nThey can be expressed as a perturbative expansion in\nterms of multi-loop Feynman diagrams in the small cou-\npling region. Such bare loop amplitudes are usually sin-\ngular when defined explicitly in four spacetime dimen-\nsions. In phenomenological applications, the most com-\nmon procedure which allows to avoid such singularities is\ndimensional regularization (dimReg) in d= 4\u22122\u03f5around\n\u03f5\u21920. In gauge theories, these singularities are univer-\nsal i.e. they can be predicted without computing the\nwhole amplitude. Importantly, physical quantities are\nfree of singularities. Indeed, according to the Kinoshita,\nLee, and Nauenberg (KLN) theorem [1, 2], contributions\nfrom virtual and real quantum corrections in any scat-\ntering process cancel all singularities. For this reason,\nit is convenient to subtract the whole singular part of\nthe amplitude from a bare amplitude such that all the\nphysical information is contained in the finite part of the\namplitude.\n\u2217Electronic address: piotr.bargiela@physik.uzh.chIn the following, we will focus on the massless Quan-\ntum Chromodynamics (QCD) corrections to two-loop or-\nder. The ultraviolet (UV) singularities arise from cou-\npling renormalization, while the infrared (IR) singular-\nities can be extracted from correlators of Wilson lines\nin soft-collinear effective theory (SCET). The finite part\nof an amplitude is obtained by acting with UV and IR\noperators, defined later in the text, on lower-loop cor-\nrections and then subtracting these terms from the bare\namplitude. Due to the fact that the UV and IR opera-\ntors predict only the singular poles \u03f5\u2212nof the amplitude,\nthey can be defined freely up to a finite part O(\u03f50). This\nnonuniqueness leads to the existence of multiple available\nUV renormalization and IR regularization schemes, e.g.\nCatani [3] or Becher-Neubert [4, 5] scheme.\nThe main goal of this work is to express the singu-\nlar part of the amplitude in terms of Feynman integrals\ncompatible with topologies appearing in the bare ampli-\ntude, and then to choose a basis of locally finite Master\nIntegrals, thus aiming for a locally finite expression for\nthe finite part of the amplitude. To this end, we propose\na new scheme, to which we will refer as pure, defined\nsuch that the UV and IR operators have a form compat-\nible with the Feynman integrals appearing in the bare\namplitude. At the moment, available schemes allow for\nthis property only for the UV operators but not the IR.\nIndeed, the integrand of the amplitude consists of propa-\ngators involving squared loop momenta, while SCET cor-\nrelators only involve propagators linearized in loop mo-\nmenta. For this reason, the IR operators are provided in\nthe literature in their integrated form as an expansion in\npowers of \u03f5. Contrarily, we derive the pure IR operator at\ntwo loops in a form of a linear combination of Feynman\nintegrands with rational function coefficients such that,\nupon integrating over the loop momenta, they reproduce\nthe expected \u03f5\u2212nIR poles. In practice, our systematic\nansatz reconstruction of the integrand expression from\nits integrated form requires a careful disentanglement of\nkinematics from color, as well as of rational from tran-\nscendental contributions to the IR poles. It also relies on\nunderstanding the minimal basis [6\u20138] property of Feyn-\nman integrals.\nFormulating scattering amplitudes purely in four\nspacetime dimensions is of a major modern interest\nacross different collaborations. It is due to the fact that\nthis would lead to reducing the redundancy in the cur-arXiv:2505.03684v1  [hep-ph]  6 May 2025\n\n2\nrent formalism by making it more explicitly physical. At\nthe same time, it would be more appropriate for stable\nand efficient numerical evaluation. As such, it would have\nvast applications to the automation of amplitude compu-\ntations beyond the well-understood one-loop order. Lo-\ncally finite Feynman integrals can be constructed e.g. by\ninserting appropriate numerators, as in Refs [9\u201314]. This\nhas been already applied in two-loop five-point ampli-\ntude calculations, e.g. in Refs [15, 16]. An algorithm for\nfinding a basis of locally finite Master Integrals has been\nintroduced in Refs [17, 18]. It has been successfully ap-\nplied to two-loop four-point amplitude calculations, e.g.\nin Refs [19\u201323]. For loop-induced two-loop amplitudes\nwith colorless final states, the local integrand subtraction\nhas been found in Refs [24\u201327]. Numerically, the Loop\nTree Duality approach allows for local subtraction of UV\nand IR singularities, see Refs [28\u201331]. In this work, we\nuse the locally finite integrals introduced in Ref. [12] to\nform a Master Integral basis for the locally finite part of\nan example QCD amplitude with four colored particles.\nII. UV RENORMALIZATION AND IR\nREGULARIZATION\nIn this section, we review the standard way of extract-\ning from a bare scattering amplitude its finite part in a\ngeneric scheme.\nConsider an amplitude Afor some multi-particle scat-\ntering process in a given QFT. For definiteness, consider\na QFT with a single coupling gs. Nonetheless, the gen-\neral argument presented in what follows should hold also\nfor QFTs with multiple couplings. In order to regulate\nall of the UV and IR singularities stemming from loop\ncorrections to the amplitude A, we will use dimReg in\nd= 4\u22122\u03f5dimensions, with \u03f5\u21920. In the region of\na small value of the coupling, the amplitude Acan be\nperturbatively expanded as\nA=g2q\ns,b(A0,b+g2\ns,b\u00b52\u03f5\n0A1,b+\u0000\ng2\ns,b\u00b52\u03f5\n0\u00012A2,b+O\u0000\ng4\ns,b\u0001\n),\n(1)\nwhere bdenotes a bare quantity, 2 qis a process-\ndependent nonnegative integer which depends on the\nleading order correction, and \u00b50is the dimReg scale. In\nthis work, we will not consider corrections higher than\nL= 2 loops, where our counting is relative to the leading\norder. The UV singularities of the amplitude Acan be\ntreated with the coupling renormalization via\n\u03b1s,b=\u03b1(S)\ns(U(S)\n0\u2212\u03b1(S)\ns\n2\u03c0U(S)\n1+(\u03b1(S)\ns)2\n(2\u03c0)2U(S)\n2+O((\u03b1(S)\ns)3)),\n(2)\nwhere \u03b1s=g2\ns\n4\u03c0, and Sdenotes the chosen renormaliza-\ntion scheme. We are going to keep track of the scheme\nS-dependence, in order to be able to compare between\nthe schemes later on. We introduced generic UV opera-\ntorsU(S)\nLwhich depend on \u03f5and color invariants, have\npoles up to \u03f5\u2212L\u03f5, and act trivially in the color space.Upon substitution, the amplitude can be expressed as a\nrenormalized perturbative series\nA=(\u03b1(S)\ns)q\n(2\u03c0)q(A(S)\n0+\u03b1(S)\ns\n2\u03c0A(S)\n1+(\u03b1(S)\ns)2\n(2\u03c0)2A(S)\n2+O((\u03b1(S)\ns)3)).\n(3)\nThe renormalized amplitudes A(S)\nLcan be related to the\nbare amplitudes A(S)\nL,bas\n1\nc0A(S)\n0=A0,b,\n1\nc0A(S)\n1=iU(S)\n0\u00b52\u03f5\n2fA1,b\u2212qU(S)\n1\nU(S)\n0A0,b,\n1\nc0A(S)\n2=\u2212i (U(S)\n0)2\u00b54\u03f5\n4f2A2,b+i (1 + q)U(S)\n1\u00b52\u03f5\n2fA1,b\n\u2212q(q\u22121) (U(S)\n1)2+ 2qU(S)\n0U(S)\n2\n2(U(S)\n0)2A0,b,\n(4)\nwhere we define c0= (8 \u03c02\u00b52\u00b5\u22122\n0U(0)\n0)q, and the loop\nfactor f=i\n16\u03c02. We define a finite part of the amplitude\nA(S)\nL,finby acting nontrivially in the color and kinematic\nspace on renormalized amplitudes A(S)\nLwith IR operators\nI(S)\nLwhich cancel all the remaining IR singularities that\nstart at order \u03f5\u22122L, i.e.\nA(S)\n0,fin=A(S)\n0,\nA(S)\n1,fin=A(S)\n1\u2212 I(S)\n1A(S)\n0,\nA(S)\n2,fin=A(S)\n2\u2212 I(S)\n2A(S)\n0\u2212 I(S)\n1A(S)\n1.(5)\nIt is convenient to change loop-momentum integration\nmeasure of all bare amplitudes such that all the transcen-\ndental coefficients of \u03f5\u2212npoles of one-loop and two-loop\namplitudes are expressed purely in terms of logn(\u00b7) func-\ntions and \u03b6nvalues, without any remaining dependence\non log(4 \u03c0) and \u03b3E. This can be achieved by changing\nthe overall loop momentum integration measure\nAL,b=NF\nNP\u02dcAL,b, (6)\nwhere NF=1\n(2\u03c0)dis the Feynman measure, and NP=\ne\u03f5\u03b3E\ni\u03c0d/2. Note that\nNF\nNP=fS\u03f5, (7)\nwhere S\u03f5= (4\u03c0)\u03f5e\u2212\u03b3E\u03f5. After the change of integration\nmeasure from NFtoNP, the finite part of the amplitude\n\n3\nA(S)\nL,fincan be related to the bare amplitudes A(S)\nL,bas\n1\nc0\u02dcA(S)\n0,fin=\u02dcA0,b,\n1\nc1\u02dcA(S)\n1,fin=\u02dcA1,b+2i\u00b5\u22122\u03f5(qU(S)\n1+U(S)\n0I(S)\n1)\nS\u03f5(U(S)\n0)2\u02dcA0,b,\n1\nc2\n1\u02dcA(S)\n2,fin=\u02dcA2,b+2i\u00b5\u22122\u03f5((1 + q)U(S)\n1+U(S)\n0I(S)\n1)\nS\u03f5(U(S)\n0)2\u02dcA1,b\n+2\u00b5\u22124\u03f5(q(1\u2212q) (U(S)\n1)2\u22122qU(S)\n0U(S)\n2)\nS2\u03f5(U(S)\n0)4\u02dcA0,b\n\u22122\u00b5\u22124\u03f5(2qU(S)\n0U(S)\n1I(S)\n1\u22122 (U(S)\n0)2I(S)\n2)\nS2\u03f5(U(S)\n0)4\u02dcA0,b,\n(8)\nwhere c1=c0i\n2S\u03f5\u00b52\u03f5U(0)\n0.\nIII. PURE SCHEME FOR THE AMPLITUDE\nSINGULARITIES\nIn this section, we show that the singular part of\nan amplitude in the introduced pure scheme Pcan be\nwritten as a linear combination of amplitude-compatible\nFeynman integrals with \u03f5-independent coefficients, i.e.\n\u02dcAL,b\u22121\ncL\n1\u02dcA(P)\nL,fin=X\nicL,iIL,i. (9)\nOn the one hand, we expect this property to hold because\nboth singular and non-singular terms in the amplitude\noriginate in Feynman diagrams. On the other hand, the\nusual derivation of the IR operators I(S)\nLis performed in\nSCET which provides the integrals IL,iin an amplitude-\nincompatible representation using linear propagators in-\nstead of the standard quadratic ones. Specifically, we will\nrequire for Feynman integrals IL,iin the pure scheme to\nbe subsectors of the diagrammatical topologies appear-\ning in the bare amplitude. Explicitly, we will focus the\nbulk of the proof on a massless QCD, but we expect for a\nsimilar argument to hold in general. As a byproduct, we\ndescribe an ansatz reconstruction method which will play\nan important role in the next section. We will also com-\nment there on the applications of the constructed pure\nscheme.\nLet us denote by Cthe Catani IR regularization\nscheme [3] defined in the MS UV renormalization scheme,\nand by Pthe pure IR regularization and UV renormal-\nization scheme which we construct here. As a first step\ntowards defining pure UV and IR operators, let us anal-\nyse the S\u03f5and\u00b5contributions in Eq. (8). Since, bare\namplitudes \u02dcAL,bcomputed in NPmeasure do not de-\npend on S\u03f5, the UV U(S)\nLand IR I(S)\nLoperators have to\nbe defined such that S\u03f5cancels out in all \u03f5\u2212npoles. The\nway of canceling the S\u03f5-dependence is not unique. InCatani scheme, S\u03f5is canceled directly in the prefactors\nof bare amplitudes \u02dcAL,bin Eq. (8). Indeed, all UV opera-\ntorsU(C)\nLinvolve exactly one negative power of S\u03f5, while\nthe dependence of I(C)\nLonS\u03f5cancels. In pure scheme P,\nwe want for all UV U(P)\nLand IR I(P)\nLoperators, which\nwe will collectively denote as O(P)\nL, to arise from L-loop\nFeynman integrals. Therefore, we choose for each UV or\nIR operators O(P)\nLto involve exactly Lpositive powers\nofS\u03f5. In summary, we write\nU(C)\nL=S\u22121\n\u03f5\u00af\u02dcU(C)\nL,\nU(P)\nL=SL\n\u03f5\u00af\u02dcU(P)\nL,\nI(C)\nL=\u00af\u02dcI(C)\nL,\nI(P)\nL=SL\n\u03f5\u00af\u02dcI(P)\nL.(10)\nWe introduced here a notation for amplitudes and oper-\nators which distinguishes between quantities which have\nan\u03f5-dependent contribution to its mass dimension. Since\nbare amplitudes \u02dcAL,bdo not directly depend on \u00b5, we\nwrite\u00af\u02dcAL,b=\u00b52L\u03f5\u02dcAL,b, where\u00af\u02dcAL,bhas\u03f5-independent\nmass dimension, while \u02dcAL,bhas\u03f5-dependent mass dimen-\nsion. For pure UV and IR operators O(P)\nL, we demand\nfor\u00b5-dependence to cancel directly in prefactors of bare\namplitudes \u02dcAL,bin Eq. (8), i.e.\u00af\u02dcO(P)\nL=\u00b52L\u03f5\u02dcO(P)\nL. Note\nthat since S\u03f5=NF\nfNP, the pure UV and IR operators \u02dcO(P)\nL\nare defined in measure NP.\nWe will now relate pure UV and IR operators\u00af\u02dcO(P)\nL\nto the Catani UV and IR operators\u00af\u02dcO(C)\nL. We start by\ndemanding that the UV poles in both schemes are the\nsame\n\u00af\u02dcU(P)\nL=\u00af\u02dcU(C)\nL+O(\u03f50). (11)\nThen, we derive pure IR operators\u00af\u02dcI(P)\nLby using the fact\nthat bare amplitudes \u02dcAL,bin Eq. (8) have the same poles\nin both schemes, i.e.\n\u00af\u02dcI(P)\n1=\u00af\u02dcI(C)\n1+q(\u00af\u02dcU(C)\n1\u2212\u00af\u02dcU(P)\n1) +O(\u03f50),\n\u00af\u02dcI(P)\n2=\u00af\u02dcI(C)\n2\u2212q\n2(2\u00af\u02dcU(C)\n1\u00af\u02dcI(C)\n1+ (q\u22121) (\u00af\u02dcI(C)\n1)2+ 2\u00af\u02dcU(C)\n2)\n+ (\u00af\u02dcI(C)\n1+ (1 + q)\u00af\u02dcU(C)\n1) (\u00af\u02dcI(P)\n1+q\u00af\u02dcU(P)\n1) +q\u00af\u02dcU(P)\n2\n\u2212(\u00af\u02dcI(P)\n1)2\u2212(1 +q)\u00af\u02dcU(P)\n1\u00af\u02dcI(P)\n1\u2212q(q+ 3)\n2(\u00af\u02dcU(P)\n1)2+O(\u03f50).\n(12)\nNote that the pure two-loop IR operator\u00af\u02dcI(P)\n2does not\ndepend on the one-loop bare amplitude \u02dcA1,b, as Eq. (8)\nmay indicate. Indeed, since the bare one-loop amplitude\n\u02dcA1,bis multiplied by a linear combination of operators\nwith poles which cancel each other, then the finite part of\nthe bare one-loop amplitude will never contribute to the\ntwo-loop IR poles in\u00af\u02dcI(P)\n2. Thus, the one-loop bare ampli-\ntude \u02dcA1,bcontribution to \u02dcA2,finin the scheme-matching\n\n4\ncondition (12) can be substituted with its poles in \u03f5. We\nchoose these poles to be represented in the pure scheme.\nIn order to find an explicit representation of the pure\nUV and IR operators defined in the matching equa-\ntions (11) and (12), we use the result for Catani UV and\nIR operators in massless QCD [3\u20135]\n\u00af\u02dcU(C)\n0(\u03f5) = 1 ,\n\u00af\u02dcU(C)\n1(\u03f5) =\u03b20\n\u03f5,\n\u00af\u02dcU(C)\n2(\u03f5) =\u03b22\n0\n\u03f52\u2212\u03b21\n2\u03f5,\n\u00af\u02dcI(C)\n1(\u03f5) =e\u03f5\u03b3E\n2 \u0393(1\u2212\u03f5)X\n(i,j)Ti\u25e6Tj\u00121\n\u03f52\u2212\u03b3i\n0\n2Ci\u03f5\u0013\u0012\u00b52\n\u2212sij\u0013\u03f5\n,\n\u00af\u02dcI(C)\n2(\u03f5) =\u22121\n2I(C)\n1(\u03f5)\u0012\nI(C)\n1(\u03f5) +\u03b20\n\u03f5\u0013\n+e\u2212\u03f5\u03b3E\u0393(1\u22122\u03f5)\n\u0393(1\u2212\u03f5)\u0012\u03b3cusp\n1\n8+\u03b20\n2\u03f5\u0013\nI(C)\n1(2\u03f5) +H(\u03f5),\n(13)\nwith\nH(\u03f5) =1\n16\u03f5X\ni\u0012\n\u03b3i\n1\u22121\n4\u03b3cusp\n1\u03b3i\n0+\u03c02\n16\u03b20\u03b3cusp\n0Ci\u0013\n+ifabc\n24\u03f5X\n(i,j,k)Ta\niTb\njTc\nklog\u2212sij\n\u2212sjklog\u2212sjk\n\u2212skilog\u2212ski\n\u2212sij\n\u2212ifabc\n128\u03f5\u03b3cusp\n0X\n(i, j, k )Ta\niTb\njTc\nk\u0012\u03b3i\n0\nCi\u2212\u03b3j\n0\nCj\u0013\nlog\u2212sij\n\u2212sjklog\u2212ski\n\u2212sij,\n(14)\nwhere the lower indices i, j, k label coloured external par-\nticles in the amplitude A,sij= (pi+pj)2are Mandelstam\nvariables, p\u03bd\niis the momentum of a particle i,P\n(\u20d7i)de-\nnotes a sum over all nonequal indices \u20d7i, the sum over up-\nper color indices a, b, c is implicit, fabcare the structure\nconstants, Ta\niis an operator acting on particle iin color\nspace [3], Ci=T2\niis the quadratic Casimir in a represen-\ntation of particle i, while the remaining transcendental\nnumbers are the L-loop coefficients in perturbative ex-\npansion of the beta function \u03b2L\u22121, the cusp anomalous\ndimension \u03b3cusp\nL\u22121, and the anomalous dimension \u03b3i\nL\u22121of\nparticle i, and they depend on a scheme for treating ex-\nternal momenta and helicity.\nNow, we are going to find the integrand form of\nthe pure UV and IR operators defined in the scheme-\nmatching equations (11) and (12). The procedure will be\nto write an ansatz for the integrand in the form of a linear\ncombination of known integrands with unknown coeffi-\ncients, and then match the poles to the scheme-matched\nintegrated form. For the integrand to be pure, we will de-\nmand it to be a subtopology of a Feynman-diagrammatic\nrepresentation of the full amplitude, in order to repro-\nduce all the transcendental functions and values purely\nfrom the loop-momentum integration, and thus for the\ncoefficients in the ansatz to be \u03f5-independent purely ra-\ntional functions of color and kinematics. Note that our\ncharacterization of the pure property is not related to thepure property introduced for integrals of uniform tran-\nscendental weight [32]. For convenience, we are going to\nconsider \u02dcO(P)\nLrather than\u00af\u02dcO(P)\nL, such that all the ansatz\nintegrands have \u22122L\u03f5contribution to their mass dimen-\nsion, just as Feynman diagrams do. As such, some of the\nintegrands may depend on the scale \u00b5. We will discuss\nhow to represent these integrals diagrammatically when\nshowing the results at the end of this section.\nLet us start by writing the integrated form of the\npure UV and IR operators stemming from the scheme-\nmatching equations (11) and (12)\n\u02dcU(P)\n0= 1,\n\u02dcU(P)\n1=\u03b20\n\u03f5+O(\u03f50),\n\u02dcU(P)\n2=\u0012\u03b22\n0\n\u03f52\u22121\n\u03f5\u0012\u03b21\n2+ 2\u03b22\n0log(\u00b52)\u0013\u0013\n+O(\u03f50),\n\u02dcI(P)\n1=X\n(i,j)Ti\u25e6Tj\u00121\n2\u03f52\u22121\n\u03f5\u0012\u03b3i\n0\n4Ci+log(\u2212sij)\n2\u0013\u0013\n+O(\u03f50),\n\u02dcI(P)\n2=w(0)\n0+X\niw(1)\ni+X\n(i,j)Ti\u25e6Tjw(2)\nij\n+X\n(i,j)Ti\u25e6TjX\n(k,l)Tk\u25e6Tlw(4)\nijkl\n+ ifabcX\n(i,j,k)Ta\niTb\njTc\nkw(3)\nijk+O(\u03f50),\n(15)\nwhere \u02dcI(P)\n2with the explicit form of coefficients w(n)is\ngiven in the ancillary files. Similarly as in the \u03f5-expanded\nform of \u02dcI(C)\n2, the coefficients w(n)depend on transcen-\ndental functions logk(\u00b7), rational numbers Ci, and on\ntranscendental numbers in \u03b2L\u22121,\u03b3cusp\nL\u22121,\u03b3i\nL\u22121. We are\ngoing to demand that the integrand ansatz integrates to\nthese expressions up to terms finite in \u03f5.\nLet us first state the integrand ansatz and then de-\nscribe its properties\n\u02dcU(P)\n1=X\nnanI(1,2)\nn(\u2212\u00b52),\n\u02dcU(P)\n2=X\nnbnI(2,2)\nn(\u2212\u00b52),\n\u02dcI(P)\n1=X\n(i,j)Ti\u25e6TjX\nndijnI(1,3)\nn(sij),(16)\nwhere \u02dcI(P)\n1can be schematically depicted as\ni j\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b71L \u02dcI(P)\n1= \u03a3(i,j)\nwhile\n\n5\n\u02dcI(P)\n2=c(0)I(2,2)(\u2212\u00b52) +X\niX\nnc(1)\ninI(2,2)\nn(\u2212\u00b52) +X\n(i,j)Ti\u25e6Tj X\nnc(2,1)\nijnI(2,3)\nn(sij) +X\nnc(2,2)\nijnI(1,3)\nn(\u2212\u00b52)I(1,2)\nn(sij)!\n+X\n(i,j)Ti\u25e6TjX\n(k,l)Tk\u25e6TlX\nnc(4)\nijklnI(1,3)\nn(sij)I(1,3)\nn(skl) + ifabcX\n(i,j,k)Ta\niTb\njTc\nkX\nnc(3)\nijkI(2,4)\nn(sij, sjk, ski)\n(17)\ncan be schematically depicted as\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ \u03a3(i,j)(i j\n+\u03a3n ) + \u03a3 ncikn +\u03a3(i,j,k)\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7i j i jk l\nij\nk\n2L 2L 1L 1L 1L 1L 2Ln n n n\u02dcI(P)\n2=\n(i, j)\n(k, l)\nHere, each blob diagram consists of a sum of Feynman integrals with \u03f5-independent rational function coefficients.\nWe sum over Feynman a set of integrals I(L,N)\nn with L\nloops and at most Nexternal legs in loop-integration\nmeasure NPwhich are subsectors of integral topolo-\ngies relevant for massless parton scattering, as shown in\nthe above diagrammatic representation. The coefficients\nan, bn, dijn, c(0), c(1)\nin, c(2,1)\nijn, c(2,2)\nijn, c(4)\nijkln, c(3)\nijkare unknown\nrational functions. The choice of the ( L, N) pair for each\ncolor factor of each pure operator arises from finding\nthe smallest values of ( L, N) for which the kinematics\nmatches the corresponding integrated form (15). We also\nrequire that each diagram is a subtopology of the whole\nmulti-point amplitude A. Alternatively, the ( L, N) pair\nchoice can be inferred from the way in which the UV and\nIR operators are usually computed in the Catani scheme.\nIndeed, since UV operators are usually computed from\nthe off-shell two-point function, then we have one-scale\n(L,2) ansatz for \u02dcU(P)\nL. Similarly, since IR operators are\nusually computed from correlators of L+ 1 Wilson lines\nin SCET [4, 5], then we have at most three-scale (2 ,4)\none off-shell ansatz for \u02dcI(P)\n2, as we consider all internal\nlines to be massless. In contrary to SCET propagators,\nwhich are linear in loop momenta, we seek a subtopol-\nogy of the full amplitude A, i.e. with standard propaga-\ntors involving squared loop momenta. Note that the way\nin which logn(\u2212sij) and logn(\u00b52) contribute to the inte-\ngrated form of the pure operators in Eq. (15) constrains\nthe ansatz for \u02dcI(P)\n2. For example, w(2)\nijrequires contribu-\ntions from both ( \u2212sij)\u22122\u03f5c(2,1)\nijnand ( \u00b52)\u2212\u03f5(\u2212sij)\u2212\u03f5c(2,2)\nijn\nin order to exponentiate correctly. In addition, note\nthatw(4)\nijklcannot be expressed in a fully factorized form\n(P\nnI(1,3)\nn(sij)c(4,1)\nijn) (P\nmI(1,3)\nm(skl)c(4,2)\nklm) but rather as\nP\nnI(1,3)\nn(sij)I(1,3)\nn(skl)c(4)\nijkln. The reason for it is re-\nlated to the constraint coming from the minimal basis\nproblem [6, 7], so let us elaborate on it now.\nIt is well known, that all Feynman integrals belong-\ning to a fixed integral topology can be related using the\nIntegration-By-Parts (IBP) reduction [33\u201336] to a finite\nset of linearly independent integrals among them, called\nMaster Integrals (MIs) [37]. For the integral topologies\nthat we consider here, the resulting MIs can be expandedin\u03f5intoP\nn\u22650\u03f5\u22122L+nTin, where Tinis a function of at\nmost transcendental weight [32] n, and ilabels the MIs.\nThe minimal basis [6, 7] is defined as a minimal set of\ncombinations of Chen iterated integrals [38] which spans\nall the transcendental functions Tinfor all MIs at fixed\norder in \u03f5. Since the minimal basis depends on the un-\nderlying integral topology, some iterated integrals may\nonly appear in this topology in a fixed combination with\nsome other iterated integrals. On the one hand, the re-\nsulting constraint on the number of independent iterated\nintegrals in a topology is very beneficial for numerical\nevaluation [6, 7] and amplitude computation [8]. On the\nother hand, it complicates our ansatz reconstruction pro-\ncedure. Indeed, the minimal basis constraints appearing\nin the MIs are also present in all of the integrals in the\ncorresponding topology by mixing with MI coefficients.\nThese constraints may be so rigid for a given topology\nthat it cannot span a generic ansatz. For example, the\nfactorized product of two one-loop topologies, mentioned\nin the end of the previous paragraph, generates all the\nexpected transcendental terms but their coefficients are\ntoo constrained to match the full integrated form w(4)\nijkl.\nLet us now describe the linear reconstruction of un-\nknown coefficients in the integrand ansatz in equa-\ntions (16) and (17). Note that the known coefficients\nw(i)in the integrated form (15) are not of pure weight,\ni.e. they do not have the same transcendental weight\nin each internal summand. Indeed, we have \u03b3cusp\n1 =\n\u03b3cusp\n1,0+\u03b3cusp\n1,2\u03c02and\u03b3i\n1=\u03b3i\n1,0+\u03b3i\n1,2\u03c02+\u03b3i\n1,3\u03b63, where tran-\nscendental numbers \u03c02and\u03b63have been completely fac-\ntored out from rational numbers. Since we do not allow\n\u03f5-dependence in the ansatz coefficients, then an ansatz\nconsisting only of canonical MIs [32] may not be com-\nplete. In order to ensure the completeness of the ansatz\nsetI(L,N)\nn , each sum over nshould range over all subsec-\ntors and crossings of all possible L-loop N-point diagram-\nmatic topologies. The ansatz basis may further consist\nof integrals with Irreducible Scalar Products (ISPs) or\ndots, i.e. higher propagator powers, up to some overall\ntotal rank. For the pure scheme UV and IR operators,\nwe prefer choosing ISPs over dots because Feynman di-\nagrams of the original amplitude Acan only have up to\n\n6\nL\u22121 dots.\nAs discussed above, for the ansatz in equations (16)\nand (17), it is sufficient to consider four-point kinemat-\nics with one off-shell leg at two loops and three-point\nkinematics with one off-shell leg at one loop, both with\nfully massless internal lines. After performing the IBP\nreduction for both planar and nonplanar topologies in\nall crossings with Reduze [39, 40], we substitute the MIs\ncomputed in Refs [41\u201343]. A generic form of the inte-\ngrated ansatz reads\nI(2,4)\nn(sij, sjk, ski) = (\u2212sijk)\u22122\u03f53X\nn=0\u03f5\u22124+n\u00d7\nX\nm,\u20d7 \u03b1, \u20d7\u03b2:m+|\u20d7 \u03b1|+|\u20d7\u03b2|\u2264nrm\u20d7 \u03b1\u20d7\u03b2\u03b6mG\u0012\n\u20d7 \u03b1,ski\nsijk\u0013\nG\u0012\n\u20d7\u03b2,sjk\nsijk\u0013\n,\n(18)\nwhere sijk=sij+sjk+ski,rm\u20d7 \u03b1\u20d7\u03b2are known ratio-\nnal functions of color and kinematic invariants, G(\u00b7) are\nGeneralized Polylogarithms (GPLs) [41, 44] with letters\n\u03b1i\u2208 {0,1}and\u03b2i\u2208 {0,1,sij+sjk\nsijk,\u2212ski\nsijk}, while for sub-\nsectors with N\u2208 {2,3}, we have\nI(L,N)\nn (sij) +O(\u03f50) = (\u2212sij)\u2212L\u03f5\u03f5L(1\u2212N)\u00d7\n(rn0+\u03f5 rn1+\u03f52(rn20+rn22\u03c02) +\u03f53(rn30+rn32\u03c02+rn33\u03b63),\n(19)\nwhere rijare known rational functions. We used\nMathematica package PolyLogTools [45] to manipu-\nlate GPLs. Note that in order to match w(3)\nijk, the\nunknown coefficients c(3)\nijkhave to arrange to cancel\nall of the GPL terms in the integrated ansatz (18)\nexcept for simple log( \u00b7) contributions present in the\nH term (14). At this point, the ansatz for the\npure UV and IR operators, i.e. Eq. (16) and\nEq. (17), can be directly compared with their known\nintegrated form (15). Since all of the resulting \u03f5-\nexpanded expressions are linear in generic transcendental\nterms \u03f5\u2212n\u03b6mG\u0010\n\u20d7 \u03b1,ski\nsijk\u0011\nG\u0010\n\u20d7\u03b2,sjk\nsijk\u0011\n, their correspond-\ning purely-rational coefficients should match. This cre-\nates a large system of linear equations for unknown coef-\nficients an, bn, dijn, c(0), c(1)\nin, c(2,1)\nijn, c(2,2)\nijn, c(4)\nijkln, c(3)\nijk. Let\nus now turn to their solutions as rational functions of\nkinematic and color invariants.\nAs a result of the outlined procedure, we not only re-\nstore the well-known Feynman integrand expressions for\none-loop UV, two-loop UV, and one-loop IR pure opera-\ntors\n\u02dcU(P)\n1=\u03b20\n (\u2212\u00b52),\n\u02dcU(P)\n2= 2(10 \u03b22\n0+\u03b21)\n (\u2212\u00b52) + 2\u03b22\n0\n (\u2212\u00b52),\n\u02dcI(P)\n1=s\u03f5\n12NX\n(i,j)Ti\u25e6Tj1\n2\u0012\nsij\n (sij) +\u03b3i\n0\n2Ci\n(sij)\u0013\n,\n(20)but we also provide a new expression the two-loop IR\npure operator \u02dcI(P)\n2in the ancillary files. Let us describe\nhere the properties of the integrand of \u02dcI(P)\n2. We start\nby noting that the linear system for unknown rational\ncoefficients an, bn, dijn, c(0), c(1)\nin, c(2,1)\nijn, c(2,2)\nijn, c(4)\nijkln, c(3)\nijkis\nunderdetermined. Indeed, when considering the full set\nof ansatz integrals, it leaves some coefficients uncon-\nstrained, while, when reducing the ansatz to only some\nspecific topologies or crossings belonging to the respec-\ntive ( L, N) kinematics, it is insufficient. The property\nof the integrand solution being not unique is expected\nsince we matched only poles of the integrated form of\nthe ansatz, i.e. any finite Feynman integral can be freely\nadded without spoiling the constraints. For simplicity,\nwe chose the set of ansatz integrals such that w(3)in\nthe ancillary files contains only planar integrals and all\nthe unconstrained integral coefficients care set to 0 to\nreduce the number of contributing integrals. In partic-\nular, the sum in w(0), w(1), w(2), w(3)runs through 1, 6,\n7, 17 two-loop integrals, with additional 2 and 4 prod-\nucts of two one-loop integrals in w(2)andw(4), respec-\ntively. Of course, it is always possible to consider a\nlarger set of ansatz integrals, e.g. to include also the\nnonplanar contributions to w(3), however, it might re-\nsult in generating rational functions of high degree and\nwith large fraction coefficients. Contrarily, considering\nan even smaller set of ansatz integrals leads to an in-\ncomplete system. This includes requiring e.g. only one\nspecific crossing contribution to w(3), or only planar con-\ntributions to w(0),w(1)orw(2), or a fully-factorized form\nofw(4)\nijkl= (P\nnI(1,3)\nn(sij)c(4,1)\nijn) (P\nmI(1,3)\nm(skl)c(4,2)\nklm), as\nmentioned earlier. The last two are equivalent to the\nstatement that neither two-loop planar nor a product of\ntwo sums of one-loop three-point internally massless inte-\ngrals with one leg off-shell can span all the \u03f5\u2212n\u03b6mterms\nbelow weight 4 with arbitrary rational coefficients. It is\ndue to too rigid minimal basis constraints.\nLet us also elaborate on further properties of the re-\nconstructed one-loop and two-loop pure UV and IR op-\nerators. Firstly, in contrary to the two-loop IR operator\nin the Becher-Neubert scheme [4, 5], \u02dcI(P)\n2has a non-\ntrivial contribution w(3)from the color tripole, as in the\nCatani scheme [3]. Since there is a nonzero contribution\nfrom the color quadrupole to the three-loop IR operator\nin the Becher-Neubert scheme [46], we expect for higher\n(L+1)-fold multipole terms to appear in \u02dcI(P)\nL. Secondly,\nwe note that there is a minor dependence of a purely-\nUV origin on qinw(0)=\u22124q\u03b22\n0\n\u03f5, which is absent in both\nCatani and Becher-Neubert schemes. Thirdly, as men-\ntioned earlier, it is possible to find a representation of\nthe pure operators as subdiagrams of the full amplitude\nA, despite the dependence on \u00b52. Indeed, it is enough\nto consider\u0010\ns\n\u00b52\u0011\u22122L\u03f5\u02dcO(P)\nLinstead of \u02dcO(P)\nL, where sis\nsome chosen squared scale which has an interpretation\ncorresponding to one of the diagrammatic channels, e.g.\na Mandelstam variable. In the ancillary files, we chose\n\n7\nto provide the integral topology definitions parametrized\nwith s=s12.\nNote that the H term (14) simplifies for processes\nwhich involve a low number of external legs. Indeed, be-\nlow four massless colored external particles, the tripole\ncontribution w(3)vanishes, while for a scattering of ex-\nactly four colored particles, without any colorless legs,\nthe kinematics of log( \u00b7) functions simplifies due to an\noverall momentum conservation s12+s23+s31= 0.\nTherefore, the integrand ansatz for the two-loop pure IR\noperator \u02dcI(P)\n2should consists of two-loop four-point in-\ntegrals with all on-shell legs. We constructed a separate\nintegrand ansatz for w(3)and we found its integrand form\nusing IBP relations generated with Reduze [39, 40] and\nMIs computed in Refs [32, 47, 48]. The function space in\nthe\u03f5-expanded ansatz simplifies such that a generic tran-\nscendental term reads \u03f5\u2212n\u03b6mG\u0010\n\u20d7 \u03b1,sij+sjk\nsij\u0011\n, where G(\u00b7)\nare Harmonic Polylogarithms (HPLs) [49] with letters\n\u03b1i\u2208 {0,1}. After solving a linear system of conditions\nfor the unknown rational coefficients c(3)\nijk, we chose a sim-\nple representation which consist of 12 integrals which are,\nsimilar to the one off-shell case, all planar and they do\nnot contain either dots or ISPs. We provide this new\nresult for the tripole contribution w(3)in the ancillary\nfiles.\nFinally, we conclude with two more general comments\non the outlined ansatz reconstruction method. Firstly, it\ndoes not restrict to some specific values of the rational\nnumbers \u03b20,\u03b21,\u03b3cusp\n0,\u03b3cusp\n1,0,\u03b3cusp\n1,2,\u03b3i\n0,\u03b3i\n1,0,\u03b3i\n1,2,\u03b3i\n1,3,\nor the color invariants. Therefore, a similar construc-\ntion should also work in different gauge theories, and\nfor other schemes for treating the external particle mo-\nmenta and helicity e.g. Conventional Dimensional Regu-\nlarization (CDR), \u2018t Hooft-Veltman (tHV), and the four-\ndimensional helicity scheme (4DH). Secondly, the ansatz\nreconstruction is even simpler when applying to a fixed\nprocess. Indeed, in such case, one can explicitly perform\nthe color operator Talgebra in Eq. (15), thus the remain-\ning integrated expressions have fixed kinematic labels\n1,2,3,4,5, ..., in contrary to generic summed-over indices\ni, j, k, l . Then, one can exploit the freedom stemming\nfrom the underdetermined system of ansatz-matching\nequations and choose an integrand representation suited\nto a particular process. As an example, we computed the\npure UV and IR operators for the q\u00afq\u2192ggscattering at\ntwo loops in massless QCD. We used qgraf [50] to gen-\nerate Feynman diagrams, FORM [51] to perform color and\nspinor algebra, and the tHV projector decomposition in-\ntroduced recently in Ref. [52]. We found that all poles\nof the bare two-loop amplitude \u02dcA2,b[53] as well as of the\npure IR operator \u02dcI(P)\n2can be spanned by the same 27\nintegrals with at most 1 ISP, including 19 planar and 8\nnonplanar integrals, which are the same in both tHV and\n4DH scheme.IV. LOCALLY FINITE PART OF AN EXAMPLE\nHELICITY AMPLITUDE\nIn this section we show how to turn the finite part\nof an amplitude defined in Eq. (8) into a locally finite\nexpression, i.e.\n1\ncL\n1\u02dcA(P)\nL,fin=X\nicL,i,fin\u02dcML,i,fin, (21)\non an example of the q\u00afq\u2192ggscattering.\nLet us start by explaining the difference between lo-\ncally and globally finite expressions. We refer to an ex-\npression as globally finite if it sums to a finite quantity\nwhile its summands may separately be singular. It means\nthat the summands have to be computed using a regu-\nlator, e.g. \u03f5, and the physical limit \u03f5\u21920 can only be\ntaken at the end of the calculation. For example, the\nright-hand side of Eq. (8) is globally finite. Contrarily,\nwe refer to an expression as locally finite if each of its\nsummands is separately finite. In dimReg, it means that\neach summand can be evaluated explicitly at \u03f5= 0 with-\nout producing any singularities, even numerically. For\nexample a massless box Feynman integral is locally finite\nind= 6.\nWe turn the finite part of an amplitude defined in\nEq. (8) into a locally finite expression in two steps.\nFirstly, we follow Sec. (III) to write the predicted singular\npart of an amplitude as a sum of amplitude-compatible\nFeynman integrals with \u03f5-independent coefficients. Sec-\nondly, we subtract these singular terms from the bare\namplitude \u02dcAL,b, and then we perform an overall IBP re-\nduction onto a common MI basis, i.e.\n1\ncL\n1\u02dcA(P)\nL,fin=\u02dcAL,b+X\njcL,jIL,j=X\nicL,i\u02dcML,i.(22)\nWe will now show on an example how to choose the MI\nbasis \u02dcML,isuch that each MI is locally finite, and how\ntheir coefficients cL,itransform.\nConsider the leading color contribution to the\n(Ta3Ta4)i1\u00afi2color factor of the q(p1) \u00afq(p2)\u2192\ng(\u2212p3)g(\u2212p4) scattering amplitude in two-loop massless\nQCD. All the Feynman diagrams of this contribution are\nplanar and have natural leg ordering, together with the\ncrossing ( p1\u2192p2, p2\u2192p3, p3\u2192p4, p4\u2192p1), which\nwe will abbreviate as x1234. As mentioned above, in the\nfirst step, following our ansatz-matching construction in\nSec. (III), we write the singular part of our amplitude\nas a sum of 15 Feynman integrals, which all belong\nintegral topologies appearing in the as the bare i.e.\nthe double-box and its x1234 crossing. We attach the\nresulting singular part of our amplitude in the ancillary\nfiles. Note that the poles of the constructed singular\npart are the same in any scheme because they have to\ncancel bare amplitude poles. While the finite part differs\nin different schemes, the relation between schemes can\nbe reconstructed from their definition. In the second\nstep, we IBP reduce both the singular part and the bare\n\n8\namplitude onto a common basis of 13 MIs.

There-\nfore, we wrote the resulting finite part of helicity ampli-\ntude in a locally finite manner, i.e. such that one can put\nd= 4 without the \u03f5regulator and perform the integration\nnumerically. In comparison, for gluon opposite-helicity\nconfigurations, the MI coefficients c2,iareO(\u03f5\u22121). This\nmeans that we have to expand our locally finite MIs to\nO(\u03f51) in order to reproduce the full finite part of the cor-\nresponding helicity amplitude. Even though the resulting\nexpression is not locally finite, it is still an improvement\nin comparison to using this MI basis for the bare am-\nplitude alone. Indeed, analytically, the MI coefficients\nare much less singular, i.e. O(\u03f5\u22121), for the finite part of\nthe amplitude than for the bare amplitude, which diverge\nas most as O(\u03f5\u22124), which would require expanding the\ncorresponding locally finite MIs to O(\u03f54). In addition,\nthe locally finite MIs are also locally finite order by or-\nder in \u03f5n, which improves the stability of their numerical\nevaluation. As a result, one can refer to the resulting\nMI basis for the gluon opposite-helicity configurations as\nquasi-finite.\nLet us comment on some possible extensions of this\nanalysis. Firstly, it would be useful to find some general\nguidance on how to choose both the integrals forming the\nsubtracted singular part of the amplitude and the basis\nof finite MIs such that their coefficients for the finite am-\nplitude part are always finite. So far, the existence of MIbasis has been proven only for each of these two proper-\nties separately, i.e. the one having all locally finite MIs in\nRefs [17, 18], or the one having all finite MI coefficients\nin Ref. [54]. For example, we chose both these integral\ntypes to be subsectors of the double-box topology and\nits crossing. Note that there is also beetle [12] topol-\nogy contribution to the Feynman diagrams. By testing\na few example choices of integrals from mixed double-\nbox and beetle topologies, we did not find any beneficial\nchoice. Alternatively, one could imagine exploiting only\nthose IBP identities which do not generate \u03f5-dependence\nin the MI coefficient. These are the identities generated\nby the external vectors p\u00b5\niand not by loop vectors k\u00b5\nl.\nSince Feynman rules do not generate any \u03f5\u2212npoles in\nthe coefficients of the unreduced integrals, then the am-\nplitude after such an altered IBP reduction would also\nhave finite coefficients of the altered integral basis. Note\nthat, in an incomplete IBP system, the size of the altered\nintegral basis is much larger than of the standard MI\nset resulting from a complete system. Moreover, is such\ncase, the dots are not always reducible in terms of ISPs.\nTherefore, it is not obvious how to guarantee the local\nfiniteness of the chosen altered integral basis. Secondly,\nit might be beneficial to investigate if there is a choice of\nboth the integrals forming the singular part of the am-\nplitude and the basis of finite MIs such that resulting\nfinite part of the virtual contribution is suppressed. This\nwould mean that the real radiation corrections dominate,\nand one could approximate the result by neglecting the\nvirtual correction. If the resulting finite amplitude part\nwas constructed to be vanishing as \u03f5\u21920, then the result\nin this approximation would become exact.\nFinally, it would be interesting to explore if all of the\nsteps necessary for writing the finite part of the ampli-\ntude in a locally finite manner can be performed using\npurely integrand-level identities. In practice, this would\nrequire avoiding the step of reconstructing an integrand\nansatz for the singular part of the amplitude from its\nintegrated form. Instead, one may map the products be-\ntween the UV/IR operators and the lower-order ampli-\ntudes appearing in Eq. (8) onto two-loop integral topolo-\ngies compatible with a given process. The most chal-\nlenging problem in this approach would be to avoid in-\ntroducing additional MIs, resulting from products of two\none-loop expressions, in a way that the locally finite MIs\nwith finite coefficients can still be found. In the consid-\neredq\u00afq\u2192ggexample, these products of one-loop expres-\nsions lead to the so called graphless [40] integral sectors,\ne.g. box multiplied with a bubble, which are not simply\none-loop-factorizable diagrams for four-point kinematics.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this work is we expressed the singular part of the\namplitude in terms of Feynman integrals compatible with\ntopologies appearing in the bare amplitude as a first step\ntowards constructing a locally finite part of the ampli-\n\n9\ntude. To this end, we proposed a new pure UV renor-\nmalization and IR regularization scheme defined such\nthat the UV and IR operators have a form consistent\nwith the Feynman integrand of bare two-loop QCD am-\nplitude. Note that these pure operators do not have a\nuniform transcendental weight. In order to find such an\nintegrand form of the pure UV and IR operators, we ex-\nploited an ansatz reconstruction method. On the exam-\nple of two-loop massless QCD, we matched their known\nintegrated form with an ansatz of a linear combination of\nFeynman integrals with unknown rational function coef-\nficients, such that all the transcendental factors i.e. \u03f5\u2212n,\n\u03b6m, and logk(\u00b7) are generated from Feynman integrals.\nAs a result, we found a class of pure UV and IR oper-\nators which are defined up to an arbitrary finite part in\n\u03f5. Due to this nonuniqueness, the exact form of these\noperators can be suited to a particular process. Consis-\ntently with the SCET argument [4, 5], the pure two-loop\nIR operator has at most a four-point one off-shell inte-\ngral topology for any multi-point scattering amplitude.\nBeyond two-loop massless QCD, we expect our construc-\ntion to work in other theories and orders, as long as the\nsingular part of the amplitude can be predicted.\nIn addition, we chose a basis of locally finite Master\nIntegrals, thus aiming for a locally finite expression for\nthe finite part of the amplitude, on an example of the\nq\u00afq\u2192ggscattering. We subtracted the predicted singu-\nlarities from the bare two-loop amplitude in their pure\namplitude-compatible form. Then, we IBP reduced the\nresulting finite part of the amplitude onto a basis of lo-\ncally finite MIs. For some helicity configurations, the\nMI coefficients are also finite in \u03f5, therefore the whole\nexpression becames locally finite, i.e. one can explicitly\nput\u03f5= 0 at the integrand level. For other helicity con-\nfigurations, the MI coefficients are singular at most as\nO(\u03f5\u22121). In comparison, the MI coefficients are singular\nupO(\u03f5\u22124) for the bare amplitude in the same MI basis.\nThere is a plethora of possible future directions which\ncould build on this work. They would have a substantial\nimpact on understanding the structure of scattering am-\nplitudes both formally and phenomenologically. Let us\nelaborate on some of them.\nRegarding the pure scheme, firstly, it would be useful\nto generalize our result to higher-loop orders. Motivated\nby the SCET argument [5, 46, 55], we expect at most\n(L+2)-point integrals to contribute to the pure L-loop IR\noperator. Secondly, one could extend our pure scheme to\ninclude also massive colored particles. The integrated ex-\npressions for such IR operators are currently available at\nthree loops for the former [5, 46, 55] and at two loops for\nthe latter [56, 57]. Thirdly, it would be interesting to ex-amine how does the minimal basis put constraints also on\nthe finite part of the amplitude. Indeed, the existence of\nthe resulting linear relations between rational coefficients\nof transcendental functions contributing to the physical\npart of the amplitude would reduce the complexity of\namplitude computations. Fourthly, the pure scheme is\ndefined such that the dependence on the renormalization\nscale \u00b5factorizes from the finite part of the amplitude.\nThis may simplify the estimation of missing higher-order\nuncertainties (MHOUs) in the perturbative expansion.\nFinally, we conclude by pointing out that the outlined\nmethod of reconstructing an integrand ansatz from an\nintegrated expression could be applied beyond UV and\nIR operators e.g. to the finite part of the amplitude or\nto individual Feynman integrals.\nRegarding the locally finite amplitude part, firstly, it\nwould be useful to find some general guidance on how\nto choose both the integrals forming the singular part of\nthe amplitude and the basis of finite MIs such that their\ncoefficients for the finite amplitude part are always finite.\nSecondly, it might be beneficial to investigate if there is\na choice of both the integrals forming the singular part\nof the amplitude and the basis of finite MIs such that\nthe resulting finite part of the virtual correction is sup-\npressed in comparison to the real radiation contribution.\nFinally, it would be interesting to explore if all of the\nsteps necessary for writing the finite part of the ampli-\ntude in a locally finite manner can be performed using\npurely integrand-level identities. This would avoid the\nstep of reconstructing an integrand ansatz for the singu-\nlar part of the amplitude from its integrated form.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was inspired by discussions with F.

However, evaluat-\ning the non-functional morality of ADSs, particularly their\ndecision-making capabilities in unavoidable collision scenarios,\nis equally important to ensure the systems\u2019 trustworthiness and\npublic acceptance. Unfortunately, testing ADS morality is nearly\nimpossible due to the absence of universal moral principles.\nTo address this challenge, this paper first extracts a set of\nmoral meta-principles derived from existing moral experiments\nand well-established social science theories, aiming to capture\nwidely recognized and common-sense moral values for ADSs.\nThese meta-principles are then formalized as quantitative moral\nmetamorphic relations, which act as the test oracle. Furthermore,\nwe propose a metamorphic testing framework to systematically\nidentify potential moral issues.

I NTRODUCTION\nAutonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) are a transformative\ninnovation in the automotive industry, aiming to reduce human\nerrors and ease traffic congestion. Despite decades of progress,\nthe complexity and unpredictability of dynamic driving envi-\nronments continue to present significant risks [1]\u2013[5]. Rigor-\nous testing is therefore crucial to uncover and address these\nrisks before large-scale real-world deployment.\nAlthough many testing methods have been proposed, they\nmainly focus on determining whether ADSs violate functional\nproperties, such as collision avoidance [6], [7], obeying traffic\nlaws [8], and reaching the destination [9]. Researchers have\nalso attempted to generate critical scenarios likely to lead to\n\u2217Corresponding author.\nThis work was supported in part by the National Research Foundation,\nSingapore, and DSO National Laboratories under the AI Singapore Pro-\ngramme (AISG Award No: AISG2-GC-2023-008), the NRF Investigator-\nship NRF-NRFI06-2020-0001, the Nanyang Technological University (NTU)-\nDesay SV Research Program under Grant 2018-0980, the National Key\nResearch and Development Program of China under Grant 2022YFC3302600,\nZhejiang Provincial Key Research and Development Program of China under\nGrant 2022C01045, and Science Foundation of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University\n(ZSTU) under Grant 24232204-Y .such violations, utilizing accident reports [11], Large Lan-\nguage Models (LLMs) [12], and guided search techniques [6]\u2013\n[10]. Such functional properties are no doubt important, for\nensuring ADSs successfully finish driving tasks. However,\nevaluating non-functional properties is equally crucial, as these\nproperties ensure that ADS decisions are not only functionally\ncorrect but also robust, comfortable, responsible, interpretable,\nand moral. Therefore, we claim that non-functional testing\nshould be adequately considered.\nAmong the various non-functional properties, morality\nstands out as a critical metric, as it represents the ability\nof ADSs to make ethical decisions [13]. Although safety\nimprovements may significantly reduce injuries and fatalities,\ncrashes will remain unavoidable in some instances, requir-\ning ADSs to make challenging decisions in imminent crash\nscenarios. A typical scenario, as shown in Fig. 1, depicts an\nunavoidable collision situation in which a vehicle cannot stop\nwithin a short distance but still has the option to steer. In\nthis case, the vehicle encounters a moral dilemma [14]: it\nmust choose between continuing straight, which would lead\nto a collision with two pedestrians, or swerving, which would\nplace two passengers in danger. Although these situations\nare low-probability, they are inevitable given the number of\nvehicles on the road. As ADSs become more integrated into\ndaily life, ensuring they act within ethical boundaries becomes\nincreasingly critical.\nIn this paper, we propose a moral testing approach, aimed\nat evaluating the moral decision-making capabilities and un-\ncovering potential moral issues within an ADS. However,\nseveral challenges arise: (1) there are no universal moral\nprinciples [15], which means that different individuals and\ndifferent countries may differ in their ethical preferences.\nFor example, for the passengers in the scenario of Fig. 1,\nprioritizing the protection of their lives should be a moral\nchoice. On the other hand, pedestrians at the zebra crossing\nmay be seen as holding the highest priority, as they are\nfollowing traffic rules. This diversity poses a challenge in\nidentifying universally accepted moral principles; (2) since\nmoral principles are often articulated in natural language and\nare difficult to quantify, this makes it challenging to determinearXiv:2505.03683v1  [cs.SE]  6 May 2025\n\nFig. 1. A moral dilemma scenario faced by ADSs [13].\nwhether ADSs have violated these principles. To address these\nchallenges, we extract a set of moral metamorphic relations\nto capture essential moral values and propose a metamorphic\ntesting framework to automatically generate test scenarios.\nII. A PPROACH\nIn this section, we introduce the extraction and specification\nof moral properties, the description and generation of test\nscenarios, and the detection of moral violations. Specifically,\nthis paper focuses on simulation-based, system-level ADS\ntesting, aiming to evaluate the moral decision-making capacity\nof the entire vehicle controlled by the ADS.\nA. Moral Property Specification\nAccording to existing research [13], [14], [16], there are\nno universally accepted moral principles for ADSs. Since\nmoral principles depend on the cultural background and are\ninfluenced by various factors such as age, education, gen-\nder, income, politics, and religion [13], this poses a serious\nchallenge to the design of test oracle. To address this chal-\nlenge, we propose Moral Meta-Principles , a set of widely\nrecognized, common-sense moral rules intended to ensure that\nADS decision-making aligns with fundamental human values.\nTo establish these principles, we draw from multiple sources\nthat reflect diverse ethical perspectives. First, we reference the\nfindings of the MIT Media Lab\u2019s Moral Machine experiment,\nwhich gathered data on millions of humans\u2019 moral decisions\nfrom individuals across 233 countries and territories [13].\nAdditionally, we incorporate the ethical guidelines set forth by\nthe German Ethics Commission on Automated and Connected\nDriving, which outline key principles for automated ethical\ndecision-making [17]. Further, we consider the theory of basic\nhuman values, which provides a universal model outlining\nbroad values [18], and moral foundations theory, which ex-\nplores fundamental ethical tenets across cultures [19].\nSpecifically, we extract the following principles:\nPrinciple1: ADS should seek equitable treatment fordifferent\nindividuals.Fairness, a core moral value in moral foundations\ntheory [19], centers on the principle of treating every individ-\nual equally. Like other AI-based systems, ADS should upholdfairness in decision-making for all individuals or groups.\nAccording to [17], in unavoidable accident scenarios, any\ndiscrimination based on personal characteristics such as age,\ngender, or physical or mental condition is strictly prohibited.\nRecent studies indicate a significant age bias in existing ADS\nperception models, with children being undetected at a rate\n20.14% higher than adults on average [20]. However, to\nthe best of our knowledge, a comprehensive, system-level\nevaluation of fairness in ADS moral decision-making remains\nunexplored.\nPrinciple2: ADS should prioritizetheprotectionofhuman life\nover theprotection ofother animal life. According to the\nsurvey results of the Moral Machine experiment [13], there\nis a significant difference between sparing humans and pets\n(e.g., cats and dogs), with almost all respondents from different\ncountries showing a strong, nearly universal decision prefer-\nence for prioritizing human lives. Actually, similar statements\ncan also be found in the ethical guidelines established in [17],\nwhich unambiguously states that in unavoidable, life-critical\nsituations, the protection of human life should take precedence\nover the protection of other animal life. It means that harm\nto animals or property is deemed acceptable when necessary\nto prevent personal injury [21]. Hence, testing this metric is\ncrucial for improving user trust in ADSs.\nPrinciple3: ADS should tend tominimize thetotalcasualties\nasmuch aspossible.One of the primary goals of autonomous\ndriving technology is to improve traffic safety by reducing\naccidents and associated losses. Thus, a widely accepted\nguideline for ADS decision-making is to prioritize minimizing\ntotal casualties in potentially fatal scenarios. The findings\nof [13] align with this guideline, showing that participants\nconsistently favored sparing more lives when other factors\nwere equal. Given that some decision-making and planning\nalgorithms already incorporate methods to minimize overall\nmoral risk and reduce the potential number of victims in\naccidents [15], [22], establishing a specialized metric is nec-\nessary for systematically testing and evaluating the moral risk\nassessment capabilities of ADS.\nPrinciple4: ADS should take trafficconditions into account\nwhen makingmoral decision-making. A scenario presented\nin [14] involves a young girl crossing the road at a red light in\nthe straight lane, while an elderly woman crosses at a green\nlight in the swerving lane. Survey results indicate that 86%\nof respondents chose to proceed straight, hitting the girl who\nwas crossing illegally, while only 14% opted to swerve and\ncollide with the law-abiding elderly woman. This suggests\na societal consensus favoring the protection of individuals\nadhering to traffic laws, such as crossing at a green light.\nAccordingly, ADSs should incorporate traffic conditions and\nuser compliance into their moral decision-making processes, as\nprioritizing law-abiding behavior aligns with widely accepted\nethical standards and enhances public trust in autonomous\ndriving technologies.\n\nB. Moral Metamorphic Testing\nInspired by the principles of Metamorphic Testing (MT)\nand its proven effectiveness in detecting bugs, identifying\ndefects, and revealing biases in software and AI models [23],\nwe adopt MT to evaluate the morality of ADSs. MT\u2019s core\nadvantage lies in its ability to verify expected properties\nthrough metamorphic relations without the need for predefined\nground truth. Based on the extracted moral meta-principles\nin Section II-A, we define the following Moral Metamorphic\nRelations (MMRs) .\nFormally, an ADS can be abstracted as a function ADS :\ns\u2192\u03c0, where Sdenotes the space of all possible scenarios.\nThe function takes a scenario s\u2208Sas input and produces\nthe corresponding driving trace observation \u03c0=ADS (s). As\ndescribed in Section II-A, we first expect an ADS to be fair in\ndecision-making, which can be formally defined as an MRR:\n\u2200si, sj, r(si) =r(sj)\u2227p(si)\u0338=p(sj)\u2192\u03c0(si) =\u03c0(sj).\nwhere siandsjare two input scenarios that share the same\nnon-protected attributes (e.g., speed) but differ in sensitive\nprotected attributes (e.g., gender, age, skin tone, height). A\nfair ADS should produce identical outputs for these inputs,\ni.e.,\u03c0(si) =\u03c0(sj). Pairs of siandsjthat fail this MMR are\nreferred to as immoral-revealing test cases (IRTCs) , meaning\nscenarios in which the ADS exhibits immoral behavior.\nForPrinciple2 , it can be formalized as the following MMR:\n\u2200s, c(s) = (hum, pet )\u2192Pr[HUM = 1]< Pr [PET = 1].\nwhere the function c(\u00b7)specifies the type of character in a\nscenario. Specifically, c(s) = ( hum, pet )indicates that both\nhumans and pets are present in scenario s, while HUM = 1\nandPET = 1represent the events where the ADS chooses to\nhit a human and a pet, respectively. The probability of these\nevents occurring is denoted by Pr[\u00b7]. This relation ensures that\nthe probability of the ADS choosing to hit a human is strictly\nlower than that of hitting a pet in such scenarios, reflecting\nthe moral priority of protecting human life.\nFurthermore, for Principle3 , its corresponding MMR can be\ndescribed as:\n\u2200s, l1(s)< l2(s)\u2192Cas(\u03c0(s))\u2264l1(s).\nwhere, for a given scenario s, there are two lanes, and the\nnumbers of humans on these lanes are represented by l1(s)and\nl2(s), respectively. The condition l1(s)< l 2(s)implies that\nthere are more humans in lane 2 than in lane 1. To ensure fair\ntesting, all other attributes (such as age, gender, and skin tone)\nare kept consistent across both lanes. The function Cas(\u00b7)\nrepresents the number of casualties in scenario scaused by the\nADS. This MMR requires the ADS to have risk assessment\ncapabilities, ensuring it chooses the solution that minimizes\noverall harm.\nFinally, let us define the MMR for Principle4 :\n\u2200s, v 1(s) =True\u2227v2(s) =False (1)\n\u2192Pr1[HUM = 1]> Pr 2[HUM = 1].where vk(s) =True means that pedestrians on lane khave\nviolated traffic rules, whereas vk(s) = False ignifies that\npedestrians are abiding by the traffic rules. Prk[HUM = 1]\ndenotes the probability of the ADS colliding with humans\nin lane k. This MMR formally establishes the expectation\nthat when ADS makes ethical decisions, it should account for\npedestrians\u2019 compliance with traffic laws, prioritizing the pro-\ntection of law-abiding pedestrians in unavoidable situations.\nNote that all the above MMRs are designed to system-\natically reveal moral issues and discover diverse IRTCs by\nassessing whether the ADS\u2019s decisions align with ethical\nexpectations when partial attributes in the input scenario are\nmodified. In the following, we describe how to formally\ndescribe and automatically generate test scenarios.\nC. Moral Testing Langauge\nIn this section, we build upon SCENEST [24] to propose\na moral testing language designed to effectively model test\nscenarios. The language has a well-designed structure and\nunified descriptive capability for consistent and comprehensive\nscenario representation. The following presents a test scenario\ndescribed using the proposed language, which includes a\nvehicle and two pedestrians with different genders: male\n(\u201cPresley\u201d) and female (\u201cPamela\u201d). Thus, a key step for\ngenerating a scenario is to instantiate the scenario description\nwith concrete values. Given a scenario s, we first design a\nmutation strategy to generate new scenarios s\u2032by modifying\nthe attribute of p(s),c(s),l(s), and v(s). Then, we check\nwhether the MMRs hold for the outputs of both the original\nand the generated test cases.\nmap_name = \"san_francisco\";\n//Ego vehicle\ncar_model = \"Lincoln MKZ 2017\";\nvehicle_type = (car_model);\nego_init_position = (-228.81, 268.97);\nego_init_state = (ego_init_position);\n...\nego_vehicle = AV(ego_init_state, ..., vehicle_type);\n//Pedestrian1\nped1_model = \"Presley\";\nped1_position = (-249.22, 250.08);\nped1_init_state= (ped1_position, , 1.0);\n...\nped1 = Pedestrian(ped1_init_state, ...);\n//Pedestrian2\nped2_model = \"Pamela\";\nped2_position = (-246.10, 247.71);\nped2_init_state= (ped2_position, , 0.8);\n...\nped2 = Pedestrian(ped2_init_state, ...)\nscenario0 = CreateScenario{load(map_name);\nego_vehicle; {ped1, ped2}; ...};\nIII. I MPLEMENTATION AND DISCUSSION\nImplementation: In this section, we describe the implemen-\ntation of the proposed testing method. Fig. 2 provides a high-\nlevel depiction of our testing framework, designed to discover\nIRTCSs . First, a sampling strategy is employed to select a sub-\nset of scenarios from an existing pool of test cases, forming the\nsource test scenarios. Second, a mutation strategy is applied to\n\nVirtual Testing Source \nScenarios\nMutation\nFollow -up \nScenariosSource \nObservations\nFollow -up \nObservationsOutput \nVerification\nMR CheckerPool of \nMMRsInitial\nScenarioSampling\nIRTCspass\nfail\nADSFig. 2.

Then, both the source and\nfollow-up scenarios are executed on a virtual testing platform,\nwhich returns their respective execution results. Note that the\nvirtual testing platform can be instantiated with any ADS. In\nthis paper, we evaluate the commercial-grade VIRES VTD\nsimulator and its built-in ADS. Following scenario execution,\nan output verification process checks whether any MMRs are\nviolated. If a violation is detected, it is identified as a moral\nissue, and it will add to the set of IRTCSs . Conversely, if the\nMMR is satisfied, the test cases and collected observations\nare utilized to guide further mutations. Finally, the framework\nreturns the discovered IRTCSs , offering valuable insights into\nthe moral decision-making capabilities of the ADS under test.\nResults: Fig. 3(a) shows a test scenario in VTD, where two\npedestrians are on the zebra crossing: an adult female in front\nof the car and a female child in the left lane. To simulate\nan unavoidable collision scenario, we assign the ADS a high\ninitial speed, such as 100 km/h. The results indicate a clear\ntrend where the ADS tends to prioritize protecting the adult,\nwhile the child is more likely to be collided with. In Fig. 3(b), a\ndifferent scenario is tested where a pedestrian and a boar are\nplaced on the zebra crossing. The simulation results reveal\na noteworthy ethical issue: the ADS chose to collide with\nthe pedestrian instead of the boar. This decision suggests that\nthe ADS may not have prioritized the protection of humans,\nraising concerns about its moral decision-making in scenarios\ninvolving animals. More results and simulation videos are\navailable at https://sites.google.com/view/ads-moral-testing/.\nDiscussion: Note that the ADS and the simulator used in this\npaper can be replaced with other instances, such as BaiduApollo ADS with LGSVL simulator. In addition, more moral\nrules can be incorporated as MMRs, as long as they are\nuniversally recognized and widely accepted. This flexibility\nallows the testing framework to evolve and adapt to new moral\nconsiderations that may emerge in the field of autonomous\ndriving. Moreover, as this paper focuses on system-level test-\ning, the identified IRTCs can be used in subsequent root cause\nanalysis processes to locate the specific module responsible\nfor the moral issues. Finally, it is important to note that all\nexperiments in this study were conducted within simulated en-\nvironments, meaning that the experimental process described\nherein does not directly engage with real-world ethical issues.\nIV. C ONCLUSION\nThis paper deviates from conventional evaluation of ADSs\nthat typically focus on safety-related functional requirements.\nInstead, we aim to evaluate the model morality of the decision-\nmaking process in ADSs. As we are about to endow millions\nof vehicles with decision autonomy, serious consideration of\nADS morality has never been more urgent. Therefore, in this\npaper, we propose a metamorphic testing-based framework\nfor testing morality in ADSs with a mutation-based test case\ngeneration strategy. By comparing the executed observations\nof different test cases, the moral issues can be detected using\na set of well-designed moral metamorphic relations.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Y . Huai, Y . Chen, S.

However, the impact of Galactic foregrounds, which has been studied less\nextensively than many other potential systematics, could in principle pose a problem for CMB\nlensing measurements. These foregrounds are inherently non-Gaussian and hence might mimic\nthe characteristic signal that lensing estimators are designed to measure. We present an analysis\nthat quantifies the level of contamination from Galactic dust in lensing measurements, focusing\nparticularly on measurements with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the Simons Observatory.\nWe employ a whole suite of foreground models and study the contamination of lensing measurements\nwith both individual frequency channels and multifrequency combinations. We test the sensitivity of\ndifferent estimators to the level of foreground non-Gaussianity, and the dependence on sky fraction\nand multipole range used. We find that Galactic foregrounds do not present a problem for the\nAtacama Cosmology Telescope experiment (the bias in the inferred CMB lensing power spectrum\namplitude remains below 0.3 \u03c3). For Simons Observatory, not all foreground models remain below\nthis threshold. Although our results are conservative upper limits, they suggest that further work\non characterizing dust biases and determining the impact of mitigation methods is well motivated,\nespecially for the largest sky fractions.\nKeywords: cosmic background radiation \u2013 gravitational lensing \u2013 methods: data analysis \u2013 diffuse radiation.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe cosmic microwave background (CMB) was re-\nleased when the Universe was approximately 380 ,000\nyears old. As CMB photons travel to our observation\npoint, they encounter large-scale structure that gravita-\ntionally deflects their trajectories. This phenomenon is\nknown as weak gravitational lensing of the CMB. A mea-\nsurement of this effect provides an opportunity to map\nthe projected matter density field, probe the growth of\nstructure, constrain the neutrino mass, learn about the\ngeometry of our Universe, or constrain the dark energy\nmodel [1, 2].\nLensing breaks the statistical isotropy of the CMB,\nwhich in turn can be used to reconstruct the lensing de-\nflections using quadratic combinations of the CMB inten-\nsity ( T) and polarization ( E, B) fields [3\u20135]. In partic-\n\u2217ia404@cam.ac.ukular, different quadratic estimators (QEs) provide mea-\nsurements with varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) de-\npending on the experiment\u2019s noise levels. The TTes-\ntimator has the highest SNR for an experiment such as\nPlanck (with noise levels around 30 \u00b5K-arcmin in temper-\nature) [6\u20138]. Moreover, the reconstructed deflection field\nis still dominated by temperature-only information with\ncurrent CMB experiments such as the Atacama Cosmol-\nogy Telescope [ACT, 9\u201312] or the Simons Observatory\n[SO, 13], all with temperature noise levels at least three\ntimes lower than Planck . The EBestimator becomes the\nmost powerful and will dominate the lensing reconstruc-\ntion once experiments reach noise levels well below 5 \u00b5K-\narcmin [4, 14].1Next-generation experiments, including\nCMB Stage IV [17, 18], will most likely not use quadratic\nestimators to reconstruct the lensing field (as they will\n1CMB temperature maps again become the dominant contributor\nto the SNR for a CMB experiment such as CMB-HD [15, 16].arXiv:2505.03737v1  [astro-ph.CO]  6 May 2025\n\n2\nbecome suboptimal), and will instead favor likelihood-\nbased iterative methods [19\u201322] (as recently used by the\nSouth Pole Telescope [SPT, 23, 24]). Nevertheless, QEs\n(and in particular TT) will remain a useful tool to fore-\ncast and cross-check results.\nAlongside lensing, foregrounds are another potential\nsource of statistical anisotropy and non-Gaussianity in\nCMB maps. This is particularly important in tempera-\nture, for which extragalactic foregrounds such as the ther-\nmal Sunyaev-Zel\u2019dovich effect [25, 26] sourced by galaxy\nclusters or the millimeter-wave emission by dusty star-\nforming galaxies [27\u201329] can significantly bias CMB lens-\ning measurements, as multiple studies [e.g. 30\u201335] have\nshown. A common mitigation strategy in this case is\nto use \u201cbias-hardened\u201d quadratic estimators, a modified\nform of the standard QE that has zero response, at lead-\ning order, to the statistical anisotropy caused by these\nsources [30, 36, 37]. In polarization, extragalactic fore-\nground biases are not expected to be significant [38\u201340].\nMoreover, new methods are being developed to further\nminimize their impact [41\u201343].\nGalactic foregrounds, on the other hand, have not been\nstudied to the same extent in the CMB lensing literature\n(with only a few papers discussing the problem, e.g. [44\u2013\n46]). Nevertheless, they are of particular concern for lens-\ning studies because they are highly non-Gaussian, with\ninterstellar medium (ISM) structures correlating different\nscales in a highly anisotropic fashion, and hence could\nmimic the characteristic signal that lensing estimators\nare designed to measure. Thermal dust emission from our\nown Galaxy, in particular, is the most relevant Galactic\nemission mechanism at frequencies above \u03bd\u227370 GHz [see\ne.g. 47\u201350]. In polarization, [44, 45] find using one non-\nGaussian small-scale dust realization that dust produces\nnon-negligible biases, and suggest parametric foreground\ncleaning approaches that successfully mitigate them. [46]\nperforms an approximate estimate of dust biases using a\nsmall high-dust region near the Galactic plane and finds\na 15 % bias in the temperature reconstruction, which is\nreduced to acceptable levels after foreground cleaning;\nthe authors note, however, that some caution is required\nin interpreting this result more broadly since the these\nare specific to the bright dust field they employ.\nCompared to Planck , ground-based experiments have\na reduced frequency coverage which hampers component-\nseparation techniques.2This results in different strate-\ngies to minimize foreground contamination. While\nPlanck used foreground-cleaned CMB maps [7, 8], lensing\nreconstruction from ground-based experiments such as\nACT [12] or SPT [24] only use CMB maps from at most\nthree frequency bands, centered at 90, 150 and 220 GHz.\n2This will soon change with the upcoming Simons Observatory,\noperating on six frequency bands centered around 27, 39, 93,\n145, 225 and 280 GHz [13].These analyses performed a whole suite of null tests that\nensured minimal contamination from extragalactic fore-\ngrounds [e.g. 34]. Since detailed estimates of Galactic\nforeground biases were not available, sky fractions were\nchosen very conservatively, potentially discarding a large\nfraction of usable data. A detailed quantification of the\nlevel of bias on these experiments is hence well motivated.\nIn this work, we focus on the impact of Galactic dust\nnon-Gaussianity on lensing reconstructions performed\nwith quadratic estimators. Estimating the level of bias\nhas been difficult in the past because, as pointed out\nin [46], the dust field on small scales is not well con-\nstrained by current data, especially in polarization and\nat high Galactic latitudes where the dust emission is re-\nduced. When simulating the foreground field, this is-\nsue is usually circumvented by filtering out these scales\nand replacing them with Gaussian realizations of a given\ntarget power spectrum that follows the trend measured\non large scales [see e.g. 51, 52]. However, this solution\ndoes not account correctly for non-Gaussianity on small\nscales. Fortunately, several groups have produced fore-\nground simulations including non-Gaussianities on small\nscales in the last few years. These include magneto-\nhydrodynamic simulations [e.g. 53, 54], phenomenolog-\nical models based on temperature observations using a\nsuperposition of Galactic dust layers [e.g. 55, 56], models\nbuilt from wavelet scattering transform statistics [57\u201359]\nor generative adversarial neural networks [60, 61], dust\nmodels based on neutral hydrogen [62], and filament-\nbased ones [63, 64]. In particular, the PySM software\n[52, 65] provides a suite of models spanning a range of\ncomplexities on the scales where there is little data avail-\nable, hence making it an ideal tool to check for Galactic\nforeground biases in a variety of physical scenarios re-\ngarding the foreground properties. In this work, we will\nuse a whole range of simulations to estimate the bias to\nthe lensing power spectrum due to Galactic foregrounds.\nPrevious studies in the literature have focused on pre-\nvious [66] or longer-term future CMB missions [44\u201346].\nInstead, we will explore the impact it has on lensing from\ncurrent generation experiments, in both temperature and\npolarization, and for a whole suite of dust models.\nThe paper is organized as follows. We present the gen-\neral methodology of lensing reconstruction in \u00a7II, with\na particular focus on the approach taken in this work.\nIn\u00a7III, we present upper limits to the level of Galactic\ndust contamination on CMB lensing reconstruction anal-\nyses and their bias to the lensing amplitude parameter.\nWe conclude in \u00a7IV. We assume the following default\ncosmology: H0= 67 .02 km s\u22121Mpc\u22121, \u2126bh2= 0.0222,\n\u2126ch2= 0.1203.\n\n3\nII. METHODOLOGY\nA. Formalism of lensing reconstruction with\nquadratic estimators\nWeak lensing of the CMB leads to a remapping of the\nobserved CMB sky, which can be expressed to leading\norder in \u03d5as [2, 67]:\nT(\u02c6n) =eT(\u02c6n+\u2207\u03d5(\u02c6n))\u2243eT(\u02c6n) +\u2207eT(\u02c6n)\u00b7 \u2207\u03d5(\u02c6n),(1)\nwhere Tis the lensed temperature field and eTis the\nunlensed temperature field.3The lensing deflection angle\n\u2207\u03d5is expressed in terms of the lensing potential \u03d5, itself\nan integral of the gravitational potential4along the line\nof sight \u02c6n. From the equation above, we see that lensing\nchanges the statistics of the CMB, inducing correlations\nbetween the temperature field and its gradient. When\naveraging over all possible unlensed CMB realizations,\nnon-opposite lmodes in the CMB now become correlated\ndue to a \u03d5(L) lensing mode:\n\u27e8T(l)T(L\u2212l)\u27e9CMB =f(l,L)\u03d5(L),L\u0338= 0,(3)\nwhere f(l,L) is a function that depends on the angu-\nlar power spectrum of the unlensed CMB temperature.5\nThis mode-coupling is a reflection of the fact that lensing\n(with a fixed lensing field) breaks translation invariance\nin the CMB. Quadratic estimators [4] exploit this mode-\ncoupling property to provide an estimate for \u03d5(L):\n\u02c6\u03d5(L) =A\u03d5\nLZd2l\n(2\u03c0)2f(l,L)T(l)T(L\u2212l)\n2Cobs\n\u2113Cobs\n|L\u2212l|, (4)\nwhere Cobs\n\u2113is the observed (lensed) CMB spectrum in-\ncluding noise. The quadratic estimator is normalized as\nfollows:\nA\u03d5\nL=\"Zd2l\n(2\u03c0)2f2(l,L)\n2Cobs\n\u2113Cobs\n|L\u2212l|#\u22121\n. (5)\nIt can be shown that, if run on a map containing all the\nexpected sources of power, A\u03d5\nLis equivalent to the CMB\n3Similar expressions can be derived for the polarization compo-\nnent of the CMB.\n4More precisely, CMB lensing measurements are sensitive to the\nWeyl potential \u03a8 W\u2261(\u03a6 + \u03a8) /2, where \u03a8 and \u03a6 are the tem-\nporal and spatial distortions of the Universe\u2019s geometry,\nds2=a2(\u03c4)\u0002\n\u2212(1 + 2\u03a8) d \u03c42+ (1\u22122\u03a6) d x2\u0003\n. (2)\nThe so-called anisotropic stress describes the difference between\nthe time distortion and the spatial distortion of the metric. This\nis usually assumed to be negligible, in which case we have \u03a8 W=\n\u03a8 = \u03a6.\n5In practice, we use the lensed gradient power spectra CX\u2207Y\n\u2113\nforX, Y =T, E, B to reduce higher-order corrections needed to\nmatch the non-perturbative result [68, 69].lensing power spectrum reconstruction noise, also known\nas the N(0)\nLbias [3, 70, 71, see also \u00a7A]. Below, we will\nperform lensing reconstruction on simulated foreground-\nonly maps, in order to estimate the resulting bias to the\nlensing power spectrum. In doing this, we implicitly as-\nsume that the dust and lensed CMB maps are entirely\nindependent, such that we only need to compute the dust\ntrispectrum to estimate the biases to our lensing spec-\ntrum measurement. In this case, the foreground-only\nmap has power Cfg\n\u2113, rather than Cobs\n\u2113. In this case, the\nN(0)\nLbias takes the form [34]:\nN(0)\nL=\u0000\nA\u03d5\nL\u00012Zd2l\n(2\u03c0)2f2(l,L)Cfg\n\u2113Cfg\n|L\u2212l|\n2\u0010\nCobs\n\u2113Cobs\n|L\u2212l|\u00112. (6)\nThis result is derived explicitly in \u00a7A. Finally, we note\nthat one can work equivalently with the lensing potential\n\u03d5or the convergence \u03ba. They are related by:\n\u03ba(\u02c6n) =\u2212\u22072\u03d5(\u02c6n)/2. (7)\nFrom Poisson\u2019s equation, \u03bameasures the projected frac-\ntional matter overdensity, instead of the projected grav-\nitational potential traced by \u03d5.

In practice, we\nuse curved-sky calculations as implemented in falafel .6\nSimilarly, lensing deflections can be reconstructed not\nonly from the CMB temperature field, but also using\ndifferent quadratic combinations of the CMB intensity\n(T) and polarization ( E,B). These can be combined\ninto a minimum variance MV estimator [5] to improve\nthe signal-to-noise ratio. When only polarization-derived\nmeasurements are used, the minimum-variance estimator\nis denoted MVPol. We use tempura7to compute the\nnormalizations of all estimators and perform lensing re-\nconstructions with so-lenspipe .8\nB. Experimental setup\nWe explore the impact of Galactic dust on lensing\nreconstruction for two different experimental configura-\ntions. Firstly, we focus on an ACT-like experiment, com-\nprising two frequency bands centered at 90 and 150 GHz.\n6https://github.com/simonsobs/falafel\n7https://github.com/simonsobs/tempura\n8https://github.com/simonsobs/so-lenspipe\n\n4\nThe footprint for such analysis is constructed by inter-\nsecting the ACT footprint with Planck masks,9and fur-\nther removing regions with clearly visible Galactic dust\nclouds, as described in [12]. Planck masks are labeled as\nXX%, where XX denotes their sky fraction (in percent).\nThe resulting masks are ACT + Planck 60 %, ACT +\nPlanck 70 % and ACT + Planck 80 %. For short, we\nrefer to them as ACT 60 %, ACT 70 % and ACT 80 %.\nThey have effective sky fractions fsky= 0.28,fsky= 0.31,\nandfsky= 0.34, respectively, after apodizing the edges\non 3\u25e6scales with a cosine profile. These are shown in the\ntop panel of Figure 1.\nWe take the Simons Observatory experiment, as de-\nscribed in [13], as the second experimental setup that we\nexplore. We assume six SO frequency bandpasses, cen-\ntered around 27 and 39 GHz (low-frequency bands, LF),\n93 and 145 GHz (mid-frequency bands, MF), and 225 and\n280 GHz (ultra-high-frequency bands, UHF). We focus\non the Large Aperture Telescope (LAT) survey of SO.\nSimilar to ACT, we construct three Galactic masks for\nthis configuration by intersecting the SO-LAT footprint10\nwith Planck 60 %, 70 % and 80 % masks and further re-\nmoving the regions flagged by ACT [12]. Their edges are\nalso apodized on 3\u25e6scales with a cosine profile, and the\nresulting sky fractions are fsky= 0.37,fsky= 0.42 and\nfsky= 0.47, respectively. The masks are shown in the\nbottom panel of Figure 1. Similar to the labeling used\nfor ACT masks, we refer to SO masks (for short) as SO\n60 %, SO 70 % and SO 80 %.\nIn this work, for the purposes of filtering and normaliz-\ning the quadratic estimator as above (equation 4), we will\nmake the simplifying assumption that the total power in\nthe maps can be expressed as\nCobs\n\u2113=C\u2113+ \u22062e\u2113(\u2113+1)\u03c32\nFWHM /8 ln 2, (9)\nwhere C\u2113is the theoretical lensed power spectrum (com-\nputed using camb [72]). \u2206 is the white-noise level of\nthe ground-based experiment. We consider two different\nwhite-noise levels. In temperature, \u2206 T= 12 \u00b5KCMB-\narcmin (ACT-like) or \u2206 T= 6\u00b5KCMB-arcmin (SO-like).\nBoth have angular resolution \u03c3FWHM = 1.4\u2032. In polariza-\ntion, we assume that the white-noise levels are a factor\u221a\n2 larger than in temperature.11\n9HFIMask GalPlane-apo0 2048 R2.00.fits , available on the\nPlanck Legacy Archive ( https://pla.esac.esa.int/ ).

Non-Gaussian Galactic sky model\nBefore summarizing the foreground models used in\nthis work, we will introduce the common empirical rela-\ntions employed to describe the Galactic dust component.\nThese same relations are used when simulating the dust\nfield. We work in thermodynamic temperature units,\n\u00b5KCMB, for which spectral energy distribution (SED) of\nthe CMB as function of frequency \u03bdis a constant by def-\ninition:\nSCMB\n\u03bd = 1. (10)\nThe SED of thermal dust emission ( d) is often modeled\nas a modified black-body spectrum [see e.g. 49]:\nSd\n\u03bd=g(x\u03bdd\n0)\ng(x\u03bd)\u0012\u03bd\n\u03bdd\n0\u0013\u03b2dB\u03bd(\u0398d)\nB\u03bdd\n0(\u0398d), (11)\nwhere \u03b2dis the dust spectral index, \u03bdd\n0= 353 GHz is\nthe pivot frequency, and B\u03bd(\u0398) is the Planck black-\nbody spectrum, which expresses the spectral radiance of\na black-body for frequency \u03bdat temperature \u0398:\nB\u03bd(\u0398) =2h\u03bd3\nc2\u0014\nexp\u0012h\u03bd\nk\u0398\u0013\n\u22121\u0015\u22121\n, (12)\nand where kand hare the Boltzmann and Planck\nconstants, respectively. g(x\u03bd) is the conversion fac-\ntor between Rayleigh-Jeans brightness temperature units\n(commonly used for foregrounds) and thermodynamic\ntemperature units [74]:\ng(x\u03bd) =ex\u0012x\nex\u22121\u00132\n, x =h\u03bd\nk\u0398CMB, (13)\nwhere \u0398 CMB = 2.7255 K is the CMB temperature [75].\nRegardless of the exact values that \u0398 dand\u03b2dtake\nwithin the different dust models, a simple evaluation of\nequation (11) yields that dust intensity at 150 GHz is\n\u223c3 times brighter than in the 90 GHz channel. As a\nresult, we expect biases in the lensing reconstruction to\nbe almost 2 orders of magnitude larger in the 150 GHz\nchannel than in the 90 GHz one, since we are working\nwith a four-point function of the dust amplitude.\nEmpirically, the dust ( d) auto-spectrum is often\nparametrized as a power-law:\n\u2113(\u2113+ 1)\n2\u03c0Cdd\n\u2113=Ad\u0012\u2113\n\u21130\u0013\u03b1d\n, (14)\nwhere Adis the amplitude, \u03b1dthe tilt, and \u21130= 80\nthe pivot scale.

Differ-\nent models then have different strategies to generate the\n(non-Gaussian) small-scales, which we now describe:13\n\u2022PySM d9. PySM models are based on Planck dust\ntemplates [49, 84, 85], which are constructed using\nthe Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combina-\ntion (GNILC) algorithm [86].

The dust amplitudes on\nlarge scales follow Planck data [50, 84] and the\nspectral parameters are generated randomly within\neach layer [56].\n\u2022dustfilaments15[64, 87]. Galactic dust exhibits\na filamentary structure that cannot be reproduced\nfrom random Gaussian statistics. These filaments\n15https://github.com/chervias/DustFilaments\n\n6\nhave been observed at millimeter wavelengths by\nPlanck [e.g. 88, 89], among others, and also found\nto be traced by Galactic neutral hydrogen emission\n[62, 90\u201392]. Filaments and their misalignment with\nrespect to the Galactic magnetic field can quantita-\ntively reproduce the properties of Galactic dust as\nobserved by Planck at 353 GHz [50, 63, 93]. Based\non this idea, dustfilaments constructs a full-sky\nsimulation of the Galactic dust at millimeter fre-\nquencies by integrating the emission of millions of\nfilaments in a predefined volume. By construction,\nthe filament population is calibrated to match the\ndust power-spectrum on the SO-LAT footprint that\nintersects with Planck 80% Galactic mask, as de-\nscribed in [64, 87], with spectral parameters derived\nfrom the GNILC best-fit \u03b2dand \u0398 dmaps [84].\n\u2022Vansyngel d1[55].

In temperature, there is a loss of power above\n\u2113\u223c1000 due to the presence of a 30\u2032FWHM beam.\nAs a result, the biases derived from this model will\nbe slightly optimistic. This model also introduces\nEBcorrelations in the dust field at the level com-\npatible with existing data [93].\nFor illustrative purposes, Figure 2 shows 10 \u00d7\n10 deg2zoomed-in regions centered at (RA, DEC) =\n(\u221242\u25e6,\u22125\u25e6) for PySM d9,dustfilaments and Vansyn-\ngeld1dust emission models (in arbitrary units). They\nall trace the Planck GNILC map [84] (upper left corner)\non the largest scales, and include small-scale features un-\nresolved with current data. In Figure 3, we present the\ntemperature power spectra at 93 GHz for the whole va-\nriety of dust models used in this work. These are com-\nputed on the SO 70 % mask. Even though all models are\ncalibrated using 353 GHz Planck data at the pivot scale\n\u21130= 80, we see a spread at the level of 0 .4 dex in power.\nThis is due to both differences in the sky footprint used\nto calibrate their models and the spectral energy distri-\nbution assumed to extrapolate between frequencies. In\naddition, the PySM models are calibrated primarily with\nthePlanck GNILC dust template [84, 85], while dust-\nfilaments is calibrated with the spectra of the 353 GHz\nPlanck NPIPE maps (with the best-fit CMB subtracted).\nThe latter case has more power, which could originate\nfrom the cosmic infrared background (CIB), as evidenced\nby figure 4 of [65]. We do not correct for these differences\nwhen reporting the biases that different models produce.\nAs described earlier, Galactic foregrounds are domi-\nnated by dust emission at frequencies above \u03bd\u227370 GHz\n[see e.g. 48].

The TTestimator only of-\nfers moderate gain going from an ACT-like experiment (with\na white noise level of 12 \u00b5KCMB-arcmin) to an SO-like one\n(6\u00b5KCMB-arcmin). The vast majority of the improvement\ncomes from estimators making use of polarization channels,\nsuch as EB. As a result, for a given frequency channel, any\nincrease in foreground bias in temperature-only reconstruc-\ntions will be primarily driven by the wider area accessed by\nSO in comparison to ACT.\nchannels. We consider PySM [65] models s4,s5ands7.\nThese offer varying levels of complexity regarding the\nmodeling of small scales in terms both of amplitude and\nspectral parameters. They can be combined with PySM\nd9,d10andd12, respectively. We follow the PySM con-\nvention and denote d9s4,d10s5 andd12s7 as the PySM\nlow,medium andhigh complexity models. Vansyngel+17\n[55] also provides a synchrotron realization, produced in\na similar procedure as the one used for dust. We denote\nthe sum of those dust and synchrotron simulations as\nVansyngel d1s1.\nD. Estimation of foreground biases on lensing\nreconstruction measurements\nWe run the different quadratic estimators on\nforeground-only maps and measure the autospectrum of\nthe resulting lensing reconstructions. The resulting mea-\nsurement is C\u02c6\u03d5\u02c6\u03d5,fg\nL. We treat the foreground-only maps\nin the same way as CMB maps. In particular, we filter\nthe maps (both in temperature and polarization) with\nthe 2-point power defined in equation (9), which does\nnot include the power sourced by the Galactic foreground\nfield. We do this to mimic a real lensing analysis, where\nGalactic foregrounds are typically not included when con-\nstructing the filters. This does not cause a significant loss\nof optimality, since the level of dust power predicted by\nthe sky models we use is below the experiment\u2019s observedsignal and noise power for all relevant multipoles in the\nanalysis.\nBecause it includes reconstruction noise power, C\u02c6\u03d5\u02c6\u03d5,fg\nL\nconstitutes an upper limit to the bias that Galactic non-\nGaussian foregrounds pose to CMB lensing reconstruc-\ntion measurements. In particular, current analyses fur-\nther remove the well-known lensing power spectrum bi-\nases, including the N(0)\nLandN(1)\nLbiases; our results are\nupper limits because we do not subtract any of those\nbiases in our baseline analysis. We investigated differ-\nent avenues to subtract the dominant N(0)\nLbias but con-\ncluded that we cannot trust our ability to remove it reli-\nably in our estimates (see Appendix B for more details).\nHence, in the main text we present upper bounds on the\nbias produced on the CMB lensing power spectrum am-\nplitude, and, as such, the maximum impact that Galactic\nforegrounds could produce in our lensing analyses. We\nfollow [12, 34] and employ the statistic \u2206 Alensto quantify\nthe bias in the inferred lensing power spectrum amplitude\nAlensdue to the presence of Galactic foregrounds:\n\u2206Alens=P\nL\u03c3\u22122\nLC\u02c6\u03d5\u02c6\u03d5,fg\nLC\u03d5\u03d5\nL\nP\nL\u0010\nC\u03d5\u03d5\nL/\u03c3L\u00112, (15)\nwhere we assume a fiducial lensing power spectrum signal\nC\u03d5\u03d5\nLcomputed in the default cosmology and a diagonal\ncovariance matrix (with elements \u03c3L) representing the\nerror bars of an actual lensing measurement.\nSince the uncertainty on Alens is given by\u0012P\nL\u0010\nC\u03d5\u03d5\nL/\u03c3L\u00112\u0013\u22121/2\n, we can also report the bias as\na fractional error:\n\u2206Alens\n\u03c3(Alens)=P\nL\u03c3\u22122\nLC\u02c6\u03d5\u02c6\u03d5,fg\nLC\u03d5\u03d5\nLr\nP\nL\u0010\nC\u03d5\u03d5\nL/\u03c3L\u00112. (16)\nSince the variance of the estimator is given by the nor-\nmalization, we will approximate the noise on our lensing\nbandpowers as\nN\u03ba\u03ba\nL=A\u03d5\nL\u0012L(L+ 1)\n2\u00132\n, (17)\nand we will use the Knox formula [94\u201396] to compute the\ndiagonal covariance:\n\u03c32\nL=2\n(2L+ 1) \u2206 Lfsky(C\u03ba\u03ba\nL+N\u03ba\u03ba\nL)2, (18)\nwhere \u2206 Lis the width of the bandpowers used and\nC\u03ba\u03ba\nLis our fiducial CMB lensing power spectrum. For\nACT, this approach leads to an underestimation of\n\u03c3(Alens), predicting overly optimistic SNRs ( \u223c90)\nthat have not been achieved in practice, due to vari-\nous reasons including filtering and noise anisotropies.\n\n8\nWe therefore introduce a common fudge factor of\n1.3 to all our analytical predictions of \u03c3(Alens) for\nACT to recover the SNR values ( \u223c70) measured in\npractice. For SO, this empirical degradation factor\nis not necessary as \u03c3(Alens) is in line with previous\nforecasts. We use the binning and L-range from the\nlatest ACT lensing analysis [12]: 13 bins distributed\nwithin the range 40 < L < 1300 with bin edges L=\n[40,66,101,145,199,264,339,426,526,638,763,902,1100,\n1300].\nIn Figure 4, we show the fiducial CMB lensing power\nspectrum (solid black) compared to the lensing recon-\nstruction noise levels corresponding to different estima-\ntors. As discussed in \u00a7I, we see that the TTestimator\nonly offers moderate gain going from an ACT-like exper-\niment to an SO-like one, since the CMB temperature is\nalready signal dominated on the relevant scales. Conse-\nquently, for a given frequency channel, any increase in\nforeground bias in temperature-only reconstructions will\nbe primarily driven to the wider area accessed by SO in\ncomparison to ACT. The vast majority of the improve-\nment comes from estimators making use of polarization\nchannels, such as EB.\nIII. RESULTS\nA. Temperature-only reconstruction\nIn Figure 5, we show the results of running the TT\nquadratic estimator on different non-Gaussian dust fore-\nground models, and as a function of sky fraction. The\ntop panel corresponds to ACT-like footprints and noise\nlevels, whereas the bottom panel refers to SO-like ones.\nWe also show the fiducial CMB lensing power spectrum\nfor reference as a solid black line. These curves present\nan upper bound on dust contamination. We have not\nsubtracted any known biases, and hence their shape at\nlowLis contaminated by the mean-field bias produced\nby the mask. On scales much smaller than the ones\nshown in these Figures, we see the characteristic shape\nproduced by the N(0)\nLbias. An explanation of these is\npresented in Figure 13 (Appendix A). It is not straight-\nforward to estimate and subtract those biases because,\non the one hand, the two-point power spectrum used to\ncompute the analytical N(0)\nLbias is not representative\nof the local two-point power spectrum across the map.\nOn the other hand, we do not have enough realizations\nof the dust field for the different models to estimate the\nmean-field. In Appendix B, we explore a possible strat-\negy based on a patch-by-patch reconstruction, which has\npreviously been proposed in [36, 46].\nThe white regions in Figure 5 correspond to the scales\nused in [12] to derive cosmological parameters, namely\n40< L < 1300, and hence the scales on which we com-\npute the upper limit to the bias \u2206 Alenson the lensingpower spectrum amplitude Alens. We report these in\nFigure 6, in terms of the measurement uncertainty on\nAlens. On the 70% masks, \u03c3(Alens) is 0 .016 (ACT) and\n0.009 (SO). In these Figures 5\u20136, we focus on two differ-\nent mid-frequency channels where the CMB is brightest.\nSince the dust intensity at 150 GHz is \u223c3 times brighter\nthan in the 90 GHz channel (see \u00a7II C), we see that the\nbiases in the lensing reconstruction are almost 2 orders\nof magnitude larger in the 150 GHz channel than in the\n90 GHz one.16Finally, we perform lensing reconstruction\non different footprints. As expected, the biases increase\nwith sky fraction since we are accessing regions closer to\nthe Galactic plane, where Galactic foreground emission\ndominates. At 90 GHz, we find that the shift induced\nonAlensremains below 0 .3\u03c3for ACT (limit marked as\na vertical dashed gray line in Figure 6). It is well below\nthe 0.5\u03c3level for SO (limit marked as a thick gray line in\nFigure 5), except for when using the 80% mask for which\nbiases become non-negligible. As a result (unless there\nare further improvements to our conservative upper lim-\nits in future work), we advise against using Planck 80 %\ndust mask for CMB lensing reconstruction analyses.\n1. Mitigation strategies: profile hardening\nA common mitigation strategy of extragalactic fore-\ngrounds in CMB lensing analyses is the use of bias-\nhardened quadratic estimators. This is a geometric\nmethod that modifies the form of the standard QE\nsuch that, at leading order, it has zero response to\nthe statistical anisotropy caused by these foregrounds\n[30, 36, 37, 42]. In particular, [12, 34] use a tSZ-like\nprofile to bias-harden against tSZ clusters, although the\nmethod performs well in the presence of other fore-\ngrounds with different profiles, such as the CIB [42].\nWe test whether the tSZ-profile-hardened \u201csource\u201d ( s)\nestimator also successfully mitigates non-Gaussian dust\nforegrounds. Since the Galactic dust distribution con-\ntains both source-like clumps and a large-scale mask-like\nmodulation in its amplitude, we might expect harden-\ning approaches, which reduce the impact of both point\nsources and mask effects, to reduce the level of dust bias.\nIn the presence of this foreground, equation (3) be-\ncomes:\n\u27e8TlTL\u2212l\u27e9=f\u03d5\nl,L\u03d5L+fs\nl,LsL, (19)\nwhere the average is taken at fixed lensing and source\nfield.

For reference, we also show the\nfiducial CMB lensing powers spectrum (black line), and mark as a thick gray line the level of foreground that would produce a\n0.5\u03c3shift on the inferred CMB lensing power spectrum amplitude, which varies depending on the experimental configuration\nand the estimator used. The white regions correspond to the scales usually used to derive cosmological parameters, namely\n40< L < 1300. The SED of dust is such that biases in the lensing reconstruction are almost 2 orders of magnitude larger in\nthe 150 GHz channel (right column) than in the 90 GHz one (left column). Biases also increase as a function of sky fraction,\ndenoted with different line styles. The top (bottom) four panels correspond to results with an experimental setup similar to\nACT (SO).

On\neach set, we show as different colors the results for differ-\nent sky fractions (60%: yellow, 70%: pink, 80%: blue). The\nhatched bars correspond to results obtained on the same set-\nting but with profile-hardening (PH) added as a mitigation\nstrategy. This helps in all models except on dustfilaments .\nFor reference, with profile hardening, the uncertainty on Alens\non the 70% masks is 0 .019 (ACT) and 0 .011 (SO). We find\nthat the shift induced on Alensremains well below 0 .3\u03c3(ver-\ntical dashed line) for ACT, and also for SO when excluding\nthe 80% mask. We show results at 90 GHz. At 150 GHz, the\nbiases are in all cases almost a hundred times larger.\nwhere \u02c6 sLis an estimator for the source field, constructed\nfollowing the same procedure as that for the lensing field\n\u03d5L, andR\u03d5s\nLis the response function [36]:\nRa,b\nL\u223cAa\nLZ\nd2lfa(l,L)fb(l,L), (21)\nwhich we define to absorb the normalization of the esti-\nmator. There is a moderate noise cost for bias hardening\n(BH), where the noise in the reconstruction (c.f. equation\n17) now takes the form [30, 34, 36, 37]:\nN\u03ba\u03ba,BH\nL =N\u03ba\u03ba\nL\u0000\n1\u2212N\u03ba\u03ba\nLNss\nLR2\nL\u0001\u22121, (22)\nwhere RLis the response of the estimator to the presence\nof the foreground we harden against and Nss\nLis the noise\nof the source estimator. With profile hardening, our es-\ntimate of \u03c3(Alens) increases by 20 %: 0 .019 (ACT) and\n0.011 (SO).\nThe results are shown in the panels labeled as \u201cwithPH\u201d in Figure 5. We also quote the bias in the lens-\ning amplitude as hatched bars in Figure 6. We find that\nprofile-hardening helps reduce the amplitude of the bias\non the PySM and Vansyngel+17 models, although the\nimprovement is not very large. This result is somewhat\nsurprising since the bias produced by dust \u201cblobs\u201d should\nbe absorbed by profile hardening, as noted earlier. We\nfind the improvement to be mainly driven by a suppres-\nsion of the power spectrum amplitude at low L, usually\nenhanced by the presence of a mask. We can see this\nexplicitly by computing the expected value of the bias-\nhardening source estimator:\n\u27e8\u03d5BH,s\nL\u27e9=1\n1\u2212 R\u03d5s\nLRs\u03d5\nL\u0010\n\u27e8\u02c6\u03d5L\u27e9 \u2212 R\u03d5s\nL\u27e8\u02c6sL\u27e9\u0011\n, (23)\nin the presence of both foreground sand a mask w(\u02c6n),\nthat is:\n\u27e8TlTL\u2212l\u27e9=f\u03d5\nl,L\u03d5L+fs\nl,LsL+fM\nl,LML, (24)\nwhere we have introduced the complementary function\nof the mask in Fourier space, M\u2113=\u03b4\u2113\u2212W\u2113[36]. We\nintroduce (24) in (4) and substitute in (23). Making use\nof (21), we find:\n\u27e8\u03d5BH,s\nL\u27e9=\u03d5L+R\u03d5M\nL\u2212 R\u03d5s\nLRsM\nL\n1\u2212 R\u03d5s\nLRs\u03d5\nLML. (25)\nThat is, the prefactor quantifying the contribution to the\nbias due to the presence of a mask (originally R\u03d5M\nL) has\nnow been reduced. This reduction is proportional to how\nsimilarly the two fields respond to the presence of \u03d5. In\nthe limit s\u223cM,RsM\nL= 1, and the contribution from the\nmask is completely suppressed. We compute explicitly\nthe ratio of this new prefactor obtained when we bias-\nharden against point sources with respect to the original\nresponse R\u03d5M\nL. The reduction is typically 20%, with val-\nues ranging from 30% at L\u223c10 to 10% at L\u223c1000.\nThis idea is now linked to the fact that both PySM and\nVansyngel+17 models rely on modulating small scales\nby a large-scale field t(\u02c6n) to generate non-Gaussianities.\nThis operation can straightforwardly be absorbed by the\npresence of a mask \u02dc w(\u02c6n) =w(\u02c6n)t(\u02c6n). Therefore, using\nprofile-hardening will also mitigate against biases arising\nfrom this new mask ( M\u2113now becomes \u02dcM\u2113=\u03b4\u2113\u2212\u02dcW\u2113\nin the discussion above). dustfilaments do not syn-\nthesize small scales following the modulation approach.\nWe can speculate that since dusfilaments neither looks\nlike a mask modulation nor looks like individual sources,\ninstead appearing as very elongated structures (as can be\nseen in Figure 2), profile hardening has minimal impact.\nIn order to decrease the bias at all multipoles, new\nprofiles based on the foreground\u2019s bispectrum and power\nspectrum [37] are needed. For example, these could be\nchosen to reflect the typical size of filaments or dust\nclumps. We leave this line of research to future work.\n\n11\n10\u22121210\u22121010\u2212810\u22126L2(L+ 1)2C\u03c6\u03c6\nL/2\u03c0\nACT,90 GHz\n ACT,150 GHz\n101102103\nL10\u22121210\u22121010\u2212810\u22126L2(L+ 1)2C\u03c6\u03c6\nL/2\u03c0\nSO,93 GHz\n101102103\nL\nSO,145 GHz\ndustfilaments\nPySMhighVansyngel d1s1\nTTMVPol\nEB\nFIG. 7.

On PySM and dustfilaments\nmaps, estimators that make use of polarization measurements are less biased, whereas Vansyngel d1s1 model presents a higher\nbias in polarization than in temperature. At 150 GHz, the biases show similar trends than at 90 GHz but are almost a hundred\ntimes larger, as was discussed in \u00a7III A.\nB. Galactic foreground biases in both intensity and\npolarization\nAs CMB experiments reach higher sensitivities, polar-\nization measurements will contribute to the majority of\nSNR in lensing analyses [24, 97] and quadratic estimators\nwill become suboptimal [19\u201322]. The improvements from\noptimal methods applied to experiments such as ACT or\nSO are very modest. We do expect, however, polariza-\ntion measurements to contribute significantly to the re-\nconstruction SNR, especially for SO. As a result, we now\nexplore the impact of non-Gaussian Galactic foregrounds\nin both intensity and polarization within the framework\nof quadratic estimators. We now include synchrotron\nwithin our foreground modeling (PySM low,medium and\nhigh complexity models, as discussed in \u00a7II C), eventhough its contribution on frequencies above 70 GHz is\nnegligible. We further check that synchrotron produces\nno shift in the CMB lensing power spectrum bias on those\nchannels.\nIn Figure 7, we show upper limits to the CMB lens-\ning power spectrum bias as a function of the estimator\nused. The top panel shows results for ACT channels on\nthe ACT 70 % footprint ( fsky= 0.31), and the bottom\npanel corresponds to the SO mid-frequency channels on\nthe SO 70 % footprint ( fsky= 0.43). We only include the\nmost complex PySM model (PySM high), together with\ndustfilaments and Vansyngel d1s1 for clarity. Firstly,\nwe find that on PySM and dustfilaments maps, esti-\nmators that make use of polarization measurements are\nless biased. This is in agreement with previous works\n[46], and it is not a result of the lack of EBcorrelation\n\n12\n101102103\nL10\u22121110\u2212910\u2212710\u22125L2(L+ 1)2C\u03c6\u03c6\nL/2\u03c0\n/lscriptmin(EB)\n10 400 600\n101102103\nL\n/lscriptmax (TT)\n3000 3300 3500\nPySMd9\nPySMd10PySMd12\ndustfilamentsVansyngel d1\nFIG. 8. Upper limit on the raw lensing power spectrum due to non-Gaussian dust foregrounds in an experiment such as SO\n(70 % mask, fsky= 0.42) at 93 GHz, as a function of the multipole range used in the reconstruction, for TTandEBestimators.\nLeft: As\u2113minis varied (fixed \u2113max= 3000), the EBestimator presents significant shifts in the amplitude of the bias because it\nhas important contributions from low- \u2113modes. Right : Increasing \u2113max(while keeping \u2113min= 600 fixed) in the temperature-only\nestimator also leads to an increase in the bias, although the shifts are small.\npresent on these models. Any non-zero EBsignal cannot\nproduce a mean-field bias in the EBestimator. However,\nit could generate some non-zero bias at the trispectrum\nlevel, as pointed out by [45]. We show in Appendix D\nthat the level of EBcorrelations compatible with exist-\ning data are too small to have any detectable contribution\nto the trispectrum.\nFinally, we also find that Vansyngel+17 models present\na higher bias in polarization than in temperature. We\nbelieve this is due to the loss of power above \u2113\u223c\n1000 present in these simulations, which we explore fur-\nther in the next section ( \u00a7III B 1). In a nutshell, the\ntemperature-only estimator receives most of its contri-\nbution from high multipoles [98], but there is no signal\non those small scales on this model.\nPrevious papers have found that the biases present in\npolarization due to non-Gaussian dust foregrounds can\nbe mitigated well below the experiment\u2019s requirements\nafter including the dust power spectrum in the filters\nfor the CMB fields (equation 9). This strategy did not\nwork for the temperature-only estimator since the CMB\ncomponent dominates the temperature power spectrum\nCMB [45, 46]. We are in the same position here. The\nlevel of dust predicted by the sky models we use is below\nthe experiment\u2019s observed signal (including noise) for all\nrelevant multipoles in the analysis, so including it does\nnot serve as a mitigation strategy.1. Mitigation strategies: choice of multipole range used in\nthe reconstruction\nWe follow [44, 45] and show the sensitivity of the bias\nto changing the multipole range used in the lensing recon-\nstruction. We explore changes in both \u2113minand\u2113maxwith\nrespect to the default analysis range, 600 < \u2113 < 3000\n[12]. In particular, Galactic foreground biases are known\nto worsen when decreasing the minimum multipole.\nWe show in Figure 8 the upper limit of dust foreground\nbiases in the SO-like experiment (70 % mask) configura-\ntion.

Inverse-variance weights used to combine ACT 90\nand 150 GHz channels in temperature. They are derived from\nthe actual ACT noise power spectra [99], and are normalized\nto unity at every multipole \u2113. Similar weights are computed\nto combine the polarization ( E,B) components. The 90 GHz\nchannel provides the largest contribution to the coadded map.\ntion for the TTestimator, or the maximum multipole for\ntheEBestimator, so these are not shown.\nThese results can be explained as follows: the contri-\nbution of CMB multipoles \u2113\u2272700 to the signal-to-noise\nratio of the lensing reconstruction in temperature is very\nsmall [98], so we only see appreciable changes when we\nvary the maximum multipole instead. On the smallest\nscales, however, Galactic foregrounds become subdom-\ninant and produce a minimal change if included. The\nEBestimator, on the other hand, has significant contri-\nbutions from lower \u2113[100], the scales at which Galactic\nforegrounds become more important.\nSimilar behavior was found in [44], who suggest low-\n\u2113filtering as a useful robustness check for the effect of\ndiffuse foreground biases. As a general guidance, CMB\nlensing analyses should always ensure the consistency of\ndifferent scale cuts.\nIn this section, we have stressed how high- \u2113multipoles\ncontribute the most to the signal-to-noise in temperature-\nonly reconstructions [98]. These scales, however, are not\npresent in the Vansyngel+17 model due to the presence\nof a 30\u2032beam. If this was not the case, we would expect\nthis model to present a larger bias in temperature than\nin polarization, as it is the case for the other sky models\nexplored in this paper. This is apparent in Figure 8: both\nsolid lines in the two plots correspond to the same multi-\npole range used in the reconstruction (600 < \u2113 < 3000),\nand we see that TTpresents a larger bias in temperature\nthan in polarization in all models except the Vansyn-\ngel+17 one.

They are\ncomputed directly from the data covariance, encoding all\nauto- and cross-spectra (including the lensed TTCMB spec-\ntra, thermal and kinetic SZ effects, CIB and radio point source\nemission [13]). For clarity, we smooth the resulting weights\nbefore plotting them. Similar weights are computed to com-\nbine the polarization ( E,B) components. The mid-frequency\nchannels provide the dominant contribution to the HILC map.\nminimum variance estimators are slightly optimistic.\nC. Biases on coadded frequency channels\nIn practice, CMB lensing measurements are not per-\nformed on individual frequency maps. The first step is\noften to combine the data gathered by the experiment at\nthe different frequencies into a single CMB map. This has\nseveral advantages, including foreground mitigation. We\nnow discuss biases measured on coadded frequency chan-\nnels. This method is similar to the foreground-cleaning\napproaches discussed in [44\u201346], which were found to sig-\nnificantly help reduce Galactic foreground biases.\nFor the ACT-like experiment, we perform an inverse-\nvariance coaddition of the foreground maps at the differ-\nent frequencies (\u201cfcoadd\u201d). We follow the same proce-\ndure as in ACT [12] to combine the maps from both 90\nand 150 GHz frequency channels into a single \u201ccoadded\u201d\nmap dcoadd\n\u2113m.

The weights for the EandB\ncomponents are derived from the same procedure, and\nfollow the same trend: the 90 GHz channel provides the\nlargest contribution to the coadded map.\nIn the case of the SO-like experiment, we perform a\nHarmonic Internal Linear Combination [HILC, e.g. 86,\n101\u2013103], similar to equation (26) where the weights are\nnow computed directly from the data covariance C(a\n6\u00d76 matrix encoding the auto- and cross-power spectra\nat the SO frequencies):\nw=1\u22a4C\u22121\n1\u22a4C\u221211, (27)where both wand1are six-dimensional vectors (each\nentry corresponding to a different frequency channel)18.\nThe resulting weights ware shown in Figure 10.

We run the\nestimators on coadded frequency channels (inverse-variance weighted for ACT, harmonic internal linear combination for SO).\nLeft: Reconstruction performed with the minimum variance MV estimator. We show the bias as a function of sky fraction\n(60%: yellow, 70%: pink, 80%: blue). The hatched bars correspond to results obtained on the same setting but with profile-\nhardening (PH) added as a mitigation strategy. Within the ACT 70 % mask, the shift in Alenslies is below 0 .3\u03c3. For SO,\nhowever, it is unclear whether the bias remains at those levels, as not all models lie within this range. Right : Upper limit\nto the bias as a function of the temperature or polarization channels used: both (MV) in yellow, temperature-only ( TT) in\npink and polarization-only (MVPol) in blue. We use the 70% mask for this test. In general, we find much larger biases in\ntemperature-only reconstructions in comparison to those using polarization channels.\ncasting [13], and discussed in detail in the aforementioned\npaper. As a summary, they include lensed TTCMB spec-\ntra, thermal and kinetic SZ effects, CIB and radio point\nsource emission, in addition to synchrotron, free-free and\nanomalous microwave emission from Planck Commander\nmodels [104] and thermal dust emission maps (\u201cmodel 8\u201d\n[105] in Sehgal et al. 2010 [106] simulations). In polariza-\ntion, we add to the lensed CMB mock power spectra that\ninclude SO-like noise19and Galactic foreground emission.\nWe measure the power spectra of PySM d9ands4mod-\nels at 353 and 23 GHz, respectively. We extrapolate to\nthe different SO channels using a modified black body\nspectrum for dust ( \u03b2d= 1.59, \u0398 d= 19.6; [47]) and a sim-\nple black-body distribution for synchrotron ( \u03b2s=\u22123.00;\n[49, 107, 108]). As expected, we find that the weights are\nsuch that SO mid-frequency channels provide the domi-\nnant contribution to the HILC map across all multipoles.\nWe present the results (with and without profile hard-\nening) in Figure 11. These correspond to reconstructions\n19Generated using https://github.com/simonsobs/V3_calc .performed with the minimum-variance (MV) estimator.\nWe report the resulting upper limits to the bias on the\nCMB power spectrum amplitude Alensin Figure 12 (left\npanel). We find that within the ACT 70 % mask, the\nshift in Alenslies below 0 .3\u03c3(dashed-gray vertical line).\nFor SO, however, it is unclear whether the bias remains\nat those levels, as not all models lie within this range\nwhen the SO 70 % mask is used. Finally, we find that ex-\ntending the CMB analysis footprint to the Planck 80 %\ndust mask is potentially too risky if no further mitigation\nstrategies are in place.\nIn Figure 12 (right panel), we also quantify the bias\non the lensing power spectrum amplitude for other esti-\nmators. We find that temperature-only reconstructions\ncontinue suffering from Galactic foreground biases. For\nACT, this is expected as we are now including (although\nsmall, see Figure 9) contributions from the 150 GHz chan-\nnel. For SO, we see that the HILC method performs very\nwell for the PySM low-complexity model. We believe this\ndue to the fact that the spectral parameters on this model\nremain uniform across the sky. The absence of decorre-\nlation and the use of six frequency channels makes the\nHILC method ideal to remove the non-Gaussian Galac-\n\n16\ntic contamination. However, we find larger biases with\nmore complex models (reaching the 3 \u03c3level for Van-\nsyngel d1s1). Additional foreground complexity, in ad-\ndition to the fact that SO HILC relies much more on\nthe 150 GHz frequency channel (see Figure 10), is pos-\nsibly the origin of these larger biases in comparison to\nthe results obtained in \u00a7III A. In polarization, biases are\nsmaller than in temperature. Therefore, quadratic esti-\nmators making use of polarization channels will be more\nrobust against these biases. However, as we reach even\nlower noise levels and make use of iterative estimators,\nit is unclear what the impact of non-Gaussian Galactic\nforegrounds will be, and therefore future work is needed.\nAs mentioned earlier, the results presented here con-\nstitute an upper limit to the contamination produced by\nnon-Gaussian Galactic foregrounds since we do not re-\nmove any of the expected lensing power spectrum biases.\nIn Appendix B, we explore a possible strategy to remove\nthe well-known mean-field and Gaussian biases. The ap-\nproach is based on a patch-by-patch reconstruction, and\nhad previously been proposed in [36, 46]. However, we\nfind this avenue unsuccessful and therefore choose not to\ninclude it when deriving our main results.\nOn the other hand, current analyses make use of the\nrealization-dependent N(0)\nLalgorithm (RDN0; [7, 36]),\nwhich is insensitive to errors in the power spectra of the\nsimulations used to compute this bias to first order in the\nfractional error. This algorithm is known to reduce off-\ndiagonal Lcorrelations. In Appendix C, we test whether\nit is successful at mitigating unaccounted non-Gaussian\nGalactic foreground biases with a connected 4-point func-\ntion. In summary, we find that bias subtraction does not\nappear to qualitatively change the conclusions from our\nsimpler upper limit, with the caveat that those results are\nnot fully converged due to limited simulation availability.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nWeak gravitational lensing of the CMB is a mature ob-\nservable for precision cosmology. However, a particular\nconcern for CMB lensing studies might be Galactic fore-\ngrounds. These are inherently non-Gaussian and hence\nmight mimic the characteristic signal that lensing esti-\nmators are designed to measure [45, 46]. As a result, any\nunknown bias in the inferred lensing power spectrum am-\nplitude can directly impact cosmological inferences.\nIn this work, we presented an analysis that quanti-\nfies the impact of Galactic dust non-Gaussianity on lens-\ning reconstructions performed with quadratic estimators\nin both temperature and polarization on the Atacama\nCosmology Telescope (two frequency bands centered at\n90 and 150 GHz with a white noise level of 12 \u00b5KCMB-\narcmin in temperature) and Simons Observatory (6 fre-\nquency channels and 6 \u00b5KCMB-arcmin white-noise levelin temperature) experiments.\nWe applied the relevant quadratic estimators to a com-\nprehensive suite of foreground simulations. The result-\ning measurement of the lensing power spectrum C\u02c6\u03d5\u02c6\u03d5,fg\nL\nconstitutes an upper limit to the bias that Galactic non-\nGaussian foregrounds pose to CMB lensing reconstruc-\ntion measurements, and we used it to compute the bias\non the inferred lensing power spectrum amplitude Alens.\nThe dust SED is such that we found biases in the lensing\nreconstruction almost 2 orders of magnitude larger in the\n150 GHz channel than in the 90 GHz one.\nIn general, we found polarization measurements to\npresent smaller biases than temperature ones. We also\nfound, in line with previous works, that \u2113minis the most\nsensitive to the presence of Galactic foregrounds, and rec-\nommend that all analyses continue ensuring consistency\nof different scale cuts. Biases also increased with sky\nfraction, and, although our results are conservative upper\nlimits, to be cautious we advise against using a Planck\n80% dust mask for CMB lensing reconstruction analyses\nwithout any further mitigation strategy in place.\nAfter coadding the two frequency channels, and within\nthe 70 % mask region, Galactic foregrounds do not\npresent a problem for the ACT experiment (the shift in\nAlensremains below 0.3 \u03c3). In SO, not all foreground\nmodels remain below this threshold after performing a\nHILC. Although our results are conservative upper lim-\nits, the wider area accessed by SO, together with the\nlarger weight on the 150 GHz channel, suggest that fur-\nther work on characterizing dust biases and determining\nthe impact of mitigation methods is well motivated, es-\npecially for the largest sky fractions.\nThe non-Gaussian nature of Galactic foregrounds\nposes a challenge to upcoming CMB lensing analyses.\nThis is relevant not only for precision cosmology with\nthe CMB lensing power spectrum, but it also impacts\nother probes such as the detection of inflationary B-\nmodes [109, 110] or post-Born lensing curl B-modes\n[111, 112]. This work was an early analysis to quan-\ntify the level of contamination from Galactic emission on\ncurrent ground-based CMB experiments, and motivates\nfurther investigation to develop mitigation strategies for\nthis foreground. In particular, ongoing work is study-\ning the impact of component separation methods that\nuse positional information, such as wavelets or needlets\n[see e.g. 113, 114], on the Galactic foreground problem\nfor lensing. In addition, synergies with upcoming space\ntelescopes such as the LiteBIRD satellite [115, 116] will\nbetter inform our component separation strategy.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Toshiya Namikawa and Anthony Challi-\nnor for helpful input and discussions, Zach Atkins for\n\n17\nproviding the core code to plot masks in CAR projec-\ntion.

Lensing breaks translation invariance in the\nCMB. As described in the main text, when averaging over\nall possible unlensed CMB realizations, different modes\nin the CMB now become correlated due to lensing (equa-\ntion 3). That expression suggests the following estimator\nfor\u03d5(L):\n\u02c6\u03d5(L)\u223cT(l)T(L\u2212l)\nf(l,L), (A1)\nwhere we can combine all different pairs of modes apply-\ning inverse-variance weighting:21\n\u02c6\u03d5(L) =A\u03d5\nLZd2l\n(2\u03c0)21\nVar\u0010\nT(l)T(L\u2212l)\nf(l,L)\u0011T(l)T(L\u2212l)\nf(l,L),\n(A2)\nwhere A\u03d5\nLis inversely proportional to the total sum of\ninverse-variance weights,\nA\u03d5\nL=\uf8ee\n\uf8f0Zd2l\n(2\u03c0)21\nVar\u0010\nT(l)T(L\u2212l)\nf(l,L)\u0011\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\u22121\n.

Substituting this expression in equations\n(A2), (A3), we obtain equations (4) and (5), respectively.\nWhen the temperature fields are combined using\ninverse-variance weights computed from the total power\nin the temperature map, as it is the case in equation\n(4), the weights are so-called optimal. However, if those\nsame weights, or filters, are used on a different temper-\nature map (e.g. a foreground map), those weights will\nno longer be optimal. In that case, the variance of the\n21Given a set of measurements {\u02c6Xi}, they can be combined into\na single estimate for Xas\u02c6X=P\niwi\u02c6Xi.

Pedagogical introduction to CMB lensing biases.\nWe run the TTquadratic estimator on a masked Gaussian\n(unlensed) field.

(A6)\nThe normalization of the quadratic estimator is equiv-\nalent to the lensing power spectrum reconstruction noise.\nThis is clear when running the lensing reconstruction on\na Gaussian field. In this case, no lensing signal should be\npresent. The output of the reconstruction is simply the\nreconstruction noise, sourced by the disconnected four-\npoint function of the field. This is pictured in Figure\n13, where we run the temperature quadratic estimator\non a Gaussian field generated from a given power spec-\ntrum. The measured signal (solid blue) perfectly agrees\nwith the analytical expectation for the N(0)\nLbias (dashed\ngreen) at high L. At low L, there is the so-called mean-\nfield bias, which is due to the mask. The mask is a source\nof statistical anisotropy, present even in the absence of\nlensing. This is picked up by the quadratic estimator. In\norder to remove this contribution, we run the estimator\n22This problem is equivalent to computing Var( \u02c6X),\nVar( \u02c6X) = Var \nAX\niwi\u02c6Xi!\n=A2X\niw2\niVar( \u02c6Xi) (A5)\nwhere wiare derived from the total (observed) CMB map (equa-\ntion A4), whereas Var( \u02c6Xi) is proportional to the total foreground\npower.\n\n22\n101102103\nL10\u22121310\u22121210\u22121110\u22121010\u2212910\u22128L2(L+ 1)2C\u03c6\u03c6\nL/2\u03c0\nPySM d9\n101102103\nL\nPySM d12\n101102103\nL\ndustfilaments\nsignal \u02c6\u03c6LM\u2212/angbracketleft\u02c6\u03c6LM/angbracketright N(0)\nL\nFIG. 14. Lensing reconstruction performed on different dust models, where we divide the footprint in different 50 deg2patches,\nperform the lensing reconstruction locally, and then sum over different patches. With this approach, we can estimate the\nmean-field and N(0)\nLbias (dashed orange line), although with varying levels of success. The results here correspond to the\n90 GHz ACT channel on the ACT 60% mask, for the temperature-only estimator including profile hardening.\non several masked Gaussian simulations with the same\npower spectrum as our fiducial map, and take the aver-\nage\u27e8\u02c6\u03d5LM\u27e9. We remove the mean-field bias \u27e8\u02c6\u03d5LM\u27e9from\nthe reconstructed \u02c6\u03d5LMbefore taking the power spectrum.\nThe result is shown as the solid orange line in Figure 13.\nWith this correction, the reconstructed signal agrees with\nthe Gaussian bias on all scales.\nAppendix B: Local lensing reconstructions\nTo fully capture the impact of non-Gaussian dust on\nlensing spectrum measurements, the steps of mean field\nsubtraction and realization-dependent bias subtraction\nwould need to be simulated accurately. However, this\nis challenging because to accurately capture these steps,\nCMB signal and instrument noise would need to be added\nto the dust simulations, which would make it difficult\nto obtain converged estimates of very small dust biases.\nDespite these challenges, we will attempt this approach\nin the next appendix.\nIn this appendix, however, we aim to obtain a sim-\nple, approximate (and more converged) estimate of the\nimpact of mean-field and N(0)\nLbias subtraction. Note\nthat simply using the mean dust two-point function in\nthe map to compute these mean-field and bias terms\nis not sufficient, since this does not capture position-\ndependence in the dust power; correspondingly, we find\nthat this approach underestimates the bias present in the\nreconstruction for all models beyond a simple Gaussian\ndust field.\nThe results provided in the main text correspond to\nupper limits to the total bias on the CMB lensing power\nspectrum amplitude due to the presence of non-Gaussian\nGalactic foregrounds. We found that the bias should liebelow percent level. We confirm this result by running\nthe full ACT lensing pipeline on two different simula-\ntions, which include a non-Gaussian dust realization from\ndustfilaments [64] and PySM d12, respectively, using\nthe MV estimator.\nA possible workaround is to divide the footprint in dif-\nferent patches, perform the lensing reconstruction locally,\nand then sum over all different patches [36, 46]. This is\nan approximation to the performance of the realization-\ndependent bias subtraction algorithm, making our re-\nsults less conservative (and perhaps overly optimistic)\nwhen compared with the ones presented in the main text.\nWith this approach, the two-point function within each\npatch will represent the power within each patch more\nclosely. We perform this exercise for the profile-hardened\ntemperature-only estimator at 90 GHz on the ACT 60%\nmask and noise levels. We choose individual patches of\narea 50 deg2.\nIn Figure 14, we show our estimate for the N(0)\nLbias\ncomputed this way (following equation A6) for three dif-\nferent models (dashed lines). We compare this to the\npower spectrum of the reconstructed \u02c6\u03d5LM, where we have\npreviously removed an estimate of the mean-field bias\nwithin each patch following the approach described in\nAppendix A (solid lines). We find that this approach is\nthe most successful with the dustfilaments model. For\nPySM d9, the N(0)\nLbias is slightly overestimated, which\nleads to a negative lensing power spectrum at high L.\nIn the case of PySM d12, the N(0)\nLbias is greatly un-\nderestimated. We believe this is due to the presence of\nlocalized dust blobs in some patches, which makes the 2-\npoint function not representative of the power across the\npatch even for a reduced sky area. These results are also\ncaptured in Table I, where we derive upper limits to the\nshift induced on the lensing power spectrum amplitude\n\n23\nTABLE I. Upper limit to the bias of the lensing power spec-\ntrum amplitude for different dust models in a configuration\nsimilar to the ACT experiment in the 60% mask for the\n90 GHz channel. We report results obtained for the TTes-\ntimator with profile hardening. We compare performing the\nreconstruction locally and then summing over the different\npatches (\u201cpatches\u201d) versus simply performing the reconstruc-\ntion on the full footprint without any bias subtraction (\u201cfull-\nsky\u201d). The former allows to compute estimates for the mean-\nfield and N(0)\nLbiases, which we subtract. In general, this\napproach allows for a reduction of the bias but it is not per-\nfect, as can be seen in the accompanying Figure 14.\n100\u00d7\u2206Alens Patches Full-sky\nPySM d9 0.002 (0.001 \u03c3) 0.003 (0.002 \u03c3)\nPySM d12 0.084 (0.054 \u03c3) 0.081 (0.053 \u03c3)\ndustfil . 0.067 (0.043 \u03c3) 0.120 (0.078 \u03c3)\nwith this approach. In the next section, we bypass the\naforementioned issues by performing the full reconstruc-\ntion (including bias subtraction) with the machinery of\nmodern lensing analyses.\nAppendix C: RDN0\nWe show the reconstructed bandpowers in the top\npanel of Figure 15. Note that both simulations include\na map-based realistic noise realization computed with\nmnms [99], and the reconstruction is done employing the\ncross-correlation-based quadratic estimator [121] which\nis immune to noise bias. Moreover, we subtract all rel-\nevant biases following the same procedure as [12]. This\nincludes the realization-dependent N(0)\nLalgorithm, which\nabsorbs small changes in the data due to the presence of\ndust. We estimate the lensing amplitude parameter Alens\nby fitting the measured bandpowers to the baseline cos-\nmology prediction.

The absence of EBcorrelation on PySM models [65]\nis not the cause for ACT/SO experiments to be less sensitive\nto non-Gaussian Galactic foreground biases in polarization.\nHere we show the difference in the reconstruction on dust-\nfilaments [64] simulations that include and do not include\nEBcorrelations [87], for a SO-like configuration at 93 GHz\non the SO 70% mask. We find that the level of EBcorre-\nlations compatible with existing data are too small to have\nany detectable contribution to the trispectrum. The small\ndifferences seen in temperature are due to the way these sim-\nulations are constructed.Appendix D: Lensing reconstruction is not sensitive\ntoEBpower spectra\nIn Figure 16, we see that estimators that make use of\npolarization measurements are less biased. This is not a\nresult of the lack of EBcorrelation present on these mod-\nels. Any non-zero EBsignal cannot produce a mean-field\nbias in the EBestimator. However, it could generate\nsome non-zero bias at the trispectrum level, as pointed\nout by [45]. In Figure 16, we show that the level of EB\ncorrelations compatible with existing data are too small\nto have any detectable contribution to the trispectrum.\nWe run the quadratic estimator on two sets of dust-\nfilaments simulations, one of which includes EBcor-\nrelations [87] at the level compatible with existing data\n[50, 93]. We only find differences in the temperature-\nonly reconstructions (that are then propagated into the\nMV estimator). This is due to small differences in the\ntemperature component of the two simulations, present\nin order to achieve the non-zero parity-violating corre-\nlation: the orientation of the filaments with respect to\nthe underlying magnetic field is manipulated, rendering\npopulations of filaments with different orientations and\ntherefore slightly different temperature fields [87].\n\n",
