    "data": "everyone knows the software engineering\njob market is more competitive than ever\nover the past couple of years we've seen\nmassive layoffs everywhere from the tech\ngiants like Microsoft and Google to much\nsmaller companies everyone's been\nimpacted I mean I've just been laid off\nmyself I'm afraid we're going to have to\nlet you go juniors are now competing\nwith experienced Engineers Outsourcing\nis increasing and AI is impacting\neverything so does this mean it's game\nover should we all just in the towel and\nstart flipping burgers at the local Mack\nD's well not exactly in this video I'm\ngoing to break down the challenges\nsoftware engine is face today while they\nstill hope for the future and talk about\nhow you can actually thrive in this\nrabidly evolving Market let's try that\nagain and talk about how you can\nactually thrive in this rapidly evolving\nMarket let's get started now the\nsoftware engineering job market has been\nthrough a hell of a lot in the past few\nyears in 2023 alone I think it's\nsomething like over 300 ,000 Tech\nworkers were laid off and by 2024\nanother 130,000 jobs were cut of course\nevery time another layoff happens the\nmarket gets flooded with more and more\nTalent creating this vicious death\nspiral the effect is particularly being\nfelt by Junior Engineers as they now\nhave to compete with sometimes quite\nfrankly desperate midlevel and Senior\nEngineers who also need a job on top of\nthat companies are increasingly\nOutsourcing jobs to lower cost regions\nlike that in the America India and\nEastern Europe this shift is making it\neven harder to secure opportunities in\ntraditional markets and then of course\nthere's AI the elephant in the room we\nall know that AI tools are automating\nroutine coding tasks at an unprecedented\nPace but look here's the thing\nregardless of AI or not back in 2021 the\nindustry was in an unsustainable boom I\neven heard of Engineers juggling\nmultiple high-paying jobs and grinding\nleak code just to keep jumping companies\nfor a quick pay bump the fact is it just\ncouldn't last forever and now we're in\nthe inevitable downturn I mean think of\nother high-paying professions like\ndoctors or lawyers it takes years of\nlearning and training and overcoming\nbarriers to become highly paid in those\nfields but anyway regardless of that\nremember that after every bubble comes\nstabilization while many will inevitably\nleave the industry and average salaries\nwill adjust this is actually good news\nfor those of us committed to the long\nterm remember that these Cycles have\nhappened over and over and over again in\nthe tech job market and this time will\nbe no different in fact I think there\nare actually a lot of reasons to be very\npositive on the tech Market as we head\ninto 2025 first as absolutely brutal as\nit's been we're well into the tech\nlayoff cycle now layoffs peaked in 2023\nwith huge numbers of jobs lost and while\n2024 did see more Cuts they've been\nslowing down month by month historically\nthese Cycles simply have to bot out and\nstabilize at some point and this time\nwill be no different I firmly believe\nthat the market will recover it's just a\nmatter of when fair enough it might not\nlook like it did before but jobs will\nstill be there second let's talk about\nai's impact AI is obviously helping\ncompanies produce a lot of code very\nquickly but the fact is that the code\nbeing churned out isn't anywhere near\nproduction ready it needs to be reviewed\ntested maintained and improved and that\nrequires skilled developers maintenance\nof code is typically much harder than\ndevelopment itself and AI is just not\nsuited to this yet once companies put\ncode out into production and start\ncharging money for it they have a\nresponsibility to keep it working if\nthey want to continue making said money\nand that will require developers finally\nyou've just got to glance at the news to\nsee that tech companies using Ai and\nrelated Technologies are raising huge\namounts of money right now what does\nthat money go toward sure some of it\ngoes to infrastructure rure and\nmarketing and providing nice lunches for\nclients but the huge majority of it is\nspent on hiring new talent and keeping\nthat Talent Happy companies still need\nstaff and they still need developers now\nthat we've talked about the challenges\nand reasons to stay optimistic let's get\ninto the most important part of the\nvideo what you can do to stand out and\nthrive in the tech job market in 2025\nbecause while the market is competitive\nthere are clear steps you can take to\nposition yourself for success\nfirst you simply must start thinking of\nyourself as a business if you're lucky\nenough to already have an employer start\nthinking of them as your main client\nwith all the tools and AI at your\ndisposal today you have more power than\never to create value you simply must use\nit whether it's automating tasks solving\ntough problems or delivering results\nfaster you need to show that you're\nindispensable but simply if you don't\nleverage these tools someone else will\nsecond improve your own skills not just\nyour coding skills but also problem\nsolving system design even soft skills\nlike communication and teamwork it's not\nenough to be good enough anymore you\nneed to actually get good at what you do\nwhether that means getting I don't know\na kubernetes certification or mastering\nCloud architecture or whatever you're\ninto invest in yourself now so that when\nthe market picks up again you'll be\nahead of the curve next and I know some\nof you won't want to hear this but you\nhave to network more look I get it I'm a\nmassive introvert and I hate talking to\npeople in real life most of the time but\nwhether we like it or not 50% of jobs\nget filled before they're even posted\nthese days people love working with\npeople they already know and trust and\nso being one of these people you'll\nalways have the upper hand if you're\njust relying on platforms like LinkedIn\nwhere you can easy apply with just one\nclick guess what it's just as easy for\neveryone else to do that too in fact it\nwould be pretty trivial to write a\nscript that will apply for a thousand of\nthese jobs networking gives you an edge\nand it's the only way you'll find these\nhidden opportunities before anyone else\ndoes and finally and perhaps most\nimportantly start building your personal\nbrand if there's one thing that\nGenerations Z has taught me is that\nstanding out is more important than ever\nI don't care if it's writing blog posts\ncreating YouTube videos or sharing your\nprojects on social media putting\nyourself out there will open doors you\ndidn't even know existed I can\npersonally testify to this this is\nexactly what I've been doing the last\nfew years even before I got laid off\nsharing more about my own projects and\nprogress online my goal is to encourage\nand Inspire others while building my own\nbrand along the way look I truly believe\nwe're heading increasingly towards\nself-entrepreneurship in Tech with the\nright skills you won't need a company as\na middleman anymore clients will hire\nyou directly as a contractor for\nshort-term projects allowing both sides\nto avoid long-term commitments the\nbottom line is this you have more tools\nand opportunities at your fingertips\nthan ever before but it's up to you to\nuse them think like a business sharpen\nyour skills Network effectively and\nshare your journey with the world these\nare the steps that will set you apart in\n2025 as we wrap up this video I want you\nto remember one thing software\nengineering still offers incredible\nbenefits location Freedom work life\nbalance High salaries the chance to work\non call cool and interesting projects\nand a variety of opportunities yes the\nindustry is evolving the way we find\njobs and even the way we work is\nchanging likely in ways we can't even\nimagine yet but here's the good news if\nyou're committed to this field you too\nhave the power to evolve right along\nwith it I hope you found this video\nhelpful let me know in the comments\nbelow what your predictions are for the\ntech Market in 2025 and what steps\nyou're planning to take for your future\nif you found this helpful

    "data": "Hey everyone, my name is Heidi.\nI recruit Product Managers and I am super\npumped to be chatting today\nwith my friend Handika\nHandoko. I'm going to\nlet him introduce himself\nbecause I want you to hear\nhis story today. So, Handika\ntell us about where you work, what\nyou do and what you're solving for today.\nThanks very much Heidi\nfor considering me and actually taking\nthe time to have a chat with me.\nLike Heidi said, Heidi\nand I go quite way back from a professional\nrelationship first and then kind of moving on to\na more personal relationship as\na friend now. So my name is, Handika.\nI currently work as a Vice\nPresident of Software Engineering for\nBroadridge Financial solutions - it's a global\nfintech leader. I work\nfor a Canadian business unit where\nwe cater to Canadian\nindependent brokerage. So\nthink of the solution that we're doing\nas a brokerage in a box. So\nif you ever in your lifetime want\nto, hey, maybe it's cool to open up a brokerage\nfirm, you come to us and we'll set you up with everything\nthat you need from front to back\nend. Well, I'm talking\nin tech tech lingo, but I feel\nlike from front office to back office\na from a brokerage operations perspective.\nSo that's kind of what my title\nand what I'm doing and where I'm working at.\nCurrently, I'm focused on\nthings that is\nwhat everyone else in the space\nis focusing on. Kind of modernizing our tech\nstack while at the same time trying\nto keep lights on, making sure that\nour clients are able to service\ntheir clients, their investors to\nreach their life goals. So that's\nkind of what we're trying to do in our day to\nday in our work.\nReally mission critical, you know\nenterprise software.\nOne of the reasons\nI was so excited to chat with you today\nis because you have a fascinating\ncareer where,\nyou have been a very successful\nproduct management leader.\nYou were in product for\nthe majority of your career and\nthen you made the decision\nto pivot into engineering\nand so much of what we do in our product\npractice is working\nwith Product Managers also working with\nengineering leaders as well.\nAnd there's such an interesting relationship\nbetween these two critical\nfunctions of a software vendor. I'm\ncurious what led you to making\nthe decision to move out\nof product and into\nan engineering role?\nSo for my case, I think\nthat's not a very complicated\nanswer Heidi. If\nyou look at my my career I did start\nas a Developer, I did\nstart as a Programmer. So I've got my roots\nin programming and I've always had the\nthinkering for technology. I've always\nkept myself up to date with advancements\nin technologies like advances\nin Blockchain. I'm trying to dabble\nin crypto space, advancements\nin AI. So, those are just\nfascinating things and I think people\nin the product space, they're most\nlikely familiar with that venn diagram where as a product\nperson you got that intersection\nbetween knowing the business, knowing the technology\nand knowing the UX - knowing the customer\nexperience. right? So it's all so\nintertwined with each other and\nonce you're in the product space or the technology\nspace - the\nlines do get blurred at some time.\nAnd so for me I think I have the advantage\nand the benefit of knowing about\nthe space, knowing about the technology, knowing\nabout the business. So I'm more\neasily adaptable and when\nthe opportunity comes and shows up\nwhich in life it is\nrare opportunity.\nIt came I feel like I could do\na big contribution\nin the department. I could deliver value in\nthat. That's why I made the jump back\nto my roots if you will, into\ntechnology.\nYou sort of hinted there a little bit about\nhow your career as a Product Manager\nreally helps your career\nnow as a Vice President of Engineering.\nMaybe expand on that a little bit more. How do you\nfind product management skills\ntranslate into being a more effective\nVice President of Engineering?\nYeah absolutely. I think in the product\nmanagement space you're definitely exposed\nmore into the business side of things.\nI like to think of all of\nus in the workspace are really working towards\nsolving a big puzzle.\nThe more different roles that you've\nbeen in the space, in the organization,\nthe better idea of a puzzle\nthat you're trying to solve\nMy knowledge in product management\nI think really helped me to look\nat things from a business/ revenue/ client\nexperience side of things. Like on the\ntechnology side of things back\nthen, like it was, oh, shiny new\ntechnology, let's go at it, let's\ngive it a try, let's do it. And I think\nwe still do that, we still experiment,\nwe still innovate that way. But in terms\nof\nmaking it go-to-market,\nthat's when I think,\nthe things that you learn from product management,\nproduct marketing really comes into play.\nLike, do we have a competitive\nedge there? What is the value prop we're trying to deliver?\nWhat is the problem we're trying to solve?\nI think that being\nin product for so long, that's been ingrained\nin me that that's always the things\nthat I ask whenever we try to do things\nand also helps with\ntechnology right now when I hear from\nmy people, hey, there's this new technology\nthat we want to try this is\nsomething cool that we want to play\nwith. I can associate that with\nwhat clients have been saying, what the market's been\nsaying, what the business needs. And I could more easily\ntie them back, hey, we want to\nachieve this goal for our clients, for our business\nand this is the technology that we think\ncan support that or would be the most\nefficient solution to achieve that. So I think\nthat's kind of like how I would say\nit has helped me, it helps me complete the picture,\nit helps me to see the bigger picture\nAnd I could kind of put every little\npieces if you will, and make\nthe perfect solution.\nVery well said, I I love that.\nIt gives you the chance to really see that bigger picture,\nwhich is so critical when you're, when you're a business\nleader as you are now as a Vice President of Engineering.\nA lot is\nsaid and talked about regarding the relationship\nand what a healthy relationship might look\nlike between a product org and an engineering\norg. I think back to some of\nthe searches that we've had, where\nour clients will tell us, hey,\nthis has largely been an engineering\nled business and we're\ntrying to move\nit closer towards being product-led\nor some other stakeholders might\njoke around and say, oh the\nengineers, it's all about them and they're\nbuilding whatever they want.\nThat product is trying to\nmove that towards\nwhat the customer wants and what\nwhat can be monetized.\nHow do you define the\nhealthy... a healthy relationship\nbetween engineering and product? What\ndoes that look like? How might one\nmove closer towards healthy relationships?\nI think you gotta start with respect.\nI think each side needs to respect\nwhat they bring to the table. I know again,\nlike going back to that venn diagram, I think everyone\nin this space be, you're more technology\ncentric or more product centric, they\noftentimes they have similar skill sets,\nsimilar background. So one\nmight think that they know more\nthan the other. But then\nwe've got our own swim\nlanes to be kind of like...\nhow to make this happen.\nSo, I think that mutual respect\nis really crucial to\na healthy relationship.\nA firm, a startup\nlike you said, may start from an engineering\ncentric kind of position because\nthat is what\nhelped them cement their position\nin the market. They built something\nthat solves the problem and then as\nthey grow, they do\nneed that product management rigor\nif you will, in terms of trying\nto build a project, building that product\nnow, not building a project.\nTrying to build something that address\na larger market, address\na segment that actually\nyou build it once and you serve\na lot of people or you solve a lot of problems\nmultiple times. That's kind of like\nwhat product is there\nto do in terms of rigor. So I think\ntechnology and product again, they\ngotta have that mutual respect. They got\nto understand that, yes, the\nguy that's leading technology\nmay come from a product background. So\nthey may say things about product, but again\nwe've got the dedicated product and likewise,\nthe product person may come\nfrom an engineering background and they may think, oh, this\none's easy, you just do that. Because\nof that, I think that's where things\nget a little bit unhealthy, where you say that\nI could do whatever you are\ndoing more easily. So that's where things\nbreak down I find. So appreciate\nrespect and appreciate what each other\nhas to say and kind of marching towards\nthe same goal. We are all working towards\nsolving problems, delivering value,\nmaking sure that our customers\nor users have a delightful experience.\nI love how\nyou summarized what you just said and\nhow you phrased it - tell me if I got\nthis right - build it once\nand then solve for many people\nover time.\nYes, exactly\nBeautiful.\nIf you think about\nVice Presidents of Product\nand that persona\nof individual in a software company,\nwhat might they not understand\nabout the role of\na VP of Engineering\nand\nperhaps the struggle or\nthe challenges that you're facing\nthat might benefit them to to have some\nvisibility into?\nYeah. So I was\nthinking about that and I think one of the\nchallenges I think\nI face is that, in my\nday to day dealings, I deal\nwith all of my engineers\nwho have aspirations,\nwho wants to make sure\nthey're not getting obsolete from a tech\nperspective, like in terms of\nwhat we use and what they want to learn.\nI have to find\nthat delicate balance between making\nsure that they're happy, they're growing,\nthey're learning what they want. First is meeting\nthe business needs, which typically comes\nfrom product, that we need to build it this way,\nor we need to build in this technology\nkind of thing that helps answer\nwhatever client needs. So sometimes\nthose demands comes from. Sometimes\nthat becomes a point\nof friction between us and saying\nmy set of people here. Yes, I know\nthey have this technology\nunder their belt.\nThey know about this but they want to start\nto learn about new things. They want to start to\nlearn about new technology. So, I'd like\nto invite you to maybe take\na risk and let's try this out.\nThen maybe we embrace a little bit of an agile\nmethodology where let's give\nit a try, if it doesn't work, let's fail fast and\nand pivot. So I think that's\nthe part that maybe...\nnot to say that the leaders\nof product are heartless and they don't care about people.\nThey do but they just I think they're closer\nto different aspects of the business and that's where\ntheir interests are but for me, my\nheart and my interest is always with my people\nand making sure that they're as happy as they can,\nso they can unleash their potential. And\nthat's where the friction comes, to\nbalance, making sure they\nthey get what they need vesus\nwhat we need to deliver to our clients.\nBeautiful.\nLet's end with some advice.\nLet's think about\nthe Product Manager in the market today\nor the the product leader\nwho at this\ntime in the market, there's so much hype\naround getting into product. It feels like everyone's,\ntaking courses and classes and workshops\nand they're writing books and everything is\nabout getting into product. Yet,\nthere's a lot of folks out there who feel\nthe pull\nto more of the engineering\nside for different reasons\nand maybe opportunities are\nopening up for them on the engineering side,\nbut they're questioning might that be\nthe right move for me? What advice\nwould you have for someone who's trying\nto kind of weigh those pros and\ncons and think about whether that could be,\na great career move for them?\nYeah, based on\nmy history. It's a little bit more\ndifficult for me to kind of summarize\nwhat advice would I give to\npeople in that situation because my\nbackground it was easy for me because I was\npretty much in both walls most\nof the time. But for people\nthat are like right now solely in product and they\nwant to think about stepping outside.\nI think\na good advice would be that\nthey look themselves in the mirrors and\nlook at what they bring right now. What\nis the asset that they have right now?\nI think it's always good to\ninventorise that and making\nsure that you own that and you know what you\nbring to your table. So that when\nyou do want to try to embrace\nother stuff, you know that what\nyou could lean on and you know how you could\ncompensate for what you don't know yet\nand what you're looking to learn with what\nyou're good at. So when you\njoin a different team or a different\norganization,\nyou know that yeah, you're not great in that\ntechnology side yet, but you're compensating\nwith what you bring in the table\nfrom your past experience.\nSo I think that's one advice and the\nother advice is to start\njoining different groups. Like I know\nyou and your firm\ncreated that or help with the Toronto Product\nManagement Association, so that's one organization.\nAnd I'm sure if there's a product\nperson with that sort of thought, there's gonna be\nmore than,\nthat one product person with that sort of some\nsort of thought. So gather\nmuch, talk to other people\nthat are like minded and\nkind of figure out, how are you\ntackling this problem? How are you\nkind of like trying to discover\nyourself? I think that's kind of part of your\nquestion, right? And I think that\nthe last advice I would give is that like in\nthe in the past I was interested in consulting,\nbut like for me to go into consulting,\nnobody's gonna hire me...\nSo I actually try to find\npro bono opportunity to\nto try out consulting\nand see whether that is something I would want\nto do and maybe get my\nmy foot in the door of consulting firms.\nSo\nthat's what I did to try\nto expose myself, to try\nto learn and discover myself - is that what I want\nto do? And to know more people.\nSo to summarize,\ntake a look at your adventure of\nassets, join clubs,\nmeet ups and whatever groups\nthat you have with like minded people\nor maybe venture up to like a purely\ntechnological group see like\ndo you gel with the people?\nIt's the dymanics too, right?\nLike if you gel with the people, you've got chemistry,\na lot of problems, you can solve that.\nAnd the last thing, try volunteering.\nI know there's a lot of nonprofit that look\nfor people with... maybe they need help building a\nwebsite. I know in what we do,\ntechnology is different, but depending\non the spectrum of the product person, right? That might\nbe where you start.\nSuper advice. Thank you so much.\nAlways a pleasure, Handika. Always a pleasure\nchatting with you. Thank you so much for the investment\nof your time\nto share your insights with our community\nand thank you. Thank you again.\nYeah, feeling is mutual Heidi.\nAlways great to chat with you."
