Expanding on OPs point since other commenters are making an incorrect assumption, having an 'intrinsic love of getting to know how something works' != Working extra hours, being obsessive about your role, sacrificing yourself for the bottom line, unhealthy work-life balance, etc. \n\nIn fact, it often results in the opposite. Those are symptoms of yet another complex system that you might want to understand and improve. If that excites you more you should consider management. \n\nI'm in an IC role that allows me to delve into both. Simple example, 50% of PagerDuty alerts are ignored and escalated to the third tier of our workflow, a manager rotation. \n\nA less curious person would say \"this is a leadership problem, teams need to take ownership of their services\" \n\nA more curious person might ask \"why aren't people responding? Is PagerDuty not implemented effectively? Are we burning out when on-call through alert fatigue? Are alerts so rare that team members simply forget about their rotations? Are we pre-configuring too many alerts through our reference pattern? Do devs not have the context needed to take action on their alerts?\" \n\nThe former is 100% right, this is an ownership problem and it's part of the job. The latter wants to find the root cause(s) of the problem, not exclusively address the symptom.",

If you enjoy designing features and writing code, this might be the best path for you.**DevOps Engineers**: Work more on automation, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure, and deployment. The goal is to streamline software development and delivery through automation.\n\nWhich One Has Better Growth?\n\n* Software engineers have a wide range of opportunities, from web and mobile development to AI and cybersecurity.\n* DevOps engineers are in high demand, especially as companies move towards cloud computing and automation.

In addition to not overworking yourself, make sure that the random things you're trying to take on are actually core to the business and align with your career goals.\n\nMy career stalled because I was seen as capable of doing a bunch of different things, so I would keep \"taking on water\".  I would end up getting asked to fill random short term needs, meanwhile others would be groomed to take over ownership of core modules. Guess who was deemed mission critical and who wasn't at the latest round of layoffs.  It didn't help that I had a revolving door of supervisors over the last two years, making it difficult to assess my value when the time came.\n\nObviously sample size of one, but I found it to be a struggle to become strictly necessary to any one endeavor.  As soon as some need arose that I could take care of, I was usually the \"last aboard\" and therefore seen as more available than others on any given team, so I would be pulled away.\n\nI would say that while being flexible in your skillset is a good thing, it's incumbent on you to fight for getting work that is core to the mission.  Becoming the engineer with 1000 tricks by itself is not enough.  Having management understand and support your career goals is also critical, otherwise your face having to answer \"what do you even do here\"\n\nEdit: a word",

      "selftext": "I've been active on this sub for a while now, and the very recent change in atmosphere around here has been quite sobering. I posted [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uj7hnt/is_anyone_noticing_any_sentiment_changes_in_the/) 6 months ago and the responses back then felt like a different lifetime.\n\nI can only imagine how many students, junior or even experienced engineers are feeling anxious right now dealing with the first industry downturn in their professional career. After thinking for a few days I think I should pen a post that may help some people around here.\n\nSome background about me: I graduated college in the middle of the 2008 recession, but since then I have worked at multiple startups (including one YC and one pre-IPO unicorn), 2 of the FAANG companies, and I helped build a startup that saw a decent exit from acquisition. Until very recently I was in eng leadership position at a medium sized tech company. I'm also an angel investor on the side and from my network connections I tend to hear whispers and rumors a bit earlier than most people (part of the motivation of why I wrote that earlier post).\n\n**Disclaimer**: I will try my best to **not** predict the future in this thread. I want to keep this post as matter-of-fact as possible and I want it to be *descriptive* and if the situation applies, *prescriptive*, but I do not want this post to be *predictive*. I have my thoughts and opinions about the future but I do not want to engage in speculation here.\n\nWith all that said, let's start.\n\n**2 major misconceptions I see a lot around here that I'd like to address**:\n\n1.\t\"If I work for a solidly profitable company with a good business model, the recession won't impact me\" -- This is a popular sentiment that usually gets upvoted to the top. There are 2 things wrong with this statement. First is that no companies exist in a vacuum. A company may have a solid business model and good cashflow on its own (eg, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc), but there is no way to guarantee all of their paying customers are in the same shoes, let alone their customers' customers, etc. That's the reason we are seeing all the top companies are giving conservative fiscal outlooks at the moment. Secondly even profitable companies look for reasons to trim fat and cut cost during a downturn. This may start with hiring freezes and may lead to actual layoffs. Different companies do this differently. But just know that leadership do respond to investors and shareholder pressures and sometimes have no choice but to show that they are being fiscally conservative. During the boom time many companies hired people they didn't need just so they can tell a *growth story* to investors and Wall Street, but during a down cycle the reverse can also be true. It's silly I know, but it's what it is.\n\n2.\t\"Engineers aren't going to be impacted\": It is true that engineers are harder to replace and are considered strategic assets for many true tech companies. But as far as cost saving goes, these are some of the *most* delicious fat to trim since engineers tend to command a larger compensation than other roles. Due to the narrative, PR and morale damage, tech companies tend to be a bit conservative with cutting engineers at the beginning stage of a recession. But if things don't get better, cutting engineers *will* be an effective ace-in-the-hole cost cutting measure. Think of it as a \"nuclear option\" for growth tech companies.\n\nThere are some more but I will move on for now.\n\n**Some tips**\n\n1.\tDo Not Panic: I can't stress this enough. Do not worry about things that's out of your control, like macroeconomics or global events. In times like this, I hate to say it, but the best thing to do is be self-centered and focus on yourself. Take a deep breath and know that most mistakes are made by emotional people. And every single minute you are being emotional is a minute you aren't making things better for yourself.\n\n2.\t(Re)Warm Up Your Network: Sometimes it's nice to play by your ego. Recession isn't one of those times. If you can reasonably reach back out to recruiters that you've ghosted in the past, now may be a good time. You don't need to be seriously interested in a job to have them as \"what-if\" options. Similarly true for coworkers and ex-coworkers. Good professional relationships go beyond individual companies and sometimes a solid referral is the difference between weeks of job searching and starting a new position 2 weeks after being laid off. \n\n3.\tIncrease Your Visibility: In some situations I mean that *literally*. Like turning on your webcam once in a while in meetings (and try to use webcam in 1 on 1s especially if your manager/lead does it). I know this is a controversial topic on a sub of introverts and people with social anxieties, but just remember that the people who make decisions during layoff are just that... *people*. They fall for some of the most primitive human flaws, emotions and biases. In the boom time people who are more vocal and visible tend to get rewarded more when compared to people of equal technical skills, and in the bust time they tend to...well keep their jobs better. Be visible to your manager *and* to your coworkers. A few junior engineers telling your manager how amazing of a mentor you've been can go very far in your career, whether it's promotion or layoff. \n\n4.\tPolish Up Interview Skills: Just do enough to make sure you aren't so rusty that you lose confidence. There is no need to spend X hours a day practicing LC unless you think your job security is in imminent risk. It will just unnecessarily stress you out and may even impact your daily job performance, which can lead to unintended consequences.\n\n5.\tFor Graduating Students: Apply to as many places as you can. Keep your expectation realistic. Whatever the type of company you were shooting for 6 months ago, be mentally prepared to accept an offer from a company 1 or 2 tiers below that. It *sucks* I know, but any job on your resume will still be far more valuable than nothing. Edit: Credit to /u/ZhanMing057's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yqmrci/winter_may_be_coming_some_high_level_tips_and/ivpgqtk/), grad school is also an option that should be considered by some people.\n\n6.\tKeep a Good Perspective: I am making an exception to the \"no prediction\" thing here. If this is your first recession, well it won't be the last. But on the other hand the boom time we just saw won't be the last one either. These things come in cycles, but the common denominator across booms and busts are *you*, the person. Focus on learning and growth, and there is always opportunities for those even in the worst of the times. And nothing can take your learning and growth away from you. Focus on things you do have, and know that things are never as bad as they look (I tell people the opposite in good times lol).\n\n7.\tIdentify risks and priorities *if* worst case scenario happen, and plan accordingly: Credit to /u/it200219 's [comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yqmrci/winter_may_be_coming_some_high_level_tips_and/ivp991a/). \n\n**Closing thoughts**\n\nLike I said, I can't predict the future. I *hope* this post is 100% unnecessary in hindsight (and my investment portfolio hopes so too). And if the recession gets bad, you could end up doing all of the above and still get screwed, or (very likely) do *none* of the above and still end up perfectly fine.\n\nBest of luck everyone. I can answer some questions as well.\n\nEdit: One related advice: If your company offers VRIF (Voluntary Reduction in Force), *consider* taking it. Some companies would let people volunteer to get laid off, with the same severance packages. The reason I'm offering this advice is that in a prolonged recession, severance packages get subsequently less generous with latter rounds of layoffs, as the situation becomes more dire. Meta and Stripe's first round came with amazing severance packages. By round 3 (if it gets there), I highly doubt it would remain the same.",

Whatever the type of company you were shooting for 6 months ago, be mentally prepared to accept an offer from a company 1 or 2 tiers below that. It sucks I know, but any job on your resume will still be far more valuable than nothing.\n\nI cannot stress this enough. \n\nI also graduated in the depths of the 2008 recession and had an offer from a big tech company rescinded. Job markets, even in the tech industry are closely tied to the broader economy. When belts tighten and investors look for profitability, the same tech company that promises you that you are a rockstar and that you're like family, will not think twice about letting you go. You could be a top performer in a division that's no longer deemed necessary and you will be cut.\n\nBut the good news is, at least when it comes to dev roles, there is always someone else hiring. It may not pay you FAANG+ money, but it will pay the bills and give you experience. I took a job in a small consulting body shop that paid 55k/year in NYC in 2009. Even in 2009, NYC was super expensive. I didn't like the company or the job, especially when compared to the brand value and the offer I had from the big tech company. I took it anyway because I thought being gainfully employed is better than being jobless and being forced to move back in with my parents. I'm glad that I did, because the job market eventually recovered by 2011 ish, and I found a FAANG job by then, thanks in no small part due to the experience I gained in the shitty consulting gig.\n\nWhen job markets tighten, it is important to focus on being gainfully employed rather than chasing the next big thing. Being prepared and being willing to take jobs that you wouldn't otherwise take will take you far.\n\n> (Re)Warm Up Your Network: Sometimes it's nice to play by your ego.

Good professional relationships go beyond individual companies and sometimes a solid referral is the difference between weeks of job searching and starting a new position 2 weeks after being laid off.\n\nThis one is also another golden nugget. My first FAANG job happened because my immediate manager from a legacy F500 company was hired as a Director at one of the FAANGs and he straight up poached me from there. \n\nIt always pays to maintain good relationships with your former managers, coworkers, and recruiters. Even if I'm not interested in a job a recruiter is messaging me for, I tell them I'm not currently looking to leave, but would like to stay in touch for future opportunities and just add them on LinkedIn.\n\nI got my last job by just messaging one of those recruiters, who then got me to skip the phone screens because I already had another offer. All of these little things add up over time.",

This is more for people with experience than new grads.\n* For new grads, avoid the \"consulting\" jobs where you have 20K penalties for leaving unless you are desperate.  By desperate, I don't mean your parents keep asking when you'll get a job.  I mean your children will starve if you don't get work right away - that desperate.\n* Save, save, save.

If you already have a job, it behaves like a temporary shock, and if you enter after the recovery, the persistence effect is weak. But going into the market during the shock makes the temporary shock more permanent. \n\nThe intuition here is really straightforward.

Be aware of lifestyle creep and try to manage it.\n\n* Be prepared to cut optional expenses if required. I'll drop some subscriptions and adjust the AC to save some money.\n\n* Figure out how to cook at home with basic shelf stable ingredients you can buy in bulk. Beans and rice can be tasty if you do it right. Spices and fat add a lot to dishes. Veggies would probably be a good idea too.\n\n* Maybe have some cheap hobbies in your back pocket to keep your spirits up.
