        "title": "Impact of Galactic non-Gaussian foregrounds on CMB lensing measurements",
        "summary": "Weak gravitational lensing of the CMB has been established as a robust and\npowerful observable for precision cosmology. However, the impact of Galactic\nforegrounds, which has been studied less extensively than many other potential\nsystematics, could in principle pose a problem for CMB lensing measurements.\nThese foregrounds are inherently non-Gaussian and hence might mimic the\ncharacteristic signal that lensing estimators are designed to measure. We\npresent an analysis that quantifies the level of contamination from Galactic\ndust in lensing measurements, focusing particularly on measurements with the\nAtacama Cosmology Telescope and the Simons Observatory. We employ a whole suite\nof foreground models and study the contamination of lensing measurements with\nboth individual frequency channels and multifrequency combinations. We test the\nsensitivity of different estimators to the level of foreground non-Gaussianity,\nand the dependence on sky fraction and multipole range used. We find that\nGalactic foregrounds do not present a problem for the Atacama Cosmology\nTelescope experiment (the bias in the inferred CMB lensing power spectrum\namplitude remains below $0.3\\sigma$). For Simons Observatory, not all\nforeground models remain below this threshold. Although our results are\nconservative upper limits, they suggest that further work on characterizing\ndust biases and determining the impact of mitigation methods is well motivated,\nespecially for the largest sky fractions.",

        "title": "Multi-Agent System for Comprehensive Soccer Understanding",
        "summary": "Recent advancements in AI-driven soccer understanding have demonstrated rapid\nprogress, yet existing research predominantly focuses on isolated or narrow\ntasks. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive framework for holistic\nsoccer understanding. Specifically, we make the following contributions in this\npaper: (i) we construct SoccerWiki, the first large-scale multimodal soccer\nknowledge base, integrating rich domain knowledge about players, teams,\nreferees, and venues to enable knowledge-driven reasoning; (ii) we present\nSoccerBench, the largest and most comprehensive soccer-specific benchmark,\nfeaturing around 10K standardized multimodal (text, image, video) multi-choice\nQA pairs across 13 distinct understanding tasks, curated through automated\npipelines and manual verification; (iii) we introduce SoccerAgent, a novel\nmulti-agent system that decomposes complex soccer questions via collaborative\nreasoning, leveraging domain expertise from SoccerWiki and achieving robust\nperformance; (iv) extensive evaluations and ablations that benchmark\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs on SoccerBench, highlighting the superiority of our\nproposed agentic system. All data and code are publicly available at:\nhttps://jyrao.github.io/SoccerAgent/.",
