    "content": "Create an Infinite Animation With Vanilla Javascript\n\nIn my previous blog post, I showed how to perform simple sound detection. I used requestAnimationFrame for visualization. I even went a step further and created my own React library for drawing graphs. First, I'd like to give a quick recap and reintroduce some of the basics.\n\nWhat is requestAnimationFrame?\n\nIn JavaScript, you can easily create animations using requestAnimationFrame, a feature of the Window API. It has been supported by modern browsers since 2023. With this function, you can make animation calls by providing a callback function. One thing to note is that if the screen is changed or hidden, the animation may pause due to browser optimization. The goal is to ensure efficient use of the user's resources.\n\nA Basic Animation By Using Canvas API\n\nThis application consists of a simple animation including a house, a car, and a tree. First, we set up the basic HTML structure.\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <link href=\"./index.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n        <title>Hello</title>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n         <canvas width=\"500\" height=\"400\" id=\"canvas\"></canvas>\n         <script src=\"Tree.js\"></script>\n         <script src=\"Smokes.js\"></script>\n         <script src=\"Car.js\"> </script>\n         <script src=\"Road.js\"></script>\n         <script src=\"./LineDrawer.js\"></script>\n         <script src=\"House.js\"></script>\n         <script src=\"GreenTerrain.js\"></script>\n         <script src=\"Sky.js\"></script>\n         <script src=\"./main.js\"></script>\n    </body>\n</html>\n\nI represented each object (such as the house, car, and tree) as a separate object in code, and handled their rendering using update and draw functions.\n\nHow to create an animation loop by using the Canvas API?\n\nIn this section, we move on to the animation part - where each object is rendered on the screen in a loop. This is the core rendering logic that makes the scene dynamic and interactive.\n\nconst canvas = document.getElementById(\"canvas\");\n\nif (canvas.getContext) {\n  const ctx = canvas.getContext(\"2d\");\n\n  const road = new Road();\n  const car = new Car();\n  const sky = new Sky();\n\n  const greenTerrain = new GreenTerrain();\n\n  function loadImage(src) {\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n      const img = new Image();\n      img.onload = () => resolve(img);\n      img.onerror = reject;\n      img.src = src;\n    });\n  }\n\n  tree = new Image();\n  house = new Image();\n\n  const animate = (time) => {\n    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);\n\n    greenTerrain.update(ctx.canvas.width);\n\n    sky.draw(ctx);\n    greenTerrain.draw(ctx);\n\n    road.draw(ctx, time);\n    car.draw(ctx);\n\n    window.requestAnimationFrame(animate);\n  };\n\n  Promise.all([\n    loadImage(\"./assets/tree.png\"),\n    loadImage(\"./assets/house.png\"),\n  ]).then(([tree, house]) => {\n    Assets.treeImage = tree;\n    Assets.houseImage = house;\n    window.requestAnimationFrame(animate);\n  });\n}\n\nThis is where our animation loop begins - all objects are continuously redrawn to create motion.\nBefore starting the loop, we need to load all the assets.\nFor this, I used a Promise-based structure to ensure everything is ready before rendering starts.\n\nPersonally, I prefer object-oriented coding because it keeps things clean, understandable, and easy to manage.\n\nDrawing Road to Canvas\n\nIn this part, I used the animation time to create a sense of movement.\nThanks to this approach, it gives the illusion that the car is actually moving forward on the road.\n\nclass Road {\n  draw(ctx, time) {\n    ctx.save();\n    ctx.beginPath();\n    ctx.fillStyle = \"gray\";\n    ctx.rect(0, 350, 500, 50);\n    ctx.fill();\n    ctx.restore();\n\n    ctx.save();\n    ctx.lineDashOffset = Math.round(time / 10);\n    ctx.strokeStyle = \"white\";\n    ctx.setLineDash([20, 20]);\n    ctx.lineWidth = 1;\n    LineDrawer.draw(ctx, 0, 375, 500, 375);\n    ctx.restore();\n\n    ctx.save();\n    ctx.lineWidth = 0.5;\n    LineDrawer.draw(ctx, 0, 350, 500, 350);\n    ctx.lineWidth = 10;\n    LineDrawer.draw(ctx, 0, 400, 500, 400);\n    ctx.restore();\n  }\n}\n\nOther Drawings\n\nIn addition to the road, I created a simple car object. The car itself remains stationary, but by animating the road, it gives the illusion that the car is moving forward. This technique enhances the sense of motion without actually moving the car object.\n\nWhile I used basic shapes for the car, incorporating an image could have provided a more polished appearance.\n\nMoreover, although it might not be evident in the image above, there's also a smoke animation included. This subtle effect adds realism to the scene.\n\nI integrated a simple sky object into the animation.\n\nclass Sky{\n    draw(ctx){\n        ctx.save();\n        ctx.beginPath();\n        ctx.fillStyle=\"skyblue\";\n        ctx.moveTo(0,100);\n        ctx.lineTo(0,0);\n        ctx.lineTo(500,0);\n        ctx.lineTo(500,100);\n        ctx.fill();\n        ctx.restore();\n    }\n}\n\nI generated the positions of the trees randomly in the image. There are 1000 trees in total. If any tree goes outside the screen, its position is recalculated randomly.\n\nclass GreenTerrain {\n  constructor() {\n    this.trees = [...Array(1000).keys()].map(() => new Tree());\n    this.house = new House();\n  }\n\n  update(canvasWidth) {\n    this.house.update(canvasWidth);\n  }\n\n  draw(ctx) {\n    ctx.save();\n    ctx.beginPath();\n    ctx.fillStyle = \"white\";\n    ctx.moveTo(0, 350);\n    ctx.lineTo(0, 100);\n    ctx.lineTo(500, 100);\n    ctx.lineTo(500, 350);\n    ctx.fill();\n    ctx.restore();\n\n    this.trees.forEach((tree) => {\n      tree.update(ctx);\n      tree.draw(ctx);\n    });\n\n    this.house.draw(ctx);\n  }\n}\n\nFinally, we achieved the image as shown in the video above.

    "content": "AI Agent with n8n : From Zero to Hero \ud83d\ude0e\n\n\u2699\ufe0f Can we build an automated production pipeline from coding to code review ?\n\nIntroduction\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb These days, everyone's talking about how AI will replace developers.\n\nBut today, let's flip the script.\n\nInstead of asking \"Will AI take our jobs ? \", let's ask :\n\nHow will AI change the way we work?\n\nAnd more importantly, how can it help us build better, faster, and smarter ? \ud83e\udd14\n\n\ud83d\udd17 If you're not familiar with common AI jargon like LLMs, agents, MCP or RAG, no worries ! Check out my previous article where I break it all down in simple terms.\n\nIn this article, I'll show you how to build an AI agent that automatically reviews code in your GitHub repository using n8n, a low-code automation platform.\n\nWhether you work alone or in a team, this kind of assistant can help you catch issues earlier, and review faster.\n\nWhat is n8n ?\n\nIt is an open-source workflow automation tool, like Zapier or Make but with more flexibility, self-hosting, and developer control.\n\nIn n8n, you build flows visually by connecting nodes :\n\nTrigger nodes (e.g. when a pull request is opened or when a message is sent by the user)\n\nHTTP Request nodes (to fetch/send data via APIs)\n\nAI nodes (like OpenAI, Mistral ...)\n\nCode nodes (for custom logic scripting)\n\nOutput nodes (to post comments, send messages, etc.)\n\nn8n supports hundreds of integration tools :\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f GitLab, Atlassian, Slack, WhatsApp, Google Sheets, Notion, LinkedIn ...\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f And if a node doesn't exist, just use a custom API call with the HTTP Request node.\n\nAI Agents in Workflows\n\nWhat differentiates n8n from its competitors is that it was among the first to integrate AI agents directly into workflow.\n\nAn AI agent is more than just a chatbot. It's a mini system that:\n\nGets a goal : \"Review this code\" \ud83c\udfaf\n\nHas context : the code diff, file metadata, the team best practices database \ud83e\udde0\n\nUses tools: LLMs, APIs, memory, Google Sheet \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f\n\nProduces an output: a comment, update, or suggestion \u2705\n\nEnough theory ! Let's dive into a real example \ud83d\udc47\n\nThe Code Review Workflow\n\nI have a simple iOS app that shows real-time crypto prices, hosted publicly on GitHub and generated by OpenAI.\n\nWe want an AI agent to review every new PR automatically based on the team best practices knowlodge. Here's how the workflow looks :\n\n1- Trigger nodes :\n\nTrigger on Pull Request Creation\n\nUse the existing GitHub Trigger node to start the flow when a developper opens a PR.\n\nIn this step, nothing fancy, just insert your GitHub credentials and link n8n with your code project using the \"on PR creation\" webhook. \ud83d\udd17\n\n\u2705 Once this is set up, you're ready to start reacting to PRs in real-time !\n\nGet File Changes of PR\n\nIf there's no native node, APIs always save the day \ud83d\ude09.\n\nCall the GitHub API to fetch the list of changed files and diffs :\n\nhttps://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/files\n\nWe will use HTTP Request node like this \ud83d\udc47\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Tip : Always test your workflow step by step ! Don't wait until the end.\n\nWhen you check the output fields of the current step, it helps you identify what the input fields of the next step should be.\n\nCode Review Prompt node\n\nThis step requires a little more technical skill (but you can always ask for help from AI \ud83d\ude09).\n\nWe'll write a small JavaScript snippet using Code node to:\n\nExtract the list of code diffs from the output of the previous step.\n\nConcatenate each diff with its corresponding file name.\n\nBuild a natural language prompt combining everything, asking the AI agent to review the code.\n\nThe result will be a well-structured prompt like:\n\n\"You are a senior iOS developer. Please review the following code changes in these files : [filename1]: [diff], [filename2]: [diff]...\"\n\nThis ensures the agent receives the full context to give meaningful feedback.\n\nHere is the full code snippet :\n\nconst files = $input.all().map(item => item.json);\n\nlet diffs = '';\n\nfor (const file of files) {\n  diffs += `### File : ${file.filename}\\n\\n`;\n\n  if (file.patch) {\n    const safePatch = file.patch.replace(/```/g, \"''\");\n\n    diffs += \"```diff\\n\";\n    diffs += safePatch;\n    diffs += \"\\n```\\n\";\n  } else {\n    diffs += \"No patch available (probably a binary file)\";\n  }\n\n  diffs += \"\\n---\\n\\n\";\n}\n\nconst userMessage = `\nYou are a senior iOS developer. \nPlease review the following code changes in these files :\n\n\n${diffs}\n\n---\n\nYour mission:\n\n- Review the proposed code changes file by file and by significant modification.\n\n- Generate inline comments on the relevant lines of code.\n\n- Ignore files without patches.\n\n- Do not repeat the code snippet or the filename.\n\n- Write the comments directly, without introducing the context.\n`;\n\nreturn [\n  {\n    json: {\n      user_message: userMessage.trim()\n    }\n  }\n];\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f You don't need to worry about the line break, \\n is correctly interpreted by OpenAI when used in prompts.\n\n2- Tool nodes\n\nChat Model\n\nEach AI agent needs an LLM model. Here, we'll use OpenAI, but you can easily switch to another provider if needed.\n\nSo you'll need to configure your OpenAI account by providing your API key to n8n. This allows the agent to connect and communicate with the LLM \ud83e\udd16\n\nGoogle Sheet tool\n\nWe'll also feed the code review agent with a Google Sheet that lists all our Swift code best practices.\n\n\u26a1 Now we can add in the prompt a new instruction :\n\n\" - Make a code review based on our Team Best Practices\"\n\n3. Action (output) nodes\n\nPost a Review Comment\n\nIn this step, we'll configure the native GitHub node to post the agent's review directly on the Pull Request.\n\nAdd a Pull Request Label\n\nThis is the final step of our workflow \ud83e\udd73.\n\nWe'll tag the PR with something like \"Reviewed by AI\" to add a clear, visual label indicating the review has been done by our Agent !\n\nNow let's execute the whole workflow and see it in action !\n\nFirst of all, I'll create a new Pull Request to push a modification that adds a new cryptocurrency, 'iota', to the list.\n\nThis change will trigger our automated review process from start to finish :\n\nThe AI agent added a comment and tagged the PR with a \"ReviewedByAI\" label :\n\nNow it feels like you have an expert engineer reviewing every PR for you \ud83d\ude0e\n\n\ud83e\udd14 What could be improved next ?\n\nWhile the current workflow is functional and already adds real value, there are a few areas we can enhance :\n\n1. Inline comments on the exact lines\n\nRight now, the AI agent generates a general review comment on the whole Pull Request.\nBut ideally, it should :\n\nComment inline on each concerned file\n\nTarget the exact line where issues or improvements are detected\n\n\ud83c\udf00 How to do that ?\n\nLoop over the list of modified files obtained in Step 2 (from GitHub's PR files API) and for each file:\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Extract the diff and line numbers\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Feed them to the agent with a precise prompt\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Add a comment using our AI Agent and Github Robot\n\n2. Improve the prompt quality\n\nSometimes, the AI agent:\n\nReturns long, overly detailed reviews\n\nLacks focus on the actual issues or bad practices\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Next improvements :\n\nRefine the prompt to focus on detecting bad practices, instead of just describing the code\n\nAdd the examples of good vs. bad code of our Google Sheet in the context memory to help the agent reason better.\n\n\ud83d\udea7 The full workflow will soon be available as an open-source n8n template.\nMy fork is currently under review... I'll share the link as soon as it's published so you can test it, improve it, and make it your own !\n\nConclusion : Start Simple, Scale Smart\n\nThis workflow is just the beginning, a first step toward building real, useful AI agents into your development process.\n\nBut if you want to go further and build more advanced, context-aware agents that scale across teams and use cases, it's important to follow a solid method.\n\nHere's the 5-step approach I recommend :\n\n1. DISCOVERY\n\nIdentify repetitive, time-consuming, or error-prone tasks that could benefit from automation (e.g. code reviews, reports, support tickets...).\n\n2. DESIGN\n\nMap out the process in detail :\n\nWhat are the inputs ?\n\nWhat business rules or team standards apply ?\n\nWhere does the knowledge live (Google Sheets, docs, APIs...) ?\n\n3. TESTING\n\nTest various scenarios to ensure the AI can handle them reliably.\n\n4. DEPLOYMENT\n\nIntegrate the agent into real workflows.\n Start small : run it in parallel with human review then gradually increase autonomy.\n\n5. MAINTENANCE\n\nAgents are not \"set and forget\" tools. Keep improving them by :\n\nUpdating knowledge sources\n\nRefining prompts or context\n\nCollecting feedback from users and edge cases"

    "content": "Best Practices for Building an Enterprise AI Platform\n\nPragmatic CEOs and business leaders work with their engineering leaders to adopt a platform approach that is scalable, outsourceable, geared for innovation and future-proof.\n\nThis is the fourth in a series of posts meant to help CEOs and business leaders adopt Artificial Intelligence at enterprises. The series tries to cut through the hype and focuses on ROI. These are the author's personal views (Previous post).\n\nEarlier posts in the series talk about how to generate various AI related ideas and the best way to prioritize them. Pragmatic CEOs and business leaders partner with their CTOs to then take a platform approach to implementing these ideas and preparing for future ones. This post suggests a platform architecutre and discusses the best practices.\n\nUnderstanding the Layered Architecture\n\nThe platform architecture diagram presents a comprehensive framework for enterprise AI transformation, structured in layers.\n\nThe Resource Managers layer serves as the fundamental orchestration tier, providing transparent, scalable, and configurable access to underlying resources. Underpinning these Resource Managers is the APIs layer, which provides the actual integration points that Resource Managers coordinate and abstract. These APIs represent the raw capabilities that the Resource Managers make accessible and manageable for the rest of the platform. Above this sits the Common Components layer - logically developed components used by most applications for consistency and scale. At the top is the Applications layer, where individual apps function through the framework.\n\nThis application layer provides for critical capabilities that enable enterprise-grade AI solutions. Applications coordinate complex workflows across various services and components, managing the entire lifecycle from user input to final output, ensuring cohesive experiences regardless of underlying complexity. They also define the prompts or chains of prompts that define the agentic patterns, bring various components together, call on various tools and implement the business logic.\n\nSome applications employ strategic caching at various levels to balance freshness of information with performance requirements, reducing latency and costs while maintaining appropriate responsiveness.\n\nEach application leverages these capabilities while remaining modular participants in the broader ecosystem, drawing from common components while addressing specific business needs. This platformized approach accelerates AI transformation by creating a cohesive ecosystem where components are reusable, consistent, and scalable.\n\nIf you are thinking about such a platform for your own company/ team (highly recommended), please keep the following in mind as well.\n\n1. Treat Every API as an Agentic Tool\n\nThe landscape of AI capabilities is evolving rapidly, with increasingly sophisticated agentic abilities becoming standard in modern applications. By managing every API as a potential tool for your agentic core, you future-proof your entire development.\n\nThe Model Context Protocol represents a promising approach here - it allows your applications to interact with other tools in a consistent way regardless of the underlying implementation. When your own internal applications are developed with modularity and API-driven architecture in mind, they seamlessly become tools within the broader platform.\n\nThis approach creates a virtuous cycle: as LLMs grow more capable of orchestrating complex workflows, your application components can be composed in increasingly sophisticated ways without requiring architectural overhauls. This also means that the speed with which your team can produce new apps gets accelerated.\n\n2. Embrace Transparent Complexity with Strong Defaults\n\nEnterprise AI platforms must balance two competing needs: providing complete control for power users while remaining accessible to everyday users. The solution lies in transparency of tools while establishing strong, intelligent defaults.\n\nConsider LLM selection - rather than forcing users to choose which model is appropriate for summarization versus code generation versus data analysis, implement smart routing that automatically selects the optimal model based on the detected task. The platform should handle the complexity while presenting a simple interface. At the same time, if a particular app has a specific need, it should be able to configure for it.\n\nThis \"complexity behind glass\" approach extends to prompt management, memory systems, and evaluation frameworks. Users of the platform should be able to focus on their business problems rather than AI implementation details, while still having the option to customize when necessary.\n\n3. Design for Ecosystem Extension and Third-Party Integration\n\nNo enterprise can - or should - build every component of their AI in-house. A successful platform acknowledges this reality through deliberate architectural choices that facilitate integration with third-party solutions. A successful platform also seamlessly integrates with third-party apps.\n\nThis requires careful consideration of your organization's \"right to win\" - those areas where your unique expertise and capabilities give you a competitive advantage. Focus your development resources on these components while designing clean interfaces for external tools and services to handle the rest. See this link below for a suggested prioritization framework.\n\nFor example, if customer support automation isn't your core competency, consider integrating established customer service platforms rather than building your own ticketing system, knowledge base, and conversation history management tools. This not only accelerates your time-to-market but also ensures you benefit from specialized expertise in customer experience management while allowing you to focus on your industry-specific AI capabilities.\n\n4. Integrate Evaluation Throughout the Stack\n\nAI systems require continuous evaluation to ensure quality, safety, and improvement over time. A robust enterprise platform doesn't treat evaluation as an afterthought but integrates it throughout every layer.\n\nAt the lower levels, this might include automated unit tests for individual API integrations and components. As you move up the stack, evaluation becomes more sophisticated - measuring hallucination rates, answer relevance, and business impact metrics. Additionally, establish clear patterns for application-specific evaluations, allowing teams to extend the platform's evaluation framework with domain-specific metrics and test cases.\n\nBy providing evaluation capabilities as platform services, you democratize quality assurance and enable teams to implement appropriate testing without reinventing methodologies. You create levers of higher control on the applications, and get the data necessary to celebrate early successes.\n\n5. Create a Unified Experience Layer for Future-Proof Interactions\n\nUser experience channels are multiplying and evolving - from traditional web interfaces to conversational AI, generative experiences, and emerging technologies like AR/VR. Building separate integration paths for each channel creates unsustainable complexity and fragmentation.\n\nInstead, implement a pass-through but integrated layer that standardizes how applications connect to different interaction modalities. This architecture ensures that as new interfaces emerge, your applications can adapt without fundamental changes to their core logic.\n\nThis approach acknowledges that the future of AI interaction will likely involve blended experiences that combine multiple modalities - for instance, a customer service application might switch seamlessly between chat, voice, and visual interfaces depending on the context and user preference.\n\nEnterprise AI platforms face unique challenges compared to consumer applications. Security requirements, governance concerns, legacy system integration, and organizational change management all influence architectural decisions. The platformized approach described above addresses these challenges by creating a structured, consistent framework that still allows for innovation and experimentation.\n\nAs we continue to see AI capabilities evolve at breakneck speed, these architectural principles provide a foundation that can adapt to new models, techniques, and interaction paradigms without requiring constant reinvention.\n\nComplete Series:"
