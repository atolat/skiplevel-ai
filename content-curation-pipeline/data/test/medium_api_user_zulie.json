    "content": "The Case for Killing \"Directionless Verbs\" in Your Writing\n\nThey waste your readers' time and are a writing cop out.\n\nI write for a living, which means that I, more than anyone, know how little people read. This is not a negative sentiment - I know people are busy, our eyes are lazy, and thanks to things like AI text generation and optimizing for search engines, a lot of online writing is unnecessarily chunky and fluffy. In most cases, we're used to scanning instead of digesting text. That means that as a writer, if you want readers to really get what you're trying to say, it's super critical that every word you use earns its place on the page.\n\nI know, for example, that you skimmed that paragraph! Let me restate it in an easy-to-parse single line:\n\nPeople read bad, so every word matters.\n\nThere are many ways writers practice their craft to meet that aim, but there's one I picked up from an old editor of mine that I've never let go (Chris, if you're reading this, thank you forever!):\n\nTake out directionless verbs\n\nWhat is a directionless verb? These are words that communicate some kind of action, but don't tell you the vector (direction) or magnitude (size of the effect). Think of, for example:\n\nChange. Change how? How much? In what way? For better or for worse?\n\nImpact. Good or bad impact? How big was the impact? What effect did the impact have? (I also hate \"impactful\" but that's a rant for another story.)\n\nTransform. How big was the transformation? What was the result of it? Was it a good or bad one?\n\nAnd others like affect, influence, modify, and shift.\n\nHow can you replace them?\n\nSwapping out directionless verbs\n\nTake this sentence as an example: \"The company culture changed over time.\"\n\nWe have no idea how the culture changed. A beneficial change? A big one, a small one?\n\nLet's change it to something more communicative:\n\n\"The company culture deteriorated over time.\"\n\n\"The company culture improved over time.\"\n\n\"The company culture became more refined over time.\"\n\n\"The company culture welcomed women more over time.\"\n\nYou can see that a few simple swaps communicate a lot more with that sentence.\n\nNow let's look at impact, another classic offender. Here's one from in the wild:\n\n\"[T]he innovations they develop today will impact the next generation of automotive manufacturing.\"\n\nAgain, the word impact leaves me curious. In what way will the generation be impacted? Maybe the innovations suck and the next generation will suffer thanks to those innovations.\n\nLet's pick a different word:\n\nThe innovations they develop today will complicate the next generation of automotive manufacturing.\n\nThe innovations they develop today will benefit the next generation of automotive manufacturing.\n\nThe innovations they develop today will undermine the next generation of automotive manufacturing.\n\n(If you want to see more real examples, check out any press release or corporate communication.)\n\nAren't you being pedantic? Does any of this actually matter?\n\nIn a word, yes - I am being pedantic, and the way you write matters.\n\nMaybe you disagree and you think impact and transform are critical words in your arsenal for communication. If so, great! I look forward to enjoying a spirited debate with you in the comment section. But to zoom out and make a grander proclamation, more than the actual writing rules you follow, it's important to have rules to begin with.\n\nFor example, Mark Twain famously instructed one of his students to \"kill your adjectives.\" I disagree! I find adjectives and adverbs flavorsome for writing! But it's something I've thought about and developed an opinion on.\n\nDeveloping your own set of writing rules or guidelines that helps make your writing better, cleaner, clearer, more effective, is part of the journey of being a writer. Especially with LLM text generation proliferating all across the web, the actual craft of writing is getting more and more important.\n\nI have a set of rules I try to stick to when I write. I cribbed some from other writers I respect, I developed some on my own, and others I learned in school. They make my writing better, and the act of developing them has made me a more thoughtful writer.\n\nRead with a careful eye to meaning\n\nI'm not perfect - sometimes an impact or an affect sneaks by me. But in general, I find them to be lazy words that don't communicate enough to the reader. My writing has improved by forcing myself to find replacement verbs that have a direction. Normally, I'm able to replace \"transform\" with a verb that actually says more about what the transformation is and how everyone will be affected by it.\n\nNext time you're penning a draft, I challenge you to ctrl+f for directionless verbs and find a better alternative."
