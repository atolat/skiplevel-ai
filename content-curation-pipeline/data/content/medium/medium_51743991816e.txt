This month's list draws out the recurring theme of the pivotal role of effective communication, trust-building, and leadership behaviour in fostering a productive and innovative engineering culture.

Articles like The Secret to a Great Planning Process - Lessons from Airbnb and Eventbrite and Top Managers Are Abandoning RACI for Impact Delegation highlight innovative frameworks and approaches to planning and delegation that prioritise clarity, collaboration, and empowerment. Continuing the theme of progressing through engineering ranks we have a list of falsehoods that junior developers believe about becoming senior. Contrast this with a perspective from the other side of the table as a new manager looks back on what changes in the step up from individual contributor. Followed up with with 5 Pieces of Advice for Junior Software Engineers Starting their First Job. Finally, if you want to get the vocabulary of management then the DIY MBA: My Reading List is a good, if somewhat selectively edited, place to start.
