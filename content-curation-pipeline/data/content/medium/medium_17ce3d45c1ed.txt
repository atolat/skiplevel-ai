QFM015: Engineering Leadership Reading List April 2024

Everything that I found interesting last month about engineering leadership

In this month's Engineering Leadership Reading List contains a curated a selection of articles that weave together critical themes for engineering leaders, and that also piqued my interest last month.

Several articles such as Improving OKRs and Abolish Performance Reviews, and 10 toxic employees to avoid focus on the employee experience, providing a some contrary examples to the usual narrative.

How to Be a Better Software Engineering Leader asks how you can be better at leading software engineering teams, whilst Everyone lies to leaders shines some light on the way that leadership fundamentally changes the relationship between people, particularly following a promotion to a senior leadership role.

Changing tack towards the practicalities of building software The Grand Unified Theory of Documentation presents a new (or at least, repackaged) way to document software, whilst For God's sake follow the Lean Startup Method implores you to rethink exactly what and how you are "doing" lean/agile product development.

Finally, in Creating Discomfort Zones we look at the (somewhat contrarian) view that favouring comfort over success is a mistaken priority of modern leadership.

Abolish Performance Reviews: Phil Haack argues systematically against performance reviews, stating they are expensive, biased, and largely ineffective. Drawing from various studies and experts like Dr. William Edwards Deming, the post reveals that performance appraisals neither improve performance nor accurately reflect an employee's contribution. Instead, they perpetuate anxiety and discouragement, fail to foster team unity, and are prone to gender biases. Emphasising this, Haack advocates for management styles that prioritise intrinsic motivation, ongoing feedback, and removing traditional performance reviews to better recognise and encourage employee value and team dynamics.
