Everything that I found interesting last month about engineering leadership

Quantum Fax Machine

In the Quantum Fax Machine's March edition of Engineering Leadership Reading List we go from the basics of conducting effective meetings in Stop Wasting People's Time to the metaphorical discussion of power dynamics within teams in You're always carrying a cannon.

A theme this month is the critical importance of pacing and transparency in startup environments, as underlined in The Most Important Skill in Startup Engineering Leadership, where the balance between team performance and well-being is key to sustaining growth without compromising on quality. This is complemented by a deep dive into the venture studio ecosystem through a series of articles from Focused Chaos, exploring the dynamics, strategies, and economics of venture studios with an emphasis on vertical specialisation and the ideal founder profile for venture studios.

For some controversy, we head over to Here's Why You Should Hand Over Product Prioritization to Engineering Managers, underscoring a pivotal shift towards leveraging frontline technical expertise for strategic innovation and exploring the degree to which the CTO and CPO roles are merging into one another.

Sketchplanations is a wonderful site that explains a broad range of topics through sketches and AI startups requiring new strategies, looks at the distinct challenges and strategic imperatives for startups in the AI revolution.

We finish up this month with a look at some interesting Gallup workplace statistics for 2022 that emphasise the significance of leadership in addressing employee engagement and well-being in modern work environments.

As always, the Quantum Fax Machine Propellor Hat Key will guide your browsing. Enjoy!
