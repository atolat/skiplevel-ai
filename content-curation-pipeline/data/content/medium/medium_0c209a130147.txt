QFM019: Engineering Leadership Reading List May 2024

Everything that I found interesting last month about engineering leadership

In this month's Engineering Leadership Reading List, we kick off with Nicola Ballotta's Don't Manage Up, Team Up Instead, which challenges traditional hierarchical management, advocating for a collaborative "Teaming Up" approach. This article highlights the importance of mutual help, open communication, and shared responsibility, emphasizing equality and distributed leadership as keys to fostering innovation and collaboration within teams.

The Key Takeaways from the 2024 Tech Leader Compensation Survey reveal ongoing industry turbulence, with disparities in compensation and an increase in interim and advisory roles. This survey underscores the need for tech leaders to navigate hybrid work environments and address equity gaps to maintain competitive advantage and team morale.

Effective communication is a recurring theme this month. Vinita Bansal's How to be Direct Without Being Rude provides practical strategies for maintaining honesty and empathy in conversations, crucial for leaders aiming to foster a respectful and transparent work culture. Similarly, Managing High Performers emphasises the need for structure, feedback, and clear expectations to help high performers reach their full potential, highlighting the delicate balance between guidance and autonomy.

In a thought-provoking piece, 3 reasons you shouldn't hire a Technical CTO, Allan Degnan humorously argues the essential role of technical competency in leadership, illustrating the pitfalls of non-technical leadership through satire. This theme is echoed in Culture of Competency, which stresses the interconnectedness of technical skills and cultural alignment in driving business performance.

Low Process Culture, High Process Culture - Accidentally in Code examines the transition from low-process to high-process cultures. The article explores the benefits and challenges of both approaches, emphasising that true success often depends on a collective mindset and the willingness to transcend procedural compliance.

Finally, The Anatomy of a Successful Team Squad delves into the implementation of the Spotify Squad Model, highlighting the balance of autonomy and agility with the need for supportive culture and leadership. And We're in the midst of a fundamental shift in leadership discusses the shift from positional authority to influence-based leadership, drawing lessons from activists and thought leaders to inspire and motivate teams.
