Everything that I found interesting last month about engineering leadership

Quantum Fax Machine

Welcome to the third QFM post for 2024! This post is a link list covering everything I found interesting about Engineering Leadership during January.

Each link has a short summary to give an overview of the post, plus some hashtags for organisation. Both the summary and the hashtags are courtesy of GPT, but the filtering of what made the list is all mine.

I have also provided a handy key using propellor hats, which I hope will further help you determine which articles are worth your time.

Let me know if you like the format or if you can think of any changes that would make the list more useful.

Insight ðŸ’¡

There is a link between the last two articles in that they both refer to the way that startups often eschew structure and even celebrate their lack of structure as a virtue, as it allows them to operate unconstrained. The discussions reveal some nuances about the role of hierarchy and autonomy in organisational growth.

On the one hand, the HR Antipatterns article highlights the pitfalls of neglecting structured roles like HR in tech startups, leading to systemic issues such as favouritism and a lack of diversity strategies. This lack of structure can result in dysfunctional management and a workplace environment unsupportive of employees. On the other hand, the Questionable Advice article argues for the necessity of hierarchy, particularly in the form of engineering managers in startups. This structure is viewed as essential for adaptability, efficiency, and scalability. Engineering managers play a pivotal role in coordinating teams and focusing on organisational goals, thereby preventing organisational debt and enhancing productivity.

However, there is a middle ground as there is (generally) no one-size-fits-all approach to management and hierarchy in startups. The key is to balance the need for structure with the level of autonomy that a team can handle. This balance depends on the maturity and capability of the team. While too much focus on process can detract from product development, some level of management, whether formal or informal, is necessary to guide teams, especially in areas like HR.

The overarching theme is that while startups may benefit from a certain fluidity and lack of rigid structure, completely eschewing management can lead to significant organisational challenges. Effective leadership involves recognising the need for and appropriately implementing management structures to support the team's needs and the company's objectives.

HR Antipatterns at Startups: This article discusses the prevalent issues in HR practices at tech startups, highlighting systemic problems such as neglecting HR roles, fostering a culture of favouritism, and lacking diversity strategies. These issues often lead to dysfunctional management and workplace environments that do not effectively support employees. #HRInTech #StartupCulture #DiversityInTech #ManagementChallenges #TechWorkplace

Questionable Advice: "My boss says we don't need any engineering managers. Is he right?": This article discusses the necessity of engineering managers in a startup. The writer addresses a VP of Engineering at a startup with about 40 engineers, organised into small teams led by lead engineers primarily focused on coding. The CEO, a former engineer, opposes hiring engineering managers, viewing them as unnecessary overhead. The article argues that hierarchy, often misunderstood and misused, is crucial for the adaptability, efficiency, and scalability of organisations. It also emphasises the distinct roles and benefits of engineering managers in coordinating teams, managing information, and focusing on organisational goals, highlighting that effective management is key to avoiding organisational debt and ensuring productivity. #EngineeringManagement #StartupLeadership #OrganizationalGrowth #TeamDynamics #LeadershipInsights
