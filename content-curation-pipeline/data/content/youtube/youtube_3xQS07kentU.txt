Today, we are covering about
the engineering career.
I'm sure many of you are working
as an engineer or are thinking
of becoming an engineer.
Have you ever thought through how you
can optimize your career as an engineer?
Or maybe whether engineering
itself is the right career for you?
Also what happens to some of us is
that after becoming an engineer for
a number of years, we do not feel
the same enjoyment and fulfillment
as we started in the beginning.
And then comes up the question
of what's next that I should do?
How can I navigate my career and even
potentially make career transitions?
If these are some of the thoughts that
you have in mind, then I hope today's
episode will be worth a listen for you.
My guest for today's
episode is Jeff Perry.
Jeff is an engineering coach, the founder
of More Than Engineering, and the cohost
of the Engineering Career Coach podcast.
In this episode, Jeff shared
the important role of a coach or
mentor in our engineering career,
especially when faced with all the
questions that I mentioned earlier.
We first discussed Jeff's engineering
career clarity checklist, and why
it is truly important to find the
clarity in our career journey.
Jeff then shared the role of an
engineering career coach, how a coach
can help us navigate our career, and the
difference between a coach and a mentor.
Throughout our discussion, we also
touched on a few other topics such as
the Great Resignation trend and what
are some of the things behind it, making
intentional career transitions taking
lessons from what Jeff has done in his
career, transitioning to a leadership
role, and the power of accountability.
I enjoyed my conversation with
Jeff, discussing about the role
of an engineering career coach or
mentor, and also the engineering
career clarity checklist.
And I liked the way Jeff explained
that we shouldn't navigate
our career journey alone.
There are people and resources
available out there who can help us
make better decisions, especially for
something as important as our career.

Hello, everyone.
Welcome back to another new episode
of the Tech Lead Journal podcast.
Today I have with me a guest who is also
a host of a podcast, the Engineering
Career Coach podcast, which has
been around for more years than me.
Today my guest is Jeff Perry.
So he's actually the engineering
career coach and also leadership coach.
Jeff actually came from the engineering
background, not just software engineering,
also mechanical and also manufacturing.
So it's really interesting how you
can combine all these engineering.
Later, maybe you can discuss about that.
I'm actually very excited today to
talk about engineering career and
coaching and leadership in general.
So hope to have this great
conversation with you today, Jeff.
Jeff Perry: Absolutely.
I'm excited about this, Henry.
Thanks for having me.
Henry Suryawirawan: Normally, I
would start by asking my guest
to share his or her story.
Maybe telling us more about your
highlights or career turning points.
Jeff Perry: Yeah.
So, as you noted, I've kind of
taken a winding road through
a lot of different technical
disciplines and different things.
It started when I was a kid.
I'd really gravitated towards
science and math and things like
that, like many engineers did.
Because there was like certainty in a
lot of the things that I was doing there.
I always really loved being
right and having right answers.
From an early age, I think it
was ninth grade, I was like, I'm
going to be a mechanical engineer.
That's what I was going to do.
And so, I never wavered from that.
I went to school, did
mechanical engineering.
It was great.
Then I got into some research during
my undergraduate degree and it was
connecting some of the software
pieces of mechanical design and 3D
CAD systems and things like this.
Through that, I got connected
with an automotive company that
wanted to do more of that work.
There was a partner in the
research that we were doing.
And so, ended up with a job writing
code, even though I'd only had
two software courses in school.
Most of my stuff was on the
mechanical and physical hardware side.
Here I was writing code every day when I'd
only taken a couple of software courses.
So I felt kind of like
a fish out of water.
But I really tried to look at
that as an opportunity for me to
learn a different sort of industry
and really dived into that.
So I really enjoyed learning about
software frameworks, APIs, Agile
methodologies, and more in that world.
There's a lot of things that I learned and
got perspectives of when I was doing that.
But I also realized that, hey, for
me personally, writing code all day,
every day, wasn't what I wanted to do.
It's not where I found a lot of joy.
So I actually had an opportunity to
go to a smaller company and dived
into my first leadership experience.
And they wanted me because I'd also done
some like entrepreneurship side projects.
I had the mechanical and the software
aptitude, and I could really bring
a lot of these disciplines together.
It really kind of almost became a
product owner over a technology.
I tried to grow a new market utilizing
existing technologies and find a roadmap
for new technologies for the company
where they were doing a physical sensor.
So there were hardware capabilities
where we're working with electrical
and mechanical engineers, and we had
to manufacture these things, plus
the software side, data acquisition
systems and things like this in
the cloud or on-prem depending on
how we were doing that at the time.
And so it was a lot of different
things going on there trying
to bring all this together.
So I did that for a while.
Then I shifted again towards operations
and this was more process-oriented using
technology to simplify enhance operations.
Make sure we're collecting the right data.
Really take that continuous
improvement methodology and
approach and different initiatives.
So those are kind of the big
shifts in the corporate world.
And obviously, we can talk
more about what I do now.
Eventually got to a career plateau where
I knew that what I was doing wasn't a
perfect fit for me or the company anymore.
And so had some tough conversations
and even got to a point where I said,
"Hey if we can find an adjustment
that really is a fit for me, I'd
be happy to explore that with you.
But if things stay the way they are,
then it's probably best for me to leave."
Like I recognize that where
I was not really giving my
best work for the company.
It also wasn't great for me, and
so had those tough conversations.
We explored some things.
Nothing really felt like a great fit.
But I was okay if it was
time to go and actually was.
Then it was like, okay, what's next?
I didn't actually have
anything lined up for me.
I wouldn't always
recommend that for people.
But it's what I needed to do.
So I spent a lot of time getting
clarity on what I really wanted.
In the end, kind of brought together
this entrepreneurship bug that I had.
Wanting to stay close to technology
and engineering, but also over the
course of time, recognize that helping
people grow and developing people was
something that was really important to me.
I had opportunity to do that,
and I found that's where I really
lit up and found joy in my work.
So that was kind of where I
found my own kind of genius zone.
Put it all together and
doing what I'm doing now as a
leadership and career coach.
So that's maybe long and
short of the story for me.
Henry Suryawirawan: Hearing
your story, I can see so many
transitions in your career.
One of the topics that we'll be talking
about is about career transitions.
But I think before we went there, one of
the things that I also see in your career
is that there are many facets, right?
You started from, maybe, doing
engineering, mechanical, software and keep
on continuously improving and exploring.
It's not just fitting into one
particular role, but actually
moving into multiple facets and
seeing where you can grow further.
Although eventually it met a plateau.
But I think, now you are an
entrepreneur and you started this
company called "More Than Engineering".
So tell us more what is
More Than Engineering does?
Jeff Perry: Yeah.
So More Than Engineering is the name
I put for what I do as a leadership
and career coach, specifically for
engineers and technology professionals.
And the "More Than" piece is this idea
of okay, engineering might be this
professional identity that you might have
as an engineer technology professional.
But I want to look at the whole person.
Look at who are you?
What are you trying to become beyond
just building your technical skills,
which is absolutely important?
But what about in leadership,
personal development?
What do you want to do in your community?
Or other ways you want to give and
support, like who do you want to become?
This is really trying to take this
larger holistic approach to personal
development, but coming from a, "Hey,
I've got this broad range of experience
in the engineering and technology world.
But I've also now developed a very
wide tool belt of things that we
can do to look at where you're at
and where do you want to get to?
How do we make that happen?
A lot of that is around
career development.
People trying to say, "Hey, I'm not
really happy with where I'm at right now.
How do I do that?"
Or I'm trying to grow in my leadership
approach, building a new team,
trying to grow these certain skills.
How do we do that in a sustainable
way instead of just prescribing
behaviors, things to do?
Okay.
Try this.
Try this.
Trying to look at how do
we make this actually a
transformational experience for you.
And so that's really the essence
of what we're trying to do.
Henry Suryawirawan: One of the
things when I went to your website,
you have this career checklist.
You call it engineering careers checklist.
It's very interesting to me because I
didn't have that checklist,  nor that
I thought about having a checklist
before I went into engineering.
So tell us more, why do you
have this career checklist?
And what's the purpose?
How does it help someone to decide whether
engineering is the career for them?
Jeff Perry: Yeah.
So I call it the engineering
career clarity checklist.
What this is really designed for is those
people who are at those points, who are
saying, "You know, I wonder if there's
more to what my career could look like
rather than just showing up, getting
a paycheck and going home and watching
Netflix" Or staying home and watching
Netflix if you're working from home.
Because engineers and
technology professionals have
a huge amount of versatility.
I mean, I'm an example of that, of
like all the different areas I've done.
But I've talked to so many engineers
who have done so many different things
across different technology disciplines,
across different roles they've played.
They can stay.
They can go deeper in tech.
They can stay broad.
They can work across products.
They can work across projects,
large programs, leading large
teams, whatever that turns into.
But there are plenty of people who are
like, I know something needs to change,
but I don't know what that actually is.
How do I find the alignment in that?
So that I'm actually really enjoying.
Cause I know what I want is to actually
wake up and feel excited about work,
where right now I'm feeling like I'm being
drained and not excited about that at all.
So the career clarity idea is
like, okay, how do we find that?
Two analogies I use is ways of thinking
either clarity like a north star, like
the things that you really want to get to
that kind of keeps you aligned with where
you're going, or maybe another way to
look at it as a set of filters of things
like  what's really important to you?
So as opportunities or things come
your way, how do you run those through
your filters and see if they meet
criteria that are right for you?
If so, let's continue to explore.
If not, then don't waste any
more time on there because you've
already identified those things
that are most important to you.
So there's a number of
different tools within that.
It's a checklist of activities and
exercises you can use to really do some
introspective work and identify that
north star, those set of filter, that
you need to use so that you can get
the clarity with where you want to go.
Henry Suryawirawan: So some of the
things that you advocate in the
checklist is finding the "why".
Maybe many of us get to work to get
paycheck and go on with our lives.
I'm not sure whether all engineers
really have a clear goal in
mind before they start a career.
So tell us more about why do
we need to find the "why"?
And what are some of the "whys"
that engineering should think
about by becoming an engineer?
Jeff Perry: Yeah.
And this could be becoming an engineer
or a certain type of engineer or engaging
like in a certain industry or something
that's actually important to you.
This comes from a tool that I used
when I was in manufacturing, where a
lot of times there was a problem on
the manufacturing line or something.
We need to dive into the root cause of it.
We use a tool that is pretty common
called "The Five Whys" to dive into
root cause analysis and saying, "Okay.
You initially look at what the problem
is that you think is the problem."
And then you keep asking, why is that?
Why is that?
You keep going deeper and deeper.
We use the same tool of these five whys.
You can go more than five and say,
okay, what's the goal you have?
Something you want to get to.
But then what we're trying to
do is unlock what's the deeper
level of intrinsic motivation.
What's really the driver for you?
That's pushing you to
want to make this goal.
And I've had people have all sorts of
different answers to this in the end from,
"Hey, I really want to find something
that's exciting for me in my career
because I watched my parents both hate
their careers through their lives, and
I grew up with that and I hated that.
And I don't want that to be how I
end up for the rest of my career, and
so I want to find this alignment."
That's one type of answer.
Another person said, "You know what?
I want to find my happy
place in  my career.
I don't know what that is, but
I'm trying to figure that out."
Another person could be really passionate
about sustainable energy and things like
that, and so, they were making the move
from medical devices over to green energy
and buildings and things like that.
Because they recognize that's an industry
that was very important to them that
they wanted to be actively involved in.
Other people who want to work on certain
types of products or things like this.
Or rather, people want to get involved
in scale, or it's really about their
opportunities for personal growth
and different opportunities that
are going to help them do that cause
they don't want to feel stagnant.
So it can be all sorts of things.
But the question is like, what is it for
you that really drives you to want to get
up and go and do things in your career?
And so identifying that deeper
level "why" can be really powerful.
Henry Suryawirawan: There are so many
things that you mentioned just now
that people look for in their jobs.
So I think the key here is
to find intrinsic motivation.
How to align that with your career?
It's not just some job that you
need to do to get paycheck, but
to get that fulfillment as well.
Another thing that you mentioned
in the checklist is that we
need to find "our genius zone".
Tell us more what is this genius
zone and how do we use that?
Jeff Perry: Yeah.
So put simply, the genius zone
is where you do your best work.
Okay.
A couple of different ways to look
at this, and also recognize that
your genius zone can evolve too.
As you go through different experiences.
If you would've asked me
five years ago about me.
"Hey, can I do leadership and career
coaching for engineers like that?"
That wouldn't have been that because it
took me a few years of getting experience
of doing training and kind of internal
coaching and development inside of the
company that I was at for a while, and
kind of unlocking that piece of me.
And then also having more experience
on the technical side to have the
broader range of things that allowed
me to feel like, "Hey, I had the
confidence that I could do this
and I could put that together."
So that's one way to look at it
as like these combinations of
things that you're really good at.
So you may be good at one particular
type of software application or
product development or leadership.
You can look at those as separate
things, but when you combine them, the
combination of them create something
that's quite unique and different.
Because you have certain insights
into financial institutions if
you're in fintech or something like
that, or other types of industries.
And so it's industry,
it's passion, it's skills.
When you combine them, do you have a
unique value that you can bring where
you can really deliver exceptional work?
Where you can do your best work?
So that's one way to look at genius zone.
Another way is to look at it like,
okay, when do you feel like you kind
of get in the zone,  or in a state of
flow, if people are familiar with this?
The idea of flow comes from a researcher
by the name of Mihaly Csikszentmihaly.
I think he passed away a few months ago.
He's been quoted extensively
on his research in flow.
And it's like this combination
of challenge and the skills
that you bring to the table.
You can kind of get into this flow state.
But what is that for you?
It's almost that time or those experiences
or those things you work on, you hardly
feel time passing, but you're just
really in that zone, because you're
excited about things and what is it that
you're doing that unlocks that for you?
Can we find ways to do more of that?
Cause that's something that you've got
some natural inclinations, but also
some skills that you've developed that
really allow you to do some amazing
work when you're in that space.
How can we do more of that?
So you can really deliver your best value.
So we can identify that.
Then maybe we can find a role or
an opportunity that can align and
give you more opportunities to
do your best work in that way.
Henry Suryawirawan: So I find that
these two questions are really,
really important, especially as
you go along in your career, right?
Maybe 5-10 years.
It's not like in the beginning.
I think these two questions can
help people who feel stuck or feel
de-motivated or didn't get the sense
of fulfillment, also people who
want to explore new areas of growth.
It could be new role, new career,
new industry, and all that.
You seem to have lots of experience
at doing career transitions.
Part of this exercise, I believe, that
people will make career transitions,
and jump into different areas, which
they may have not explored before, but
this is something that they are good at.
So, tell us more, how can we make this
more intentional career transition?
Maybe after you do this exercise,
how do we navigate that?
Jeff Perry: Yeah.
So that's a perfect question.
And you said the right word that's
really important to me is like
being intentional about this.
Okay.
Because I talked to so many people
and they're like, "Hey, I know I
want to make a move or something."
But usually initially, or often
initially what they're motivated
by, I don't like what I'm doing.
And so they're just trying to move
away from where they're at right
now, cause they know what they're
doing right now isn't great.
But what we want to do is not
just find a new opportunity or
job or situation, but the right
opportunity and situation for them.
It's about being proactive,
not reactive, like saying I
want to identify what I want.
What's important to me?
And then I want to go through
a strategic process to go find
it and make that a reality.
So it's about moving towards what you
want to do and become, rather than moving
away from something you don't want.
And that's just a much more powerful way
of going about any change that you're
trying to make in your life is thinking
about a positively framed approach to
how do you move towards what's important,
what you want rather than moving
away from something that you don't.
So I've designed a whole approach and
program to this called the Engineering
Career Accelerator, that's really designed
to help engineers move through this
intentional career transition and get
into the right opportunity and situation.
It's been my pleasure to help a lot
of people and I get the opportunity
to kind of have that front-row seat
to working with people through this
process and helping them grow to get
where they want, but also, again, we try
and design this in a way that trying to
be a transformational experience where
they're not just successful in landing
the opportunity, but they see that
there're benefits and changes they've
made that are going to help them as they
continue forward throughout their career.
And that's really what
it's designed to do.
Henry Suryawirawan: So, again,
you emphasize the keyword
intentional or deliberate here.
It really struck me when you said
that many people want to make
career transitions because they
just think they don't want to
do whatever they're doing now.
It's more about moving away or
running away from their situation.
But towards where?
Maybe they are not sure about.
So this is something that
probably is critical, right?
When I hear about great resignation or
maybe during pandemic, people are not
fulfilled or suffering with their career.
So maybe this is also partly why
that many people are resigning.
I don't know whether in your coaching or
maybe in your training session, you have
this study case about great resignation.
Is there some kind of things that you want
to give insights whether people are making
the right transitions during this time?
Or actually still the
same kind of problem?
Jeff Perry: Yeah, so, I mean, we've gone
the whole gamut throughout the pandemic
and the great resignation experience.
From, hey, there're layoffs upon
layoffs across the world because the
pandemic to now we're in a place where
unemployment is really low, and it's
really hard for companies to find people.
They're trying to grow like crazy.
And maybe there are some long tail
effects of that, of some people
who left the workforce for a longer
period of time and are coming back.
I think we're still trying to sift
through some of the data around that.
But there was some significant
data around, like 2021.
So we were already through kind
of the first year of the pandemic.
In the US, there was the highest
quit rate that we've had in decades.
That was significant.
I think it was just a lot of people
going through that process and kind
of stepping back and trying to figure
out okay, what do I really want?
So some of that people actually
have that time to be introspective
because they couldn't leave their
homes for one reason or another.
Or some people got forced into looking for
something else cause they got laid off.
And others, especially in particular in
the software space, found that because
they were more primed for the remote work
opportunities and there were a greater
need to want to do more automation
and software pieces, there were a lot
of opportunities in front of them.
There's been a lot of wage expansion
and compression and things like that.
People are like, "Hey, I can get a
significant raise if I make a move.
Well, I'm going to do that."
So sometimes they're chasing the money.
Sometimes they actually did some of
that intentional work to try and figure
out what's really right for them.
In the conversations that I had, and
I've talked to hundreds of people
one-on-one is that I find that those
who are driven by fear through the
process are often the ones that
kind of lost out on opportunities.
It didn't really make progress.
But those who are driven by opportunity
and what's possible and look for, how
can I make the most of the situation?
Those are the ones who found the
opportunities and were able to
continue to grow and progress
instead of taking a break and staying
stagnant, or maybe losing ground
during the last couple of years.
Henry Suryawirawan: So,
currently you are a coach.
At least in my part of the world, it's
not common to have an engineering coach,
engineering career coach, particularly.
So tell us more, why should
engineer think about having a coach?
And how does it differ
between mentors and coach?
Because these two terms are always
used sometimes interchangeably.
But maybe you can give us clarity.
Why an engineer should
look for career coach?
Jeff Perry: Yeah.
So I mean, engineers are notorious
for being problem solvers, right?
And figuring things out.
That's one of the things
that engineers do best.
There aren't all that many of us who
are coaches, specifically for engineers,
but there are a few and because I'm in
the industry, I know a number of them.
But think about this.
I'm just a huge proponent and believer
that when we're trying to make changes
in our lives, we shouldn't change
alone, and try and do that alone.
We need people in our life to support
us and help us through that process.
What a mentor or a coach can do is
really provide that outside perspective.
Maybe see things in you and work the
problems you're going through and
the opportunities that are in front
of you that you might not be able to
see because we all have blind spots,
whether we like to believe it or not.
We do.
And so, we need that help.
Mentors and coaches can also help
expand your network and give you access
to insights and people that you might
not otherwise be able to connect to.
And also, just a big opportunity
to give you frameworks, activities,
maybe a community to be involved in.
One of the most powerful things is the
power of accountability you can have.
That you are invested in yourself and
have someone who is invested in you.
Trying to help you move through
this process because you have maybe
regular meetings and situations and
things you're trying to report on.
Then, you got this extra motivation.
I've got something I've got to deliver.
So there's a lot of
benefits, a lot of that.
When we think about the difference
between a mentor and a coach.
Maybe the separations, a mentor
is often kind of someone who
would volunteer to help you, maybe
it's someone in your workplace.
Often, workplaces will have mentoring
programs and things that you can get
connected to, or you can just find
someone you want to connect to ask
questions on a semi-regular basis.
Or maybe someone in another community
setting that you can connect with.
But they just kind of help
and we connect with them.
It's often informal.
It can be formal.
It kind of depends on how
you set that relationship up.
But a coach is often paid,
something that you would invest in.
They're also uniquely invested
then in your success because
they win when you win.
It's how they're set up.
So it's often a third-party
person outside the perspective of
where you're at in your company.
And so, they don't have any other
agenda to keep you in your company
or get you out or whatever, other
than you being successful and
what's most important to you.
That investment in you through
that process can be really,
again, transformational.
Coaches also bring, often,
a more intentional framework
and are more proactive in your
experience rather than a mentor is.
They'll often show up and like, "Okay.
What questions do you have for me?"
And they can be fabulous and wonderful.
But a coach is more like really
bringing something from the experience.
More often than a mentor would.
Henry Suryawirawan: So you mentioned
a technique, which I find really
interesting and also powerful.
This power of accountability.
Again, I'm not sure, but I can just
look from my personal experience.
Sometimes I don't do this
accountability for my career.
So things could be just thinking
in our head or just consulting
with our family members.
But the accountability, I think, is a
very unique angle that people can explore.
Tell us more about how can we find
accountability partners or maybe
some kind of accountability framework
for us to navigate our career?
How does this work?
And maybe you can give us examples.
How can this accountability help someone
to navigate and make career transitions?
Jeff Perry: Yeah.
So, you can use accountability
in any area of your life.
To put some data to it, I think the
Association for Standards and Training
Development (ASTD) did a study on the
power of accountability from someone who's
got a goal that they want to accomplish.
You just have the idea of a goal.
It's about a 10% chance
that you're going to do it.
If you like write it down,
it increases like 25%.
If you tell someone,
it gets up to like 50%.
But if you get to the point where you
have someone who you're accountable to,
that you have a specific date set up
to be accountable and deliver to them
on a specific day, it's like 95% of the
time you're going to deliver on them.
So we go from 10% of, I have an idea
of something I want to do, to I'm
accountable to someone I've got a
specific date tied to that deliverable.
So from 10% to 95%, you're
going to frame that.
So that's just from a
pure data perspective.
That shows some real power in
the power of accountability.
You can find people in your life.
I mean, these can be partners, spouses,
friends, mentors, and personal community
and your family or other things.
Just, again, like this idea of
not making changes alone brings
a little bit accountability.
You're even sharing with someone
that you're trying to do this
rather than holding onto yourself.
Yeah.
It feels a little vulnerable, but that
can actually sometimes light a fire
in you to actually take some action.
But then taking that next level to maybe
invest in yourself, get some specific
help and a coach or something that could
be next level because they're going
to be helping you in different way.
Anyway, this accountability area or
principle can just be so powerful to
say, "Hey, I want to do something, but
instead of just thinking about it, I'm
actually going to do something about this.
Share this with other
people and ask for help."
You'd be surprised how many
people are actually willing to
help and support you through that
process in many different ways.
You can get some people who are willing
to do little check-ins and things like
that with you, if that's what you want.
Cause sometimes, especially if
you've got a full-time job and
other responsibilities, now you're
trying to do something else, it'd
be hard to put in that time and that
effort because we're tired and got
a lot of other things on our plate.
But when we have other people supporting
us and holding us accountable or we feel
accountable to, and then that can keep
the fire going and keep us rolling there.
Henry Suryawirawan: So some
people also find gamification
as part of accountability.
So maybe you use tools to do habit streak.
And also some people put some
more stakes, like put money.
So yeah, if I didn't do X,
I'll put some money for you.
So I think that kind of like also
works as a accountability technique.
Jeff Perry: I've got a friend
who's wanting to write a book.
And so if he doesn't get that book
manuscript submitted by a certain time
this year, then he owes me 500 bucks.
That's going to light a fire for him.
So it's just a funny way.
That works for him.
That negative pressure doesn't
work for everyone, but that's
something that's really pushing him.
I rail him on that whenever
we talk almost every week.
So whatever works for you.
That's what we're trying to find.
Henry Suryawirawan: So one of the major
transition for engineers is to actually
navigate between individual contributor
and to leadership or management.
In your career, you also mentioned
that you have navigated that process
as part of your career coaching, or
I think your training in general,
is also a leadership aspect.
So tell us more, how can someone
have this mindset transition between
an individual contributor to more
leadership or management role?
Jeff Perry: Yeah, this is a
critical transition for a lot of
people, if it's the right thing for
them, and if it's the right time.
So we need to recognize the
shift that's taking place here.
As an individual contributor, your
best value and your expectations
completely surrounding around that the
technology progress that you deliver.
Whether that's, you know, the code
that you're writing, the product
that you're working on and thing
that you're developing or designing.
Whatever that looks like.
It's about what are you
delivering in that way?
When you make that shift to
leadership and management, that's
not where your focus is anymore.
As in you delivering the technology.
It's you enabling your team to do that.
And that's a shift, and it's really
hard for many people to let go of the
direct ownership of this is the code
that I wrote and I own and I know it.
A lot of times you're kind of
having to give up your baby you
were working on it for a long time.
Especially if you're like staying on the
same team and then becoming the leader.
That's really difficult.
Or even if you're shifting things,
you just have to completely
let that go and hand that off.
But that impulse to, "I don't
know exactly so I'm going to go in
and solve that problem for them."
That's not enabling them both to
make the best decision in the moment,
but also to enable them to grow.
And that doesn't mean that you shouldn't
bring in your technology insights.
It just means that you need to step away.
Recognize that your shift from
you're not going to be writing
code or diving into the details of
everything on the technology side.
And there are so many challenges
to people letting go of this
idea and really delegating.
"Hey, if I don't do this,
it's not going to be done."
Or fear of quality going down.
Or if I don't do this, it'll take longer.
Then I need to train people.
There's all sorts of things.
But that's really what the shift is about
and really taking the personal approach
to how can I enable them, but also help
them grow to become the people and the
professionals that they want to become.
And how do I align their goals
with the company's needs and
work across these various things?
And so there's  a deeper
level of understanding.
People really need to understand
processes and understand higher-level
areas of how different pieces
of technologies fit together and
eventually deliver to whatever the
final product or services in that way.
And so, it's a big shift.
Because usually as individual contributor,
you're being delivered your tasks and
maybe you have influence there as you're
planning and things like that, what
that looks like and moving through.
But then suddenly, as a leader,
you're identifying those and
managing across multiple people and
working across functions usually.
It's a big shift, but it's an
important one for people to get right.
So, again, it's a change.
Make sure you have at least some mentors
to help you through that process, so
you don't have to squander too much.
Cause there are a lot of lessons
learned and there's going
to be a lot of frustrations.
There's imposter syndrome.
There's fear and uncertainty there.
You want to make sure you have
some help as you move through that.
Henry Suryawirawan: You mentioned that
it's very critical to have mentors.
So when I look back to my career,
when I made this transition,
I didn't have mentor per se.
So it's more like winging it, maybe.
Maybe reading books or consuming
whatever resources that you could find.
But I think having that
mentor could really help
accelerate that process, right?
So that you are not stuck in the
loop of fear or imposter syndrome,
like you mentioned, or maybe
sometimes you're just clueless.
What should I do?
Because you're dealing with a totally
different kind of a challenge altogether.
And letting go is one part
that, I think, many people who
will transition from individual
contributor to manager suffers a lot.
So maybe is there any specific technique?
How can we embrace this letting go?
How can individual contributor start
shifting their mind towards more
enabling, growing people, improving
process and things like that?
Jeff Perry: Yeah, it's a great question.
So, this is the foundation of a lot
of the shifts that I try and coach
people through, is identifying like,
okay, that's not just a prescription
of techniques that we want to give
you, like, okay, take these actions.
But for you, you need to first
identify what are the mindsets or
beliefs that you're hanging on to.
It's almost like an anchor
that's kind of weighing you down.
We need to identify that first from
the belief or mindset side of things,
and then we can move through processes.
There's a really great process
that I love from a book.
It's called "Immunity to Change", by
a couple of Harvard psychologists,
and I love the framework in
here because it's a process that
engineers can really understand.
Hey, we're identifying a change.
We move through essentially experiments
and tests to identify, okay.
Here's the level of belief
that is driving my behavior.
Well, I need to identify and move
through some experiments and collect
data to challenge these beliefs.
If I can move through that process,
then suddenly the power that belief
and mindset have on me starts to
diminish because the experiences I'm
having are telling me that what I
thought was true, isn't actually true.
It diminishes that and suddenly
we're shifting the mindset that
driving a new set of behaviors
that we're trying to have.
Because the end goal, the behavior
shift, it's pretty easy to outline what
that looks like, in terms of delegate,
trust, don't micromanage, all that sort
of stuff, not that hard to identify.
But how I, as an individual,
move through that process.
That's going to be different
because it may be different things
that I'm struggling with to let go
than you would, or someone else.
It's really identifying that
deeper level mindset and
belief that is holding us back.
There's this process.
You can go to the book or certainly
reach out to me and we can talk more
about what that would look like to
really move through that process.
It's amazing when people would do that.
Like, I had an engineering
leader that I worked with.
He was kind of notorious for just
kind of taking it all on his own.
Really struggled with, if I don't
do it, it's not going to be done
because he was really closely
connected to customer projects
and things with what he was doing.
And so, we worked together on this and
identified how to run some experiments
and things, enhance some things off.
And he's like, you know what?
We started this new project, and I
started it off with someone on my
team to really take ownership of that.
Three months ago, I wouldn't
have ever been able to do that.
I wouldn't have been able to trust that
and I wouldn't have had that set up.
So it was amazing and they're
doing a great job with it.
So a huge shift and it's freeing up
his time to work on the more strategic
areas that are important to him.
And so that's just one example there when
we can make that shift from his beliefs.
He's not tied down by that as much.
Now we're moving on to other things
that we're working on together.
Henry Suryawirawan: That
sounds really powerful.
So first identifying
your mindset and belief.
Old mindset and beliefs that you
probably are not productive in that
sense, if you stay on that zone.
So I think as in any kind of change,
either it's habit, it's a personal
development, identifying mindset
first, I think, is the key for many
kinds of transformative experience.
So I think partly by becoming a more
effective leader, it's also about changing
your mindset and beliefs from IC mode to
a more management and leadership role.
If there are some kind of attributes
that leaders should have, maybe if
you can give some tips for people
here who just made that transition, or
who are still clueless and don't have
mentors, what will be that attributes?
What do they need to look at?
And maybe just practical tips for them.
Jeff Perry: Yeah.
So from an attribute, one of the
things that's really important to me
and something that I've been working
on the last few years, since I got
into this coaching and training role.
So the idea of seeing people as people.
That sounds really simple,
but it's extremely powerful.
I first learned it from a group that
did some training called the Arbinger
Institute, and they talked about a
mindset idea called the outward mindset.
It's this idea of we can see people
as people, whereas the opposite of
that they called inward, self-focus
where you see people as objects.
Maybe to use them as vehicles, or maybe
they're obstacles in your way and so
you just need to get them out of the
way, or maybe they're just irrelevant.
You don't care about them.
But it's this idea of like really
seeking to understand what people need.
What's important to other people?
What they're trying to
accomplish their objectives?
What their challenges are that
they're being faced with when
you can truly understand people?
When you're thinking about from
a leadership perspective, both
on your team also with the peers
that you're working with and also
thinking maybe up in terms of what
do your leaders really need from you?
And really seeking to ask questions
to understand how do you deliver
the greatest impact to these people?
And seeking to not just be held
accountable to that, but seeking to
be proactively accountable for you
in actively checking in with them.
Hey, how am I actually
doing and delivering?
Am I helping you in the
ways that you need that?
And always seeking for that
growth opportunity and feedback.
Then suddenly, everyone around you becomes
kind of a mentor, and that opportunity
to give you insights and feedback that
you might not otherwise be able to know.
Because sometimes we're so afraid, as new
leaders, and experienced leaders even,
of what are people thinking about me?
And we're so afraid of our image.
We can let go of that, and say, "Hey, I
want to understand that because then I can
actually deliver better and put myself out
there and be a better professional, better
person for them that they need me to be."
Then we can make those changes.
So from a fundamental principle
standpoint, this idea of seeing people
as people and seeking to understand
what they need from you will allow
you to be the best that you can.
So stay humble and teachable
and open to those ideas.
Instead of, again, you don't
want to be driven by fear.
You want to be driven by how can
I continue to improve and grow
and see those gaps that you might
have in where you're at now, as
opportunities rather than knocks on you.
We all have things that we can work on.
Well, that's an opportunity to
grow and develop in a new way.
So get excited about that.
Henry Suryawirawan: So I
like the way you frame it.
See people as people, and
also try to understand them.
So I think some people also refer
this to probably like servant leaders.
Your job is there to serve people.
It's not to give orders.
It's not to give a high-level
goals, directions, or maybe
chasing people for tasks.
So I think the key here
is about serving people.
By understanding them, hopefully they can
grow and also be more productive and also
create a great team and a high spirit.
I think that's the message here.
So, part of your day-to-day
is also hosting podcast.
Tell us more about your podcast.
What is it about?
And where people can find it and
why they should check it out?
Jeff Perry: Yeah.
So the podcast is called the
Engineering Career Coach podcast.
And this is a podcast that I
am the primary host right now.
It's in partnership with a group called
the Engineering Management Institute
that I've been able to partner with.
The podcast itself has been
around since, I think, 2013.
But I've been the host for
the last couple of years.
Put out a couple episodes a month,
typically, across all sorts of different
things in terms of engineering, career
opportunities and success from, Hey, how
do you deal with things as an introvert?
We talk about mindset principles.
We talk about leadership.
We talk about changes in engineering and
technical education and things like this.
There's all sorts of different
things we get to bring in experienced
guests on to provide insights.
But it truly meant to be general
across engineering disciplines,
not specific to a few.
Although there's a lot of people
and things in the software world
that people can get insights on.
We try and make things as
applicable as we possibly can
across engineering disciplines.
Because everyone has goals and
things that they're trying to do
and accomplish in their careers.
And so, we want to give people
that resource to help and progress.
That's what it's all about.
So you can find that on any
podcast platform pretty much,
and also YouTube videos as well.
Henry Suryawirawan: So I look
at the number of episodes.
There are plenty of resources.
So if people really want to look at the
career coach angle, there are plenty of
episodes that probably you can look at.
Sometimes when you navigate in a
certain situation, when you don't
have mentors, it's really hard.
So looking at those previous episodes,
I think probably can help you as well.
Not to mention that podcasts, or
maybe YouTube, now have become
one of the mentors in life.
If you don't know about something, search
on podcasts, YouTube or books, and then
you try to self-serve yourself by having
these kinds of electronic mentors.
So Jeff, it's been a pleasant
conversation with you about career
coach, leadership, career transitions.
But we need to wrap up.
Before I let you go, normally I have
one last question that I always ask for
all my guests, which is this question
about three technical leadership wisdom.
Maybe you can give us some advice
from your experience, from your
journey, what will be your three
technical leadership wisdom, Jeff?
Jeff Perry: Yeah.
So the first one that I would share
is to be proactive, not reactive.
We've talked about this in terms of
being intentional and deliberate in your
career, but just like, identify what
you want to do and go make that happen.
Recognize that, Hey, there's going to
be some twists and turns along the way.
You can see every step as another
prototype and an opportunity
like data and things like this.
It's just another iteration.
So don't get too discouraged if you're not
exactly where you want to be right now.
But how can you take ownership
and be proactive with where you
want to continue to go and how
you want to continue to grow?
Number two is tap into and
become aware of your mindsets.
Not just the actions you want to
take, but who you want to become.
Like it really starts there.
When we talked about some of the ways,
you can actually go about running
experiments or tests to identify
those mindsets might be holding you
back and move through that process.
But, again, the principle is
that mindsets drive behavior.
Our behavior drives our results.
And so, if we just prescribe behaviors,
we're not going to make sustainable
changes to get the results we want.
We need to change our mindset, which then
drives our behaviors, which then drives
our new results that we're looking for.
We're really trying to
improve and grow our lives.
And then number three is, I'd
say, get help and support.
Get mentors and coaches like those
digital things, resources like podcasts
that we have and books and articles.
Fabulous, absolutely engage and find
the things that are great for you.
But also invest in yourself.
Get this relationship base that
can really get personalized.
You are your greatest asset in
your career and in your life.
So protect that, grow that, invest in
that, like you would invest in financial
investments, but invest in you personally
in your growth, physically, mentally
professionally, and all areas of life.
You'll be glad that you did because
you're trying to live your best life.
So you got to invest in
you to make that happen.
A lot of times, coaches, mentors
and other things can help you
accelerate that process and make
even more progress than you need to.
So be proactive, tap into those mindsets
and invest in yourself and get some help.
Henry Suryawirawan: I
really love the last one.
You mentioned about we as
our own greatest asset.
So sometimes we neglect our career.
Although we spend more of our
life doing our career, right?
Your hours as well.
But sometimes we don't
invest too much in it.
We just go with the motion and make
decisions, maybe sometimes thought
about it, but maybe not enough.
So the key here is try to invest in
ourselves, find mentors and support.
So thank you so much, Jeff,
for all those wisdoms.
