Hey everyone, my name is Heidi.
I recruit Product Managers and I am super
pumped to be chatting today
with my friend Handika
Handoko. I'm going to
let him introduce himself
because I want you to hear
his story today. So, Handika
tell us about where you work, what
you do and what you're solving for today.
Thanks very much Heidi
for considering me and actually taking
the time to have a chat with me.
Like Heidi said, Heidi
and I go quite way back from a professional
relationship first and then kind of moving on to
a more personal relationship as
a friend now. So my name is, Handika.
I currently work as a Vice
President of Software Engineering for
Broadridge Financial solutions - it's a global
fintech leader. I work
for a Canadian business unit where
we cater to Canadian
independent brokerage. So
think of the solution that we're doing
as a brokerage in a box. So
if you ever in your lifetime want
to, hey, maybe it's cool to open up a brokerage
firm, you come to us and we'll set you up with everything
that you need from front to back
end. Well, I'm talking
in tech tech lingo, but I feel
like from front office to back office
a from a brokerage operations perspective.
So that's kind of what my title
and what I'm doing and where I'm working at.
Currently, I'm focused on
things that is
what everyone else in the space
is focusing on. Kind of modernizing our tech
stack while at the same time trying
to keep lights on, making sure that
our clients are able to service
their clients, their investors to
reach their life goals. So that's
kind of what we're trying to do in our day to
day in our work.
Really mission critical, you know
enterprise software.
One of the reasons
I was so excited to chat with you today
is because you have a fascinating
career where,
you have been a very successful
product management leader.
You were in product for
the majority of your career and
then you made the decision
to pivot into engineering
and so much of what we do in our product
practice is working
with Product Managers also working with
engineering leaders as well.
And there's such an interesting relationship
between these two critical
functions of a software vendor. I'm
curious what led you to making
the decision to move out
of product and into
an engineering role?
So for my case, I think
that's not a very complicated
answer Heidi. If
you look at my my career I did start
as a Developer, I did
start as a Programmer. So I've got my roots
in programming and I've always had the
thinkering for technology. I've always
kept myself up to date with advancements
in technologies like advances
in Blockchain. I'm trying to dabble
in crypto space, advancements
in AI. So, those are just
fascinating things and I think people
in the product space, they're most
likely familiar with that venn diagram where as a product
person you got that intersection
between knowing the business, knowing the technology
and knowing the UX - knowing the customer
experience. right? So it's all so
intertwined with each other and
once you're in the product space or the technology
space - the
lines do get blurred at some time.
And so for me I think I have the advantage
and the benefit of knowing about
the space, knowing about the technology, knowing
about the business. So I'm more
easily adaptable and when
the opportunity comes and shows up
which in life it is
rare opportunity.
It came I feel like I could do
a big contribution
in the department. I could deliver value in
that. That's why I made the jump back
to my roots if you will, into
technology.
You sort of hinted there a little bit about
how your career as a Product Manager
really helps your career
now as a Vice President of Engineering.
Maybe expand on that a little bit more. How do you
find product management skills
translate into being a more effective
Vice President of Engineering?
Yeah absolutely. I think in the product
management space you're definitely exposed
more into the business side of things.
I like to think of all of
us in the workspace are really working towards
solving a big puzzle.
The more different roles that you've
been in the space, in the organization,
the better idea of a puzzle
that you're trying to solve
My knowledge in product management
I think really helped me to look
at things from a business/ revenue/ client
experience side of things. Like on the
technology side of things back
then, like it was, oh, shiny new
technology, let's go at it, let's
give it a try, let's do it. And I think
we still do that, we still experiment,
we still innovate that way. But in terms
of
making it go-to-market,
that's when I think,
the things that you learn from product management,
product marketing really comes into play.
Like, do we have a competitive
edge there? What is the value prop we're trying to deliver?
What is the problem we're trying to solve?
I think that being
in product for so long, that's been ingrained
in me that that's always the things
that I ask whenever we try to do things
and also helps with
technology right now when I hear from
my people, hey, there's this new technology
that we want to try this is
something cool that we want to play
with. I can associate that with
what clients have been saying, what the market's been
saying, what the business needs. And I could more easily
tie them back, hey, we want to
achieve this goal for our clients, for our business
and this is the technology that we think
can support that or would be the most
efficient solution to achieve that. So I think
that's kind of like how I would say
it has helped me, it helps me complete the picture,
it helps me to see the bigger picture
And I could kind of put every little
pieces if you will, and make
the perfect solution.
Very well said, I I love that.
It gives you the chance to really see that bigger picture,
which is so critical when you're, when you're a business
leader as you are now as a Vice President of Engineering.
A lot is
said and talked about regarding the relationship
and what a healthy relationship might look
like between a product org and an engineering
org. I think back to some of
the searches that we've had, where
our clients will tell us, hey,
this has largely been an engineering
led business and we're
trying to move
it closer towards being product-led
or some other stakeholders might
joke around and say, oh the
engineers, it's all about them and they're
building whatever they want.
That product is trying to
move that towards
what the customer wants and what
what can be monetized.
How do you define the
healthy... a healthy relationship
between engineering and product? What
does that look like? How might one
move closer towards healthy relationships?
I think you gotta start with respect.
I think each side needs to respect
what they bring to the table. I know again,
like going back to that venn diagram, I think everyone
in this space be, you're more technology
centric or more product centric, they
oftentimes they have similar skill sets,
similar background. So one
might think that they know more
than the other. But then
we've got our own swim
lanes to be kind of like...
how to make this happen.
So, I think that mutual respect
is really crucial to
a healthy relationship.
A firm, a startup
like you said, may start from an engineering
centric kind of position because
that is what
helped them cement their position
in the market. They built something
that solves the problem and then as
they grow, they do
need that product management rigor
if you will, in terms of trying
to build a project, building that product
now, not building a project.
Trying to build something that address
a larger market, address
a segment that actually
you build it once and you serve
a lot of people or you solve a lot of problems
multiple times. That's kind of like
what product is there
to do in terms of rigor. So I think
technology and product again, they
gotta have that mutual respect. They got
to understand that, yes, the
guy that's leading technology
may come from a product background. So
they may say things about product, but again
we've got the dedicated product and likewise,
the product person may come
from an engineering background and they may think, oh, this
one's easy, you just do that. Because
of that, I think that's where things
get a little bit unhealthy, where you say that
I could do whatever you are
doing more easily. So that's where things
break down I find. So appreciate
respect and appreciate what each other
has to say and kind of marching towards
the same goal. We are all working towards
solving problems, delivering value,
making sure that our customers
or users have a delightful experience.
I love how
you summarized what you just said and
how you phrased it - tell me if I got
this right - build it once
and then solve for many people
over time.
Yes, exactly
Beautiful.
If you think about
Vice Presidents of Product
and that persona
of individual in a software company,
what might they not understand
about the role of
a VP of Engineering
and
perhaps the struggle or
the challenges that you're facing
that might benefit them to to have some
visibility into?
Yeah. So I was
thinking about that and I think one of the
challenges I think
I face is that, in my
day to day dealings, I deal
with all of my engineers
who have aspirations,
who wants to make sure
they're not getting obsolete from a tech
perspective, like in terms of
what we use and what they want to learn.
I have to find
that delicate balance between making
sure that they're happy, they're growing,
they're learning what they want. First is meeting
the business needs, which typically comes
from product, that we need to build it this way,
or we need to build in this technology
kind of thing that helps answer
whatever client needs. So sometimes
those demands comes from. Sometimes
that becomes a point
of friction between us and saying
my set of people here. Yes, I know
they have this technology
under their belt.
They know about this but they want to start
to learn about new things. They want to start to
learn about new technology. So, I'd like
to invite you to maybe take
a risk and let's try this out.
Then maybe we embrace a little bit of an agile
methodology where let's give
it a try, if it doesn't work, let's fail fast and
and pivot. So I think that's
the part that maybe...
not to say that the leaders
of product are heartless and they don't care about people.
They do but they just I think they're closer
to different aspects of the business and that's where
their interests are but for me, my
heart and my interest is always with my people
and making sure that they're as happy as they can,
so they can unleash their potential. And
that's where the friction comes, to
balance, making sure they
they get what they need vesus
what we need to deliver to our clients.
Beautiful.
Let's end with some advice.
Let's think about
the Product Manager in the market today
or the the product leader
who at this
time in the market, there's so much hype
around getting into product. It feels like everyone's,
taking courses and classes and workshops
and they're writing books and everything is
about getting into product. Yet,
there's a lot of folks out there who feel
the pull
to more of the engineering
side for different reasons
and maybe opportunities are
opening up for them on the engineering side,
but they're questioning might that be
the right move for me? What advice
would you have for someone who's trying
to kind of weigh those pros and
cons and think about whether that could be,
a great career move for them?
Yeah, based on
my history. It's a little bit more
difficult for me to kind of summarize
what advice would I give to
people in that situation because my
background it was easy for me because I was
pretty much in both walls most
of the time. But for people
that are like right now solely in product and they
want to think about stepping outside.
I think
a good advice would be that
they look themselves in the mirrors and
look at what they bring right now. What
is the asset that they have right now?
I think it's always good to
inventorise that and making
sure that you own that and you know what you
bring to your table. So that when
you do want to try to embrace
other stuff, you know that what
you could lean on and you know how you could
compensate for what you don't know yet
and what you're looking to learn with what
you're good at. So when you
join a different team or a different
organization,
you know that yeah, you're not great in that
technology side yet, but you're compensating
with what you bring in the table
from your past experience.
So I think that's one advice and the
other advice is to start
joining different groups. Like I know
you and your firm
created that or help with the Toronto Product
Management Association, so that's one organization.
And I'm sure if there's a product
person with that sort of thought, there's gonna be
more than,
that one product person with that sort of some
sort of thought. So gather
much, talk to other people
that are like minded and
kind of figure out, how are you
tackling this problem? How are you
kind of like trying to discover
yourself? I think that's kind of part of your
question, right? And I think that
the last advice I would give is that like in
the in the past I was interested in consulting,
but like for me to go into consulting,
nobody's gonna hire me...
So I actually try to find
pro bono opportunity to
to try out consulting
and see whether that is something I would want
to do and maybe get my
my foot in the door of consulting firms.
So
that's what I did to try
to expose myself, to try
to learn and discover myself - is that what I want
to do? And to know more people.
So to summarize,
take a look at your adventure of
assets, join clubs,
meet ups and whatever groups
that you have with like minded people
or maybe venture up to like a purely
technological group see like
do you gel with the people?
It's the dymanics too, right?
Like if you gel with the people, you've got chemistry,
a lot of problems, you can solve that.
And the last thing, try volunteering.
I know there's a lot of nonprofit that look
for people with... maybe they need help building a
website. I know in what we do,
technology is different, but depending
on the spectrum of the product person, right? That might
be where you start.
Super advice. Thank you so much.
Always a pleasure, Handika. Always a pleasure
chatting with you. Thank you so much for the investment
of your time
to share your insights with our community
and thank you. Thank you again.
Yeah, feeling is mutual Heidi.
Always great to chat with you.
