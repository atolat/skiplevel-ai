I wanted to pursue the role of a project
manager or a business analyst. So that's
how I see myself. So with my learnings from
the software engineering course about managing
the software team and knowing how to build the
software process, I think I'm really excited when
I start my career that I can be a great product
manager or business analyst and help build teams
that can develop or produce great technology
products. And also the kind of content that
we learned in so far in Software Engineering is
very relatable to the practical experience that
we are going to have in the future in the software
industry. So yeah, it was really great so far.
