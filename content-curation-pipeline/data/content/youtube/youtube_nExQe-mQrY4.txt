Let me tell you how I was promoted to a Director 
of Engineering. Before that I was working as a  
team lead, focusing on quality testing and best 
practices and trying to have impact across the  
company, making teams aligned on how we do things. 
My team was known to be collaborative, fast and  
reliable. When a new VP was hired he quickly 
saw my potential and offered me a promotion!
