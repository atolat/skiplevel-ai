Hey everyone, welcome
back to the channel.
Today we're going to be talking about
the big leap in many tech careers.
This week for me was
feedback review week.
And that means I gave a lot of feedback
and I get to review the
performance of my team members
from the beginning of the
year to the end of the year.
And for some people
that came with a promotion,
which means the next step.
Hopefully as a manager,
you started preparing your
team members for the next step
and the leadership roles
they're about to take in
long before performance
review results are out.
Today's video is going
to focus on transitioning
from a software engineer to a manager.
It's an exciting journey,
but it comes with its
own set of challenges.
If you're considering or
already in this transition,
stick around because today
we're going to be looking
at some of the hurdles you might face
when transitioning from
an individual contributor
to a manager.

One of the first
challenges everyone faces,
even I when I
transitioned eight years ago
is mindset shift.
As a software engineer,
your success is
measured by the code you write,
the bugs you fix and the
features that you deploy.
But as an engineering
manager, that changes.
You're measured by how much you enable
your team to succeed
and create an environment
where people can thrive and grow.
Instead of solving problems directly,
your role is to create an environment
where other people can solve problems.
This requires taking a step back,
trusting your team and
focusing on high level priorities
like morale,
productivity, and most importantly,
ensuring that your team aligns with
company's objectives.
A tip I usually give
new engineering managers
is to embrace the idea
that your role is no longer
to be the best individual contributor
or write the best code,
but to build the best team.

A lot of challenges let's involve coding.
If you've spent years
as a software developer,
chances are you love writing code.
But as a manager, you're
going to write less of it
or even none at all.
This can be tough because it feels like
you're stepping away
from what you're good at.
But remember, your technical
experience gives you an edge.
It helps you understand
your team's challenges.
It helps you make informed decision
and most importantly,
communicate effectively
with both engineers and stakeholders.

One of the biggest hurdles in
management is communication.
Now you're the bridge between your team
and other departments
like product, leadership,
or even clients depending on
the industry where you work.
Miscommunication can
lead to unclear priorities,
missed deadline, or even
worse, team frustration.
One thing you might want to do
is regular check-ins with the team.
This should be on a cadence.
Use one-on-ones with
team members to build trust
and understand their challenges.
Also, be the type of manager
who over-communicates when needed.
It is better to clarify than to assume.

Another challenge as a manager is
balancing priorities.
As a manager, your time
is split between meetings,
planings, coaching the team, and
sometimes putting out fires.
It's easy to be overwhelmed.
A tip I have for you
is learning to delegate.
Your team members are there to help
execute the technical work while you
handle the higher level priorities.
Use tools like task boards
or project management tools
like Jira, Asana, or ClickUp.
These can help you track progress
and ensure that you focus on priorities.

Becoming a manager is
not just about managing.
It's about leading.
You're now responsible for your team's
growth and motivation.
This means you'll be providing feedback,
recognizing
achievements, and sometimes having
very difficult conversations.
My tip here is not underestimate the
importance of empathy.
Listen to your team's
concerns, support their career goals,
and most importantly,
celebrate successes.
Being approachable will
end their trust and respect.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
To wrap it up,
transitioning from a software developer
to an engineering manager is challenging,
but incredibly rewarding.
Remember these key points.
Shift your mindset from
individual contributor
to an enabler.
Let go of code.
Your focus is on your team now.
Communication is your superpower.
Practice it daily.
Learn to prioritize
and delegate effectively.
Be a leader, not a manager.
Empathy goes a long way.
