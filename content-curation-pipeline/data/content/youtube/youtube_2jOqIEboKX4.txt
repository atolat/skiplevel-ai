from the ashes of my career burnout a single
question arose within me how does one raise
like a phoenix to join the top one person of
software engineers driven by that spark I kept
searching until I found a Reddit post that
was really interesting and finally answered
my question i read through every suggestion and
comment on that thread and here is what I learned
so the first comment that took my eye was this one
forget work life balance only perfection matters
to be honest at first I thought why should I burn
out myself to make someone else richer but more
I thought about it it it rang more true and the
thing is to crack to the top one person you need
to sacrifice you cannot go to your job at 9 and
leave at 5 and when you are at home or through
weekend don't touch your laptop and expect to go
among the one person because there is definitely
someone who is um grinding through dinner coding
past midnight and spending weekends learning a
new tool and that guy is the one that is going
to leave you behind i know it sound harsh but
believe me guys it's the plain truth to join the
top one person you need to step out your comfort
zone you need to work hard and let the hard work
carry you forward another comment that also cuts
straight to the chase is this one if you lack
ambition you are just a puppet at first it it
feels like the guy is insulting but the more you
think about it more you see the truth hard work
without a goal is just busy work you need a fire
inside you you need a clear burning aim you can't
ignore without that drive even the best routines
lose their spark and everything falls apart
so let's go to the other brilliant comments 95%
hard work 5% talent um there is a cold reality
no amount of coffee will turn a potato into a
ferrari if your brain is stuck in reverse you
will never outrun someone born with that spark if
you are not smart then it's like showing up to a
drag race with a tricycle then you will eat dust
every time to be in top one person you need that
genetic you need to be smart maybe you are talking
about top 10 top 25 top 20 person then hardboard
would be enough but believe me guys if you want
to be among top one person then you need to be
talented but let's pause for a moment if you are
still watching this video and still you haven't
hit the like button please do that because that
is the thing that keeps the fire inside me turn
so if you do that I would be really really happy
and you are doing something really really good for
me we want to create a good community here we
want to grow we want to grow together so let's
let's keep it running guys the other comment
that also um caught through my eyes is this guy
who is talking about luck um I really believe in
luck i have a friend who is a DevOps vizard but
he's always stuck in interviews because he cannot
explain himself and I know another guy named Chad
and this chart crushed the production a couple
of times but he has a six figure salary because
his cousin is the CTO of the company i mean these
things are the reality of life yeah you need luck
definitely you need luck without luck you cannot
uh get through the top person or work into the
to the best companies i also love this one who
is talking about consistency don't plateau once
you've learned enough to get paid i've seen many
many brilliant engineers sticking to their comfort
zone while the real elite always keep pushing they
seek tougher problems they learn new languages and
familiar architectures and bonus tip never be the
smartest person in the room i mean if you're in
a team and you are the smartest guy there then
you have a problem you won't learn there try to
surround yourself with people who are smarter
than you and who can challenge you on a daily
basis so I also love this one some people claim
that the top devs are lone wolf nerds robots who
live in cold caves or you know people like you
cannot communicate with them but I I see this as
a joke to be honest i believe if there is a guy
you cannot talk with then that guy cannot crack
to the top one person you know nobody wants to
per program with a brick ball soft skill aren't
optional guys soft skills are very very important
you need to learn to translate your genius into
plain English you need to build relationship you
need to sell your ideas otherwise you will just
be the smartest mute person in the room and you
would never go through the top one person i also
like this comment it has some cool points you
need to embrace change and he is also talking
about Uncle Bob's clean code like the the the
book that says the method should be under 20
lines which is stupid in my opinion the book that
says you should never uh repeat yourself i mean
but but that one is also not very true sometimes
um repeating yourself is better than creating a
lot of abstraction inheritance and different stuff
and make your code more and more complicated just
to just because you don't want to repeat yourself
i mean code is a living thing it's like a monster
that you need to tweak it you need to smash it
you need to rewrite it every day and and you
know any rule that shows up and it slows down
you through that process you need to break it
because you need to be open to change your code
you should not look at your code like a piece of
art that that that is in the I mean you should be
always open to learn something new and change your
code and if you want opportunity to to uh learn
more just dive into open source projects there
are a lot of real bugs and people there give you
brutal feedback and you can have some real growth
there there are some projects some crazy project
like Apache Kapka you can contribute in them and
you can learn a lot really top one person
developers are working there and you can go
among them you know there is no filter you can go
among them you can uh choose uh choose the issue
