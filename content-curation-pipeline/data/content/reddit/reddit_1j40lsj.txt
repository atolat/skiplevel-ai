# Stuck in a High-Paying Tech Job I Hate – Need Career Advice!

Hey everyone,  

I really need some guidance, and I figured this is the best place to get honest advice.  

 *My Background:* 
- I’m 22, from India, and a *Computer Engineering graduate*.  
- I got a *campus placement* in a tech company with a *12 LPA salary* (which is considered great for a fresher).  
- I’ve been working here for *7 months now*.  

*The Problem:*
- I *absolutely hate coding*. Like, every single day, I dread my work.  
- I’ve realized I enjoy *managing, organizing, planning, and leading teams* rather than writing code.  
- I love *interacting with people, making presentations, and taking charge* of projects.  
- But in my current role, it’s just *coding all day*, and I feel like I’m suffocating.  

 *The Dilemma:*
- When I tell people I want to switch careers, they say,  
  - *"You’re just a fresher, every job is boring at first!"*  
  - *"Give it more time, don’t rush!"*  
  - *"You’re lucky to have a 12 LPA package, don’t throw it away!"*  
- I get their point, but deep down, I feel like *this field is just not for me*.  
- The biggest fear? What if I *jump into another field and realize later that I hate that too?* I don’t want to make another mistake.  

 *Options I’m Considering:*
I’ve been researching career paths that *align with my strengths (management, planning, leadership, communication)* and found these options:  
1. *HR (Human Resources)*– Talent acquisition, employee engagement, etc.  
2. *Marketing & Brand Management* – Digital marketing, PR, product marketing, etc.  
3. *Operations & Strategy* – Project management, business operations, consulting.  
4. *Event Management*– Corporate events, weddings, brand activations, etc.  
5. *MBA (CAT/MBA CET)*– To transition into a business/management role.  

What I Need Advice On:
- Am I *rushing my decision*, or is it valid to want a change?  
- Has anyone here successfully *switched from tech to HR, Marketing, or Ops*? How was the experience?  
- Would an *MBA be a good choice*, or are there better ways to transition?  
- Any other career options I should explore based on my skills and interests?  

I would *genuinely appreciate* any insights or personal experiences! I don’t want to feel lost anymore. Thanks in advance!

Ride it out for a few months longer and then try to transition to a BA or SA route.

Stay with your firm and aim to get a managerial position within a year. Prepare simultaneously for CAT/GMAT/Other Bschool admission exams.

With 2-3 years work experience in tech, coupled with a managerial role, you'll be in a good position to get mid management positions in industry after completing a 1-2 year MBA program from those schools.

But I dont like what I am doing right now and MBA is kind of an experiment I’m doing to explore and find my interests although I like doing management roles.
