# Is moving to a Research Engineer position a career setback?

I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer in a high-stress, no work-life balance (WLB) environment (working 12 hours a day and sometimes on weekends) and have been experiencing several burnouts. I have received an offer for a Senior Research Engineer position from research institute, which offers good WLB and involves interesting work in machine learning research, an area I am interested in. I also want to pursue more specialized work rather than continue with the repetitive tasks of my current software engineering role.

In terms of compensation, there is about a 60k paycut. I would like to get insights from people who are currently working as Research Engineers because I am quite indecisive about what to do. should I take the pay cut and engage in more interesting work with better WLB, or should I chase the money?

In terms of career growth, can I transition back to the industry in more specialized areas of work? Also, I am completing my master degree around end of this year.

How does 60k affect your lifestyle? If you’re making 100k now, then 60k is a lot. If you’re making 500k, then 60k isn’t too big of a hit. If you’re getting burnt out, I feel like the research institute seems like a great move

It seems like my career is going down the path of being a swe on research teams. Did an internship in college for an r&d team, worked in an applied ml lab in college, first job has been on an ml team in fintech, started applying around a bit this year and my only two call backs were from reality labs research and amazons new agi lab. I like it because I don’t have to deal with as many product people and people doing research generally didn’t just get into cs for the paycheck, even if they’re comp chasers at this point in their career. Also, the people I’ve worked with have always been the smartest, most educated and highest paid people at the company so it’s been nice

If you are working 12 hours a day now, and 8 hours a day at the new job, it would be rational to switch jobs for a 33% paycut.  You would be making the same on an hourly basis.  You might even be willing to take a bigger cut for reasonable hours.

Your mental and physical health should be your top priority. I would have left that place a long time ago... unless you are making crazy money and you're close to retirement.
