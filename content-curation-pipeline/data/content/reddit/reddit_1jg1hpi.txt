# Move to Java backend or DevOps for career growth?

I’m a Node.js backend developer (2 YOE) with PostgreSQL and MongoDB. For career growth, should I learn Java Spring Boot to join big company’s dev teams or focus on DevOps for higher pay and less saturation? Given that companies hire more developers than DevOps engineers, but DevOps roles pay better, which is the smarter choice? Also, does being from a third world country (Indian subcontinent) impact this decision?

But from my experience, devops is a lot more firefighting; if you can handle the stress of unexpected outages and pressure to fix things asap then go for it

I already am doing deployment tasks in my office since I’m the one in charge of running the backends that I write. Wrote some database backup scripts. Auto git pull and restart when repo pushed etc. So yeah I can feel the stress it creates when unexpected downtime happens.

Java Spring Boot is essential for big company roles, but DevOps offers higher pay and less competition. Decide based on where you see long-term growth.

Hope devops doesn’t get saturated like web dev anytime soon.

How will you focus on DevOps? Like side projects or what?

Yes, currently got oracle free vm and aws free tier so I was thinking about learning something new in my free time.

DevOps if you can. Competition is the same as java dev because devops has less saturation but also less competition and with java dev there is more competition and more saturation. I would argue getting a java job is harder. You will be up against 20 devs gunning for one job and while there are less devops jobs, you probably only competing against several others and also the pay is higher

But also fewer roles / positions, correct?

What are you more interested in? What’s your stress tolerance? Do you like working in Java (I.e. will you want to blow your brains out after a few weeks/months)?

Both are solid options. Pick whatever’s right for you, nobody on the internet knows better.

Senior Java dev here. I recommend learning React and becoming a Full-stack dev. So many startups and products have open positions for React + Node.js that I am thinking about learning that stack too.
