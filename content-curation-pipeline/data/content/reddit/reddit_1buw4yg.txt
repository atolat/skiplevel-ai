# How much is a raise to Senior Software Engineer?

I’m a software engineer with 3 years experience. I might get a promotion to Senior Software Engineer but I’m wondering what is the common percentage raise? Would expecting a 25% pay increase be unrealistic? How much was your raise when being promoted to Senior Software Engineer internally? 


This would be an internal promotion at my company.

It super depends on the company. Sometimes you'll get promoted to "Senior" and will get nothing except a new title and more work. If you really want to get raises it's important to change roles every 2 to 3 years to ensure you're getting that 25% increase (or more usually). From my experience internal promotions don't compensate nearly as well as career promotions.

This. Don’t expect too much for internal promotions. I got less than 10%. Changing jobs is the way to get significant raises. And do change jobs every few years, especially earlier in your career. Not just for the money but you also learn more

Yep.  I was just promoted from Sr. to Principal. Title only, no raise other than the yearly "cost of living increase that's less than cost of living".  My boss's boss shook my hand and gave me 3x "fun assignments" the morning I was promoted.

So I'll use the title to GTFO...

I think viewing job hops via percentage-wise increases is less helpful than thinking of them market-wise. You should be looking for whatever the market will bear. Sometimes this means doubling your income if you're on the low end, other times this means a 5% increase if you're lucky on the high end. There's no real force that incentives giving candidates X more than whatever they happened to make at their last job. That's just a psychological game employers use to low-ball people and make candidates think they got good deals.

Depends on the company. Period.

25% in your dreams. The reason people jump they never get a meaningful raise.

#### Reply 1 by u/ZolaThaGod (77 points)

Which is just wild to me. Companies would really rather bring on some new bozo and risk mucking up their systems/codebase, rather than just throw a few extra peanuts at the guy who knows the shit inside and out.

#### Reply 2 by u/whorunit (1 points)

My company goes $248k > $373k for senior

#### Reply 3 by u/PovertyAvoider (-4 points)

Idk, I got a raise from 55k to 85k when I went from junior to intermediate

Title inflation hitting this sub hard 😂

#### Reply 1 by u/cgyguy81 (38 points)

Yeah exactly... Especially for someone with only 3 YOE thinking they're senior.

#### Reply 2 by u/fireheart337 (13 points)

Such a disservice to their growth as an engineer when they jump to a newer/bigger company and the culture shock of not *really* being a senior hits

### Comment 5 by u/Jorixa (28 points)

I got a 12% increase when I got promoted from senior to lead. Then I got 25% increase when switching back to senior but in another company 😀

### Comment 6 by u/Evan-devCheer (59 points)

3 years and you're already being considered for a Senior role? You're either a mastermind or working at a small company! 😁 Typically you see a 10-15% raise for lCoL/mCoL areas.

&#x200B;

The best move for a salary bump is to job hop every 2-3 years and you'll easily get a 20-30% increase.

#### Reply 1 by u/manliness-dot-space (16 points)

I remember back in my day "senior engineer" meant someone with like 15-20 years of experience or more, who was a thought leader.

It's hilarious title bloat IMO. Like instead of "janitor" it's "sanitation engineer" and instead of "secretary" it's "office administrator" and etc. 

0-3 years was basically "you're getting on-the-job training and not useful enough to even break even to the company" when I started. 3-5 years was "actually an engineer" and 5+ was "mid level"... if you really dedicated yourself and pursued additional education you might be considered senior as early as 10 years in, where you would be influencing others and standing out above peers, suggesting decisions and directions and choices for the junior members. 

Maybe next decade "senior engineer" will mean they are a senior in undergrad and "VP engineer" will be the title for those in their first year working.

Tier 2 companies don't have mid levels. It's engineer -> senior engineer

Usually it's 8-15% but like others said it depends on your company.

That’s a nice raise

### Comment 9 by u/[deleted] (10 points)

No way it’s 25% raise

### Comment 10 by u/[deleted] (9 points)

As others have said, very much depends on the company and maybe also what your current salary is. As a rule of thumb, I would never expect a raise of more than 10% for an internal promotion.

### Comment 11 by u/ajtyeh (13 points)

Had to unsub from this sub because of the type of questions asked (this one tipped the scales). 3 years of software engineering experience and you cant figure out that its company dependent and that a simple lookup of common companies on [levels.fyi](http://levels.fyi) would give you an idea, but you had to ask the question here. expect about 50 or 100 downvotes for this, any less and i would be disappointed.

#### Reply 1 by u/Aoratos1 (5 points)

You aren't wrong but you don't sound fun at parties either, anyway, I upvoted in the hopes of disappointing you even further.

### Comment 12 by u/ViveIn (4 points)

25% is very uncommon. During a very low unemployment period you “might” be able to negotiate 20%. But in normal times they’ll offer 10% and you’ll negotiate up to 15%.

### Comment 13 by u/mandaliet (3 points)

There's too much variation between companies to make a useful generalization. At my last company, though, salary brackets were openly published in the employee handbook (and even if they hadn't been, it's easy enough to ask coworkers about what to expect). My raise upon being promoted was less than 10%, never mind 25%!

#### Reply 1 by u/sytem32config (0 points)

If I get 10% raise I’ll definitely be looking for a new job

### Comment 14 by u/doodooz7 (3 points)

You guys are getting raises?

### Comment 15 by u/andrew_kirfman (3 points)

I went from an L2 to an L5 over a period of about 5 years at the same company.  

Each time, I got 10% moving from one level to the next.  

I wouldn’t expect much more than that with an internal move/promotion.  

Hopping companies could get you closer to 25%, but I’d caution you that a senior at company A doesn’t mean the same thing as senior at company B.  You might be in for a bit of a shock if your company considers “senior” a less meaningful title than others.

### Comment 16 by u/PM_Gonewild (5 points)

3 yrs and a senior already?? Mfker there's so much damn variance in titles relative to yrs of experience, unless OP is a genius of course.

NO

### Comment 18 by u/kblaney (2 points)

25% is unrealistically high for being promoted at the same company in most cases.

At the same time, moving companies to get promoted netted me a \~70% increase.

This math is brought to you by the fact that there is a pool of money for hiring and there is a pool of money for raises that are not the same pool. It is easy for a company to justify a salary for a new person because that's the market rate. However, it is hard to justify a 25% raise for an existing employee because it is unlikely that after getting a promotion an employee will be >25% more effective.

### Comment 19 by u/sudden_aggression (2 points)

Generally speaking

If you get promoted internally, the raises will be small. There are exceptions but companies generally don't shower money on people already working there unless you are a superstar and they are really afraid you will leave. 

I would take the promotion and whatever raise you get and wait a little bit before you start putting out resumes with you as senior developer. Probably start looking 6-12 months after promotion?

### Comment 20 by u/13chase2 (2 points)

I got a 23% raise between junior and senior which in 2021 was $18,400 from $80k to $98,400.

#### Reply 1 by u/sytem32config (2 points)

You’re a senior software engineer and your pay is $98,400?

### Comment 22 by u/therealopm (2 points)

Yeah it is unrealistic. Most companies are only going to give you ~15% increase max increase tbh. Expecting more than that is setting yourself up for disappointment imo.

### Comment 23 by u/ghdana (2 points)

Internal promotion maybe 10%, switching jobs the sky is the limit.

### Comment 24 by u/noobsman (2 points)

How do you get an entry level software engineer job first?

#### Reply 1 by u/sytem32config (1 points)

I built a app from scratch and hosted it on Microsoft azure which solved a problem my company was facing and they promoted me to a dev from a non tech role

### Comment 25 by u/xabrol (2 points)

For me it was 50% but I changed jobs to go from mid to senior.

#### Reply 1 by u/sytem32config (2 points)

Sounds like jumping ship is way to go to get the big raises

### Comment 26 by u/siammang (2 points)

Unless this senior level includes some project lead and managerial works, 25% increase might be a stretch. Well.. depending on 25% from what number as well. 25% from 48K is probably reasonable. 25% from 300k is probably unlikely.

To be senior level, it should put you to around 100k - 200k depending on the company salary bands. Some company might not put 3-year work experience in senior level unless you have been making huge impact in every step in those years, though.

FWIW, my promotion to "senior" level was like a 10K. Switching a company after that is the only to get me 20-30% increase. Otherwise, I would have to stay for like 5+ years more and assume the company still do merit base increase at steady rate every year.

Congrats on the promotion but for lead I would think that’s 15% minimum. I’ve never got a “promotion” before so I have no idea what to expect but I thought the pay increases would be much higher

### Comment 28 by u/tippiedog (1 points)

### Comment 31 by u/casual_btw (1 points)

Raises aren’t a big pay % increase, job hopping is the big % increase. Note: this doesn’t include vested stock, stock refreshes, etc. that’s a whole other can of worms.   

Here’s a fun fact to wrap your head around: I used to be an IT recruiter within the cloud (AWS / Azure) space. I placed engineers, specifically swe or infrastructure engineers, and even a niche case of a sales guy with no engineering exp. He was just a good software sales guy with cloud sales experience. Anyways, for each placement I made, we charged our client (the employeer) anywhere from $25k - $40k for the placement. It was all salary or total comp % based, whatever I could negotiate. 

So instead of paying you, the employee who IS TRAINED, has the experience they value, a respetable salary bump to RETAIN you… they instead are willing to risk losing you, and when you do leave and they’re caught with their pants down, they paid me the money that would’ve retained you and in return they got a hire that is not trained with their specific tools (obviously) will take weeks to months to ramp up while collecting a salary and the hire may or may not work out. 

Granted it’s a one time payment but it’s a cycle I always thought was stupid… personally I believe if the employee brings value and that value - their total comp is a net positive then you retain that employee… time is money isn’t it? I believe retain > retrain a new employee given what I said above

### Comment 32 by u/[deleted] (1 points)

Titles don't really mean anything, some layabout at company X might be a senior at company Y, there's no real standardization of job and pay.

&#x200B;

25% for an internal move seems steep to me, but you might as well push for it and see where they'll meet you. If you want a big raise, the better idea is always a different company. If you really like where you're at, you can nearly always come back in a year or two and do the same thing for a lot more than you would have gotten otherwise.

### Comment 33 by u/daddyKrugman (1 points)

25% is too low for a senior promotion raise personally,

### Comment 34 by u/Careful_Ad_9077 (1 points)

Anything less than 30% is ridiculous and is a signal to take the rise, do the job for a few months while you search for a senior position somewhere else.

I once took a 11 k to 17 k raise and it still was not worth it, but I job hopped to a 25k one using that as a base.

### Comment 35 by u/Healthy_Razzmatazz38 (1 points)

I'd say extremely unlikely, but the fact that you have 3yo and your company is promoting you to 'senior' might mean that they view senior as the first promotion for new grads. a 25% raise off a new grad salary isn't that out of line for a dev with 3 years of experience, but definitely on the higher end.

### Comment 36 by u/Remote-Telephone-682 (1 points)

[levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) is what I use for a lot of companies but for small companies they won't have the data. I think most small companies will not be very much but idk.

### Comment 37 by u/Esclamare (1 points)

Depends on your company. If you know your pay band it helps curb your expectation. My jump to Sr would see an increase in about 15-20k comp depending on performance and what not.

### Comment 43 by u/master_mansplainer (1 points)

Promoting to senior within the same company is probably 10-15%. They will usually wait until the normal end of year period which means it also has an inflation bump baked in. So you’re effectively only getting ~5-10% minus any usual merit raise beyond inflation you would normally get without the promotion.

### Comment 44 by u/UnknownEssence (1 points)

I’d say 12-15% is what got.

The raises over time added up a lot more than any single raise I’ve gotten in my career. 

I started at $69k and I’m now at $120k. Been 6 years at 1 company in LCOL (Kansas City). 

People never believe me when I tell them I rent a 2 bedroom house with a garage and fenced yard for $945/month.

### Comment 45 by u/agr5179 (1 points)

Depends on the company but a 25% raise for a promotion is definitely not the norm. At every place I’ve worked, 5-10% is typical. Companies are generally stingy as hell when it comes to giving raises.

### Comment 46 by u/cballowe (1 points)

My personal experience is that it was more like 5-10%. It's really going to depend on the company and the comp structure though. Most companies have overlapping salary bands so someone at the top end of level X is being paid more than the bottom end of level X + 1. The target rates shift with time (based on industry wide salary surveys/location).

I know my company uses something like that where the target at any given time is used for things like hiring and promotion. Comp planning would look at salary relative to the current targets - people below target would get bigger raises than people above target.

The other part is total comp and promotions play out in such a way that salary + bonus for someone about to be promoted  is usually already in line with the next level. (There's a bonus multiplier for performance relative to job level. If you're performing at the next level you get a much larger bonus.) So, you get promoted, salary goes up, but your bonus multiplier goes back to 1 and total comp doesn't grow by that much.

Every company is free to choose their own job titles and give those titles their own definitions and compensation levels. For example, Amazon has job titles such as SDEII (Software Developer Engineer Level II), but that is specific to that company.

  
The title you mention "senior software engineer", every company is free to define that how they choose and set compensation how they choose. Some companies don't even give formal job titles.

  
Bottom line: how much of a raise you get is entirely the choice of your employer.

When you interview new hires, be sure to tell them you're a senior engineer with a total 3 years of experience.

#### Reply 1 by u/CoherentPanda (1 points)

If that dev knows his shit, I don't care if it is 3 or 30.  Some people might have 3 years of experience on paper, but perhaps have years of schooling, personal or open source projects they have contributed to, and perhaps pick up on certain Senior skills and maturity as a dev faster than most.
