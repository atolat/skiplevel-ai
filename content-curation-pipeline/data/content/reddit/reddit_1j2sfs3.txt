# Advice Needed: Transitioning from Senior Developer to leadership

Hi everyone,

I’m a Senior Developer with 10+ years in frontend and full-stack development, and 8 years working in Agile environments. I’ve led teams and collaborated with cross-functional groups, but lately, I’ve felt disconnected from the tech stack and struggled with imposter syndrome. To make matters worse, a senior colleague has been talking behind my back, which has shaken my confidence.

I'm now aiming to transition into a leadership role, like Scrum Master or Project Manager, as I’m more interested in guiding teams and managing processes than hands-on coding. However, my current company is too small for this shift internally.

Has anyone transitioned from a senior dev role to leadership? How did you navigate it, and what steps would you recommend for making this change?

Any advice or experiences would be greatly appreciate. Thanks!
