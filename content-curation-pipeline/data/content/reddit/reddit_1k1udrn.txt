# Which is better for career growth private sector or government Jobs?

I have been working for the government as an engineer for four years. I like my job but am frustrated by the bureaucracy and lack of growth opportunities. Thinking ahead I can't think of a promotion I would want to take, supervisors spend most of there times doing paperwork instead of engineering and get very minimal pay increases. 

Last week I interviewed with a contractor for a new position. Long story short they are offering me a position with a 3% raise (non-negotiable), similar time off, but no sick days (gov offers 4 hours per pay period). Upside is the bonuses and raises are better and there is an 8% 401k match. Should I consider taking the job? will it be better for my career in the long run? I have applied for private sector jobs in the past and been offer similar pay to what I currently make but I haven't taken any offers. would it be better for my career long term to just transition now and get out of the government?

Nobody goes into Gov for growth. They go into Gov for STABILITY. Growth = Private. Stability = Gov. Decide what you want to value and go from there.

Well, there's not as much stability in the US now for government jobs. But in general, yes.

Stability is gone…..at least for now.

Fed gov = no stability.  Run like hell from this

Just a comment but.... You don't really say what you do.  There are shittons of different jobs in gov't.  Some are "same shit, different day" with zero room for growth.  Others are "never the same day twice" and lots of room.  In other words, it's much like the rest of the world; it just pays less but there's (usually) more stability associated with it (not true in recent months, however).

Aside:  I mean, you looking for exciting?  I've a couple of coworkers who - as civilians - ended up getting shot at in a combat zone a few months back.  LOL.  Woohoo!  No dull moments there.

3% increase is nothing...I personally would not take any new job with such a small jump.  

I have been working in both private and government.  Private generally provides more opportunities for capable people because they won't tolerate those incapable.  Government however have a lot of people that are not good at their jobs.  However, capable and smart people can also stand out if they know how to and they may move up quickly too when the timing is right.

gov jobs = security  
private sector = velocity

you’re not stuck—you’re just capped  
if you're already bored, already dreading the promotion path, that’s your cue: time to pivot

the offer isn’t perfect, but it’s a *start*  
you take that role, build some private-sector muscle, then jump again in 12–18 months once you’ve got leverage  
gov experience + private chops = recruiters drool

don’t wait for a 10% raise in 5 years when you can stack 20–30% hops in two  
you’re not leaving stability—you’re buying *options*

Thanks for the response. I think right now I value career growth more than security especially being early career. I like the strategy of jumping jobs but I hear mixed opinions on it, some say it is a bad look others say companies could care less and it is more of a norm than in the past.

You are asking that question now? lol

That’s the beauty of gov job, work life balance, low stress, fair pay, great pension.   Who cares about career growth.  Work to live.  Not live to work.

#### Reply 1 by u/Number_Longjumping (3 points)

That is a good point, the thing is I think I'm at a point in my life where I want to work really hard while I'm at work and really contribute, but I also want that work to count for something. Unfortunately in government high performance doesn't seem to be rewarded and the incentives for hard work aren't three as much.

### Comment 8 by u/Personal-Worth5126 (1 points)

The 3% increase would be an issue for me. If switching companies, that’s your chance to significantly increase your base pay as you can’t bank on bonus or potential increases. And what happens if you’re sick and they don’t offer leave? Do they deduct your pay? That sounds dodgy.

### Comment 9 by u/Smakita (1 points)

3% is a terrible offer. Usually, a job change to a new company offers the biggest pay jump.  At least 10%.  
I'd stay put until something better presents itself. 
Plus corporate life has its own bureaucracy and evil people.  
Be sure you also are completely clear on the new role and you like it.

### Comment 10 by u/BitKey9166 (1 points)

This offer is trash.

Giving up a government job for a private sector gig for a 3% raise and a reduction of benefits (sick days are BIG benefit) would be an instant rejection from me. Every other upside you've listed is them just giving you a "trust me bro" that the shit sandwich is worth eating. Raises in the private sector rarely beat the rate of inflation and bonuses are never guaranteed, forget what the recruiter told you. The common way to get your salary up in the private sector is to job hop every couple years.

The private sector can offer more incentives for high performance, that incentive should start with a compelling offer. This ain't it, you can do so much better than this.

#### Reply 1 by u/Number_Longjumping (1 points)

One thing to mention is that I currently have a 10% incentive pay, due to all the efforts to save money in the government there is a chance the incentive could go away this next year and I would lose 10% of pay, it's not certain but definitely possible.

### Comment 11 by u/Sketch_Crush (1 points)

Work in the private sector for a company that contracts to the government. That's how I started. I worked for a small engineering firm that scored a lot of Navy contracts.

I rarely have any military contracts anymore but I accelerated in my role and joined bigger companies later on.
