# DevOps Engineer vs. Software Engineer: Which Career Path is More Future-Proof?

I’m a software developer with 3 years of experience, and I’m considering shifting into DevOps. However, I’m unsure whether I should completely transition or stick to a software engineering path. Can anyone share insights on the key differences in roles, salaries, and long-term career growth?

If you’re more worried about the salary bands than getting good enough at anything that a company wants to pay you, I suspect you might struggle to keep up.

Never met anyone in the devops game who was able to cope with the stress and constant pain unpicking the shit thrown at us if there wasn’t an intrinsic love of getting to know how something works and fixing it.

If you’re not a tinkerer that likes to see behind the complexity curtain you probably won’t enjoy devops at all, would you prefer a role that pays more that you dislike?

Hi, I've worked 7-8 years in devops, and I'm perfectly fine with my job. Good work life balance, and nothing happens when I'm oncall. Just to bring some perspective :) "Happy customer never yells" and all

#### Reply 2 by u/FISHMANPET1 (28 points)

Nothing here is incompatible with good work-life balance. I love my job, I love that everyday is a new challenge and a new puzzle I get to piece together. I love to dig into something and figure out how it works. And then at the end of the day I go home and do something else. (He says, posting on Reddit before getting dressed for the day).

DevOps has a lot of ambiguity, and a wide array of tasks. Are you able to quickly dig into something and become mediocre at it? Or do you feel unsure of your ability to quickly learn new things? If you're not confident in your ability to learn new things, DevOps won't be for you.

Nothing else matters. You can't compare career progression and salary bands between two jobs if you're only good at one of them. Pick the career you're better at, that's where you'll have more success.

#### Reply 3 by u/iminalotoftrouble (7 points)

This is spot on. Expanding on OPs point since other commenters are making an incorrect assumption, having an 'intrinsic love of getting to know how something works' != Working extra hours, being obsessive about your role, sacrificing yourself for the bottom line, unhealthy work-life balance, etc. 

In fact, it often results in the opposite. Those are symptoms of yet another complex system that you might want to understand and improve. If that excites you more you should consider management. 

I'm in an IC role that allows me to delve into both. Simple example, 50% of PagerDuty alerts are ignored and escalated to the third tier of our workflow, a manager rotation. 

A less curious person would say "this is a leadership problem, teams need to take ownership of their services" 

A more curious person might ask "why aren't people responding? Is PagerDuty not implemented effectively? Are we burning out when on-call through alert fatigue? Are alerts so rare that team members simply forget about their rotations? Are we pre-configuring too many alerts through our reference pattern? Do devs not have the context needed to take action on their alerts?" 

The former is 100% right, this is an ownership problem and it's part of the job. The latter wants to find the root cause(s) of the problem, not exclusively address the symptom.

This is such an unhealthy outlook. It’s a job people. Stop making it your life.

#### Reply 5 by u/Competitive_Tip9139 (3 points)

Very well said, basically only thing that kept me interested in my anti devops-devops position at current company. Being a tinkerer and fascinated by what happens behind scenes. Without that fu jenkins im out

#### Reply 6 by u/andarmanik (3 points)

There is a non zero percent of devops where you get to build internal heroku. If you get to do that type of stuff it can be as chill as development. It’s stressful when you are working on tickets / on call but I imagine it has its own reward.

### Comment 2 by u/pkayboi (96 points)

I had chose devops because i love to discover stuff.... research, love to talk a lot and i am big fan of detective stuff....  
Here checking issues with logs and automating stuff... Feeling proud when hundreds of people use CICD i wrote and they feel happy when in minutes their changes get reflected on PROD! ahaaaa best feeling ever!

#### Reply 1 by u/imadade (8 points)

definately!!

i always wonder how devops is like at bigtech tho (amzn,meta,google,mfst, etc) compared with banks/insurance/other f500 companies.

Are they more systems? hybrid?

### Comment 3 by u/ArieHein (34 points)

None.
Be a farmer. Grow food.
People are always hungry.

Half seriously though both are good as long as you are very agile in your thinking and adopting new tech fast.
Both fields are going through a huge transformation with AI is the next evolution in the human evolution. This requires both skill and mental juggling.

If what youre after is stability till you retire, not sure either is good compared to say network engineer as at the end of the day, all data needs to pass on wires, doesn't matter what data is.

how many years of exp you have?

#### Reply 2 by u/not_logan (-7 points)

Food production is highly automated already. I saw Chinese bots gathering apples and peaches from trees (you can imagine how complex this task is), and Russians created a fully-autmonus grain harvester that doesn't require any human interaction at all. I think food production will be conducted completely automated this generation, 20-30 years max

Probably software developer will always have a higher earning potential - because after all software developer is the person who actually produces product whereas DevOps is a supporting (infrastructure) role

That being said, software devs are also much more often outsourced as opposed to devops and have to live with annoying scrum meetings that devops guys are often exempt from

#### Reply 1 by u/PangolinZestyclose30 (6 points)

> Probably software developer will always have a higher earning potential - because after all software developer is the person who actually produces product whereas DevOps is a supporting (infrastructure) role

Sad, but true. DevOps = cost center, SWE = value creation. (true only in software / product companies. If you're building internal software projects, you're a cost center as SWE as well). Companies are generally trying to lower the costs and invest into the value creating parts of the company.

#### Reply 2 by u/beeeffgee (5 points)

What would software devs deploy to without infrastructure? I routinely see DevOps salaries far exceeding that of developers at the same points in their careers.

#### Reply 3 by u/AlterTableUsernames (0 points)

What we call "DevOps" is just a niche IT Developer. SWEs will always have the edge, because they can do anything what IT does or pick it up swiftly, if neccessary.

#### Reply 4 by u/ryancarton (1 points)

At my company they outsourced both roles, but they lost a lot of money with the Indian development team, but kept the one Indian DevOps guy.

### Comment 5 by u/cocoaLemonade22 (12 points)

Neither. Whichever one is impacted will begin pivoting to the other.

### Comment 6 by u/dariusbiggs (23 points)

Software Engineering is the easier of the two jobs, less stress, less panic.

DevSecOps you still do software development, but you also need to learn ops, keep up with tooling advances, deal with outages, panic, databases, and so much more.

I love DevSecOps for its insanity, but occasionally just want a few quiet days to just work on some code to relax.

They're both going to be around for many many more decades.

DevSecOps is considered a step up from Software Engineer and is the better path towards Software Architect or Solution Architect.

### Comment 7 by u/Zestyclose-Ad7944 (6 points)

I personally think it's more future-proof to know both, knowing DevOps stuff will make you a better software engineer and vice-versa. From my last few years of work experience, there is a trend to let software developers owning both the code + infrastructure as well as incident support. It makes sense, as it gives developers incentive to implement better error handing or even self-healing features so they can avoid too much support work. In return, it often comes with better compensation.

### Comment 8 by u/testo100 (6 points)

Either if you’re good enough. If not then both are at risk. Devops tools can technically be automated that devops engineer will be just a button clicker on AWS that reads the doc. However same can go for a SWE. Skilled people will be still in demand but for different reasons.

#### Reply 1 by u/rabbit_in_a_bun (2 points)

case in point, in MS, software devs create their own pipelines. At least the ones I know.

### Comment 9 by u/BigNavy (3 points)

No one can decide for you what’s best for you. And no one can tell you the future holds; maybe this meteor comes and knocks us back into the stone ages and the ability to fish is a way safer bet than computer anything.

However, having said all that - not to state the obvious, but complexity is hard. There are complex things about writing software, and there are complex things about CICD/Infra/Platform Engineering/whatever our latest buzzwords are. AI is not ready to handle even mild complexity, and likely never will be. Do what you enjoy - because all that other stuff (pay bands and career growth) - all that could flip tomorrow. Doing something you don't hate and are good at (usually!) last way longer, and doesn't depend on anything besides you.

### Comment 10 by u/Jonteponte71 (3 points)

I got tired of the daily grind being mostly the same working as both as a developer and as a QA Test Automation Engineer. Specifically within the confines of the agile process. When I had the chance to join the DevOps team where I worked at the time, I jumped at it even though I had very little Linux and Sysadmin experience. Turns out the wealth of different things you get to do (and learn) is just so much more varied in the DevOps field then as a SWE. No one day is exactly the same as the next. In the wrong place it can be stressful, but in the right place it’s a joy🤷‍♂️

### Comment 11 by u/TobyDrundridge (3 points)

Learn to write software. 

Become a Software Engineer.

It is easy to work the DevOps way from there.

### Comment 12 by u/not_logan (2 points)

There is no such thing as a future-proof industry. You can try to be a doctor or lawyer because they hold personal accountability for their action so they would not be replaced right away

### Comment 13 by u/thomsterm (2 points)

dude, you're a prefect candidate for a devops engineer imho, it's not like you're transitioning to something totally different, and the difference between and devops engineer and an software engineers shrinks by every year

### Comment 14 by u/devfuckedup (2 points)

I have done both over the course of 15 years. more time in DevOps than in software development. I have found that the skill sets complement each other but I have prefferd being a DevOps engineer. If your just an average engineer, and I know I am, getting interesting work as a software engineer can be challenging whereas DevOps is very similar company to company. In terms of pay software engineers can make more. In terms of employment, I have found it much easier to become employed as a DevOps engineer than as a software engineer.  everyone is going to be differnt I didnt graduate from college. and I started as a systems administrator many years ago. Some one who has a CS degree might find getting thoes SE Jobs easier than I have.

  
On the SE side one thing I didn't enjoy was the fact that my work was soo different company to company sure basic programming skills do compound with time but with DevOps I have found it nice to run into the same tools at most companies. 

Working as a software engineer right now but there is some devops crossover as I am co-founder of a startup right now.  I think both are worth learning and investing in. DevOps personally seems like a long term dead end that keeps you trapped as an employee where as software engineering is something you can go do on your own .

### Comment 15 by u/prodev321 (2 points)

Looks like a plumber fixing pipelines will have more job security than a devops engineer fixing pipelines 😂😂😂😂😂

### Comment 16 by u/hasibrock (1 points)

None to be honest

### Comment 17 by u/Evgenii42 (1 points)

At the risk of sounding cliche and slightly patronizing, I’d say the main question one should ask is not what’s future-proof, pays more, or is better for a career. Rather, it’s better to ask yourself: what do you love doing? And then do more of that. You’ll spend a third of your life at work for decades, so if you choose a profession you hate, no amount of money will matter.

#### Reply 1 by u/denniszen (1 points)

I used to think this way. When I was a journalist, I initially hated doing advertising copy but enjoyed it eventually. Then when I did SEO, I also liked it. Then l learned web development and found it enjoyable as well. I think it depends on mindset. If one generally likes learning, they will always find something they like about it. I am even thinking of become a healthcare professional. But I do draw the line somewhere. I don’t know if I want to be a plumber.

### Comment 18 by u/SNB21 (1 points)

Only adaptability is future-proof. Always keep an ear on the ground so to speak. That's true not just for tech, but for life in general.

### Comment 19 by u/Suitable_End_8706 (1 points)

Im not a devops engineer in particular, but as a platform engineer, I need to maintain our onprem and aws cloud. By maintaining means deploy, patch, provision both resources, attend to multiple tickets from internal users, dev team. Build automation platform, manage and lead infrastructure replacement projects, have to manage dev team, managements, vendors.
Just wth im doing here.

### Comment 20 by u/blackertai (1 points)

Future-proof? [Insert 5+ minutes of rueful laughter here]

### Comment 21 by u/izalac (1 points)

As a role, SWE is certainly more future-proof. But you should absolutely learn DevOps principles.

There's a lot of people with DevOps Engineer title that have vastly different roles across the different companies - or even teams within a same company. There's also a lot of people doing DevOps but with different titles (SWE, SRE, Cloud Engineer, Infra Engineer, Platform Engineer etc). And there are people with these titles that do not. It depends on the team.

Titles might change, and the major question is - what sort of work would you like to do?

### Comment 22 by u/automagication777 (1 points)

Do you enjoy coding stay developer

Do you enjoy working in Linux command line and docker and kubernetes the be a devops engineer.

### Comment 23 by u/omn1p073n7 (1 points)

Welder, Plumber, Electrician, HVAC

### Comment 24 by u/Old-Ad-3268 (1 points)

Continuous learning is future proof.

Also move up the abstraction layers, get paid for what you think and not what you do, there will always be others who can do what you do, for less.

### Comment 25 by u/anno2376 (1 points)

Engineer is the best

### Comment 26 by u/alwaysdefied (1 points)

DevOps

There’s no such thing as future-proof. There is and will be disruption everywhere.

### Comment 28 by u/salocincash (1 points)

Whatever can’t be sent to India or done with the level of cursor and AI.

TLDR; both are not going to seem the booms we saw in the past.

### Comment 29 by u/Legal-Butterscotch-2 (1 points)

None of them.

Buuuttt if I can give you a advice (I'm a devops in manager role now), go for software devoloper with expertise in prompting to IA code generators and expert in refining it. (probably that will disappear in some years too, be prepared or not)

Devops is a fkng consuming mental heath role (I really love devops, no joke), but that's a dead end, since more and more things are tied together to build some kind of "click platform" and we have a lot of SaaS about it

### Comment 30 by u/DistributionStrict19 (1 points)

No career path is now future proo

### Comment 31 by u/Traditional_Sail_641 (1 points)

DevOps easily. But I think you should also consider pentester to the mix. I think Pentesting is a very strong future proof job because the supply of professionals is low.

### Comment 32 by u/trinaryouroboros (1 points)

Future proof. I would think if either was in jeopardy you would have universal basic income or violence.

### Comment 33 by u/gowithflow192 (1 points)

Why? I don’t understand why devs want to go to DevOps. They mostly go back anyway.

### Comment 34 by u/clickittech (1 points)

Here is a blog that talks about the differences of both roles: [https://www.clickittech.com/devops/devops-engineer-vs-software-engineer/](https://www.clickittech.com/devops/devops-engineer-vs-software-engineer/)

### Comment 35 by u/MisterCheesy (1 points)

Learn both? Having skills in both is arguably more future proof.  After all, the first half of Devops is “Dev”.  

That said, I always considered Devops a philosophy more than a dedicated career path.

### Comment 36 by u/random2048assign (0 points)

People work in devops because they fear leetcode. Gitgud!

### Comment 37 by u/gowithflow192 (-6 points)

Neither but remember that even now in these tough times, the DevOps Engineer tasks (automation of app deployment, site reliability) are just being pushed onto existing devs who already have their primary duties of developing software. 

So in this respect, DevOps Engineer roles are already dead except for true SRE and Platform Engineer roles. 

Both jobs are screwed long term by AI. We might even see a hold out of some DevOps Engineer roles because all the disparate systems offer some minor barrier to AI entry.

### Comment 39 by u/Abali1994 (-11 points)

This is a great question, and honestly, both DevOps and Software Engineering have bright futures. However, your choice should depend on your interests and career goals.

Here’s how the two roles differ:

 **Software Engineers**: Primarily focus on coding, building applications, and solving software-related problems. If you enjoy designing features and writing code, this might be the best path for you.**DevOps Engineers**: Work more on automation, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure, and deployment. The goal is to streamline software development and delivery through automation.

Which One Has Better Growth?

* Software engineers have a wide range of opportunities, from web and mobile development to AI and cybersecurity.
* DevOps engineers are in high demand, especially as companies move towards cloud computing and automation. Many businesses are willing to pay more for experienced DevOps professionals.

If you’re considering making the switch, I’d highly recommend reading [this blog](https://apiconnects.co.nz/devops-engineers-vs-software-engineers/).
