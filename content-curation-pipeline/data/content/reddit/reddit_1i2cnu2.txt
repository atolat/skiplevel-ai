# Is there any national (US) software engineering organization to join to try to promote job security across the field?

Question in title. Basically I know we don’t typically have unions, but I’d love to join some organization to promote job security across the field. I was a victim of layoffs at my first job and really had to struggle to get back on my feet, and it honestly doesn’t seem like the climate is getting any more secure due to:

- C-suite thinking they can replace devs with AI
- C-suite thinking they can replace devs with offshore teams
- C-suite thinking they can blindly layoff half of the devs with no repercussions
- Younger devs and new grads having significantly less opportunity (not my problem anymore but it’s still messed up imo)

Anybody know any organizations fighting for this?

You'd basically need a union to meaningfully achieve this aim. 

Next best thing is create mentoring and networking organizations that help steer people towards good companies and help enforce good engineering cultures and practices. But this will only have so much effect. Bad engineering practices aren't punished that much in the current market. Even Cloudstrike's stock was back up 4 months after their massive fuckup.

As a bay area Engineer, I’m pessimistic about the likelihood of forming a union given how widespread libertarian ideology is among developers I’ve met.

So if a union is going to happen somewhere, it ain’t here.

Do  doctors have a union ? They have a licensing body AMA

#### Reply 3 by u/497Penguins (7 points)

Yeah at this point a union would be nice, but the engineers in this field are famously not united enough to make one - which makes me want to know if there’s something else somewhat in its place

If such union existed, why would the union let you or someone join?

Currently, you can just job hop and get offers from any companies.

If such union existed, the union can shut you out of joining the union, for whatever reason, and you can't get tech jobs at companies with the union.  Then what, you're shut out of tech career, no matter your skills.  This has happened in union shops and will happen in union shops.

Hmmm, maybe IEEE? We take all of our standards from them

Their code of ethics is quite solid. I read it when in undergrad (president of my univ. ACM for a few years) and I think it would help a lot of (particularly junior, but all) devs/etc. know how to handle sticky situations better.

Something that a guild could help in our field is to ensure that people know WTF they're doing. You don't get into the guild until you've proven that you're qualified. Not a new idea for these organizations, even though some political nonsense says that the concept is wireless. Would be a selling point for execs too if done properly.

#### Reply 1 by u/TheFaithfulStone (1 points)

The guild is a good idea, but I doubt you could design a qualification exam that more than a bare majority of currently working programmers could pass.  What is the overlap of knowledge between someone who does embedded device programming for airplanes and the person who controls what shade of blue buttons are on Facebook?  There are more programmers from self taught hackers to comp-sci PhD holders who are worried they’d be in the 49% of people who suddenly have a target on their back than people willing to join a guild.

I wish there was a Union for this industry. I’d even take 10% less pay if that’s what it took. 

Job security seems to be the biggest issue with being a developer. I’ve been laid off once during Covid, and my current role and company is pretty stable, but it doesn’t make me feel secure. Come to think of it, I’ve never felt secure as a developer. And on top of this, the interview process for someone who is experienced is so convoluted and different depending on the company, it sucks big time. You can be a rockstar at your last role but if you don’t pass some trivial technical assessment not even related to the job, you’re shit outta luck. Before I worked as a developer, I worked in the automotive industry and never felt like I’d be swept out at any moments notice. The downside was the pay. But I guess that’s the trade off - we make more money but are very susceptible to being laid off.

#### Reply 1 by u/RaccoonDoor (17 points)

If it was possible to buy job security, it would probably cost a lot more than 10% of your pay.

#### Reply 2 by u/Quick_Turnover (5 points)

The work is too varied imo. The trades have unions because the output is much more obvious. Install this HVAC unit. Put a roof on this 2000 sqft house. Lay these bricks in this direction.

Software quality, different languages, types of systems, specific niches... it's just too broad of a category with too much variance in skillset. You need some amount of homogeneity in order to negotiate like-for-like terms. 

I think it'd make more sense to have a standards body with certs or something. If we're all gonna do leetcode and system design just let me get my cert re-upped every year and skip that bullshit in interviews.

#### Reply 3 by u/rexspook (4 points)

Unions usually mean better pay. The anti-union campaigns by corporations have really done a great job of perpetuating the myth that unions cost employees.

Git Gud is the only job security in tech industry. Always has been, always will be.

You want to influence execs to learn from the past. 


Learning from the past goes against human nature

#### Reply 1 by u/497Penguins (0 points)

They won’t learn, but maybe we can organize and lobby a little bit to force their hands.

#### Reply 2 by u/IUpvoteGME (1 points)

The only thing to learn from history is that not one person has learned a goddamned thing from history.

No that I know but willing to join the cause. Let’s tax the shit out of those that abuse offshoring in favor of profits and don’t support American talent

I joined ACM to enjoy the company of my peers and revel in the promotion of computing science as a true science, until Vint Cerf as president of the organisation opened up his arrogant fat mouth and proclaimed that computer science is dead.


I felt betrayed by this prick and I am glad I didn't vote for the cunt. 


During his tenure I saw nothing but him degrading software engineering and the people who have set up their careers promoting ACM ethics and standards.


Some organisations are detrimental to the industry and ACM have let themselves down with this episode.

I don't believe you will find a tech company that has this but non-tech companies might have what you are looking for entrenched in their culture.


They are also incredibly painfully slow on the tech adoption curve. By the time they catch up, you will be eligible for pension.

### Comment 13 by u/reddit_man_6969 (2 points)

Everyone wants a guarantee that they’ll have what they need for life, but that is just not realistic. Capital is at risk for every company, and labor is less risky but there is still plenty of risk involved.

There was a bubble for SE labor so we exploited it. Now it’s popping and we gotta figure out what’s next. What do people really need done for them to the point that they’ll pay well? Anything else is just delaying the inevitable.

When you consider options, try to think through how secure the position really is. It’s hard, and you can do the right thing and still get screwed, but ultimately that’s what we can do

### Comment 14 by u/[deleted] (6 points)

If you believe...



1. C-suite optimizes for profits
2. Replacing devs with AI and off shore is bad for business


This problem sorts itself out pretty quickly. 


If we're wrong and we are replaceable by AI/off shoring, no amount of organizing in going to stop it.

#### Reply 1 by u/hachface (8 points)

They don't optimize for profits. They optimize for short-term perception management to increase the company's notional valuation on speculative markets, because that's what their compensation structure incentivizes them to do.

### Comment 16 by u/Guilty_Serve (5 points)

No. People are not going to like what I have to say here: our jobs have always been about keeping up and continuous learning. There's no real way to unionize around that because a union that amount of safety might discourage the continuous growth needed. The white collar is supposed to be stress; which is why we get paid so well. It's stressful for successful lawyers, doctors, bankers, and it supposed to be that for us. 

What job security do you have in this? Well I'm not sure where massive bureaucratic corporations get the fucking nerve to tell me my job will be replaced by a bunch of formulaic administrators. There's paradigm shifts in tech with bubbles and bursts. That's the always been the nature of it. Warren Buffet once stated that he doesn't invest in tech because there's no moat to stop a few engineers going after big slow fucking companies. Zuck *really* believes he can not bleed his market share to a few devs that figure out how to not have a timeline polluted with shit. Few of us hold the power to fuck with multi-million/billion dollar companies. That's your security.

Hollywood has always been thoroughly unionized but that has never stopped the technical people who work on films from innovating. Feature films are also ephemeral projects that lay off literally everyone as soon as the film is done, yet the Hollywood unions survive. In fact the regularity and predictability that union deals bring to filmmaking has been instrumental in the business even existing.

People I think have extremely narrow-minded ideas about what unions can be. Their forms are determined by what their membership wants.

### Comment 17 by u/hammertime84 (3 points)

Some software engineers are unionized. Code-CWA is the typical one used: https://code-cwa.org/

Nothing else really impacts this so as difficult as it is to get software people to grasp what unions are, it's the only way.

I’ve seen software engineers at aerospace companies be in unions.

### Comment 19 by u/CanIhazCooKIenOw (2 points)

Given a big part of software engineering is manufacturing said code it's only expected that the same will happen that already did for any other manufacturing labour.

C'est la vie

You can join the Git Gud union.  Learn, practice and get extensive experiences solving tech problems and making millions of $$$ for companies and Git Gud.  Then simply demonstrate Git Gud skills and experiences in tech interviews and get direct company offers.  No need for middle man stuff.

Yeah no shit. But that’s not gonna protect you when they move your whole team’s responsibilities to India for a third of the price.

Why someone should fight for that? Isn’t it just regular evolution? Like Horses —> Cars and industrialization?

#### Reply 1 by u/497Penguins (1 points)

1. AI isn’t enough to replace devs like the atm did to bank tellers. It’s a good (sometimes) tool, nothing more.
2. Offshoring isn’t innovation, it’s exploitation by the upper class. Countries need trade borders to a certain extent or segments of their economies will get blown away. If this plays out it will enrich the upper class, decimate the software engineering field in the US, and lead to greater enshittification of our tech, as offshored dev teams typically don’t bring quality
