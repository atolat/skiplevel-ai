# Developer for 12 yrs. Need career advice to move to a leadership role.

Hi everyone. I need some advice on my next career move. I am a developer in the MS office 365, compliance, azure and power platform space. I am presently working in a non service based MNC earling around 45 lpa.

I am looking to upskill for my next career move. I would like to be connected with technology in some ways but want to move into more of a a leadership role.( Which impacts the org through technology solutions). What should I do? Should I go for pmp certifications? Should I complete tech certifications ( I have none. Surprised?).

I am not getting any opportunities where I can transition to a leadership role . Hence asking.
