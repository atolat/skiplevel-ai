# Promoted to senior but salary kept at intermediate engineer pay band. Should I ask to work reduced hours?

I work at a midsized company and I've been here for over 4 years. The company has gotten really bad ever since private equity took over. Almost everyone is a "key person" because basically everyone else left or was laid off. This includes myself, as I am responsible for a critical part of the software, which includes everything from design to documentation, to testing, to taking client calls, etc.

I was promoted to a senior earlier this year but I found out that I am earning instead on the high end of what an intermediate engineer is getting paid. I set up a meeting with the site director (I have no manager - he was fired) and the director told me that "the budget doesn't allow for salary increases right now."

So if I am not getting paid a full time senior salary, I don't exactly see why I should devote full time hours to this employer. Am I justified?

**Edit 1**: I missed a detail that I see coming up a bit. The company is desperate to keep people. Most of the key people have already left and we're crumbling under technical debt. We've already had one engineer who was offered 4 days a week just so that he could stay a bit longer and share his knowledge.

**Edit 2**: For anyone who's wondering, I work in the distributed systems space. I have 10+ years of experience with python and 6+ years of experience with C++. I also hold a master's degree. Given how many python jobs there are, I see no issue finding another job.

**Edit 3**: Wow I didn't expect this question to take off... I wish I could reply to everyone but there's just too many opinions! Seems like I'm not the only one who's had these sorts of experiences!

I'd be out of there.

#### Reply 1 by u/9ubj (112 points)

Me too. Basically the only reason I still want to stay is because it's fully remote and I am honestly concerned about whether I could find another remote job. I only worked at an office full time for 6 months and hated every minute of it

PE ruined my favorite job with my favorite team that I still keep in touch with today. Company has gone to shit and I think has been dissolved or absorbed.

### Comment 4 by u/rust_devx (76 points)

Don't ask, just do it (assuming this is a full time role and/or they're not monitoring your hours). Or put less effort/energy. And then use that energy to look for a new job on the side.

#### Reply 1 by u/9ubj (23 points)

This is the right answer :)

### Comment 5 by u/SufficientlyEpic (118 points)

Just to be clear, pay bands very often overlap. It's very likely that when you're earning on the high end of intermediate that you're at the low end of senior. Pay bands are intended to measure experience in the role, sounds like you're newly promoted so you're in roughly the right spot from an HR standpoint.
But still, maybe you're more valuable to the business and can make a case for more money or maybe the market is paying more and you should get out.

#### Reply 1 by u/9ubj (30 points)

Hmm okay - yes that does make sense. Right now I am the only person that can troubleshoot their systems, because I was the one who built them + inherited some legacy code. They did promise me another salary adjustment soon, but honestly I have a hard time with "promises"

### Comment 6 by u/thehumblestbean (66 points)

Why would a company in the midst of being gutted by a PE firm give a shit about your request to work less hours? Read the writing on the wall and get out of there instead of making a request when you know the business's answer will be no.

#### Reply 1 by u/9ubj (20 points)

They offered another engineer 4 days a week just to stay. They are desperate. That's why

### Comment 7 by u/Material_Zombie7466 (15 points)

Roles usually have pretty wide pay bands, and they usually overlap. So if you’re at the high end of the intermediate band, you’re probably at the low end of the senior band, which is normal. It’s unlikely they would put you at the high end of the senior band when you’re just promoted into that role.

#### Reply 1 by u/9ubj (4 points)

That part makes sense, yep. I'm trying to view this situation in a more optimistic light and you make a good point

### Comment 8 by u/lunchpadmcfat (20 points)

#### Reply 1 by u/9ubj (7 points)

Yep - learned that the hard way. This is my first job post college and the first two years were okay and then when PE came in, literally overnight morale was dead. We've been bleeding talent ever since. I recall that in the first week we lost like 25% of our staff

#### Reply 2 by u/Jomiru (3 points)

What does PE mean?

#### Reply 3 by u/montastera (2 points)

Yea, my company was acquired by a company that's currently owned by a PE firm, and the changes that were mandated by the PE firm have mostly sucked.  One interesting development after the acquisition was that the leadership from the company that acquired us was slowly replaced by leadership from my company.  I was very close to quitting after the acquisition, but I have a lot of respect for the leadership at my company, and when some key leadership positions were taken over by leadership from my company, it convinced me to stay to see how things unfold.  Overall I'm glad I stayed, but there have been some out of pattern decisions made by leadership which were not well received by anyone (including myself), and I'm pretty convinced the decisions were at least partially orchestrated by the PE firm.

Idk what to think anymore, I'm still bought into the companies mission, and generally enjoy the people I work with, but there's no exit event in sight, and with the macro-economic climate, things are feeling pretty dismal.  Sometimes I consider leaving (partially motivated by me needing to fix my mental health), but I feel like I'm in a golden handcuffs situation since I have a bunch of vested stock options, and I feel like I would have to forego exercising them if I leave early and instead use my savings to bridge the unemployment gap.

### Comment 9 by u/Big-Veterinarian-823 (8 points)

A promotion without a raise like saying: 

"we pretend to appreciate you and hope that you are stupid enough to believe us".

Should you work for a company that says/does this to you?

### Comment 10 by u/Kobelvl_Throwaway (18 points)

You're kind of shit out of luck in this situation. However, you can try to see if weaponized mediocrity can be something you can try. Do as little as you can, stay a little above the line where anyone would consider firing or even putting you on PIP. Depending on your company's management,  you can ride this out for like an entire year as you search for a new job.

#### Reply 1 by u/9ubj (10 points)

I do have a side hustle and my mortgage payment is quite low ($500). I'm not worried about finances but I'm basically worried about losing remote work. That's basically the only thing keeping me at this point

### Comment 11 by u/[deleted] (6 points)

People tend to take advantage of engineers. I have learned it the hard way. Promoting one with just a title is an old trick in the book. Even glorifying your job in front of others is another tactic in the book. Getting tags is only helpful if a hike increase backs it. 

In your situation, I would do the following, talk to your manager and share the concerns, give him or her the benefit of the doubt. There are a few things they will come back with; one will be they will increase the salary in the next cycle or adjust the payment as a bonus. Red FLAG. They will not. 

If he/she starts the process immediately, you might want to stay. 

If they cannot, and you see nothing going anywhere, take the title and the increased responsibility. Search immediately for a new job. With a raised title and more responsibility to add, you might be able to attract a much better second job. But leave the first job only after they change the title.

Fwiw, I got promod to senior and my salary stayed the same for a couple months until annual adjustments went into effect. If I listened to this sub, I would have quit. I stayed cuz I liked the people and the company. My manager explained it was a huge oversight that they didn’t have the budget immediately and apologized many times.

That company got acquired and I cashed out over seven figures. Glad I didn’t listen to this sub. And you shouldn’t necessarily either. Nobody here understands your work dynamic so use your best judgment.

### Comment 14 by u/KickAssWilson (6 points)

Leave.  The PE firm is in the midst of cutting your company.   If you stay, you’ll end up being laid off.  

Use this time to find another position.  If you want remote, try looking for that while you still have a job.  At least you’ll know if a position like that exists.  If it doesn’t, you can make a decision from there.

Not sure you’ll take that advice though.  From your responses to others, you seem hell bent on staying.   Looking around now won’t hurt.  Good luck.

This is called a wealth extraction. They are going to pick the meat off the bones of your company and leave it a useless shell, and move on. They are not interested in running the business long term. 

>I was promoted to a senior earlier this year but I found out that I am earning instead on the high end of what an intermediate engineer is getting paid. I set up a meeting with the site director (I have no manager - he was fired) and the director told me that "the budget doesn't allow for salary increases right now."

But to do that they need suckers to stay and keep the company operational in the short term. 

Plan your exit strategy and do as little work as you can get away with.

### Comment 20 by u/FormerKarmaKing (3 points)

First, never ever worry about the pay bands at your company. When you do that you're negotiating with the parameters set by the other side. Also, it's way too easy become or  appear petty relative to co-workers.

The magic phrase is "that's not competitive with the general market." If they push, just tell them you get recruited regularly and leave it at that.

But like others said, just gtfo. Tech debt + PE => nothing good is going to happen here.

### Comment 21 by u/Ok_Opportunity2693 (3 points)

If the budget doesn’t allow for a pay increase to senior, then you haven’t actually been promoted to senior. Just keep giving them junior work product and spend the rest of your time applying to new jobs (with senior on your resume, of course).

### Comment 22 by u/[deleted] (3 points)

You already accepted the new position at the new salary. Go get an offer or offers from somewhere else and don't be worried about staying transparent with your manager. If they counter with something you're happy with, stay there, otherwise jump ship. 

Sounds like upper management is either intentionally sabotaging this business unit or is slashing costs to the point that they're going to milk everyone talented dry until a hack crew can keep the ship floating for under market value. Either way, not a great sign for long term prospects here. (There is a world where you can show them you can play ball and also be a profits monster and get to a director position if that's what you'd like. Probably won't feel good though.)

### Comment 23 by u/Wassa76 (3 points)

Yeah I agree with some others. 

Pay bands overlap so the high end of a lower tier can earn more than the low end of a higher tier. 

It often kicks off when people on the higher tier find that they’re paid the same/less than people below them. 

What it might mean is that your salary ceiling is lifted and you might start getting bigger annual raises, the company I was last at worked that way. 

It however mean they just don’t have the funds to pay you more and they’re hoping the title keeps you there. Did you get any more responsibilities or just the same old role?

#### Reply 1 by u/bwainfweeze (1 points)

More responsibilities for the same pay is worse.

Responsibility and authority are different possessions. Don’t confuse the two. We’re at loggerheads with an ops team at the moment because they’ve built themselves a nail bed they have to lay on and they have had a deathbed conversion to delegation, only now the rest of us are responsible for configuring some system, but they’re afraid (with in some cases very good reasons) that people will fuck it up so they’re mandatory PR reviewers and fond of blocking PRs.

So they have the authority to accept work, but we have the responsibility for it being right (and also it’s now a very slow asynchronous process)? Fuck that. That’s not delegation, that’s ibeing voluntold. Conscription, if you will.

### Comment 24 by u/farox (2 points)

> "the budget doesn't allow for salary increases right now."

https://youtu.be/s7M5wpitHo4?t=8

It's an idiotic management that just lets a key person like that just go. I'd lean into that, if you want to stay at the company, and play a bit harder for more salary.

### Comment 25 by u/Alpheus2 (2 points)

Sounds like you’ll only start looking for a new job after you get fired. That’s a nono.

You should be interviewing actively while you’re still employed.

### Comment 26 by u/nothingbutt (2 points)

So based on your replies, I think the winning strategy is to just work the job as it is while you find another remote job. You mentioned you're worried about finding another remote position. Well, now is the time to try to find one. They are definitely still out there just maybe a little more competitive than before. But you should be able to use your senior title to get better compensation too. If you aren't experienced at salary negotiation, now is the time to learn too. First thing is don't reveal what you make right now. This is a good read on the subject:

### Comment 27 by u/28carslater (2 points)

Private equity is usually pretty horrible as an owner. I'd start looking but know the industry at large is saturated right now. I had 145 applicants *in two days* to a crappy but remote QA II role, nearly all of the 10 people we interviewed were overqualified with 10-20+ years experience.

This isn't the very best time to look for work but your experience, both distributed and languages, and YOE make you highly employable.

Too bad the private equity people are ruining the company but that's not your problem.

The fact that your director would not do one thing to sweeten the deal, even if they can't offer money, shows what they really think of you.

### Comment 31 by u/Kaizen321 (2 points)

Get yo money or bounce!

Work on that resume as a Senior dev, see if you get some nice hits and that sweet pay bump.

### Comment 32 by u/epical2019 (2 points)

I would just look for another job. I did that at my first dev job. I was there for 4 years as a developer. I went up from junior to intermediate and just wanted intermediate pay but they just wouldn't pay me that. I told them I intend to look for another job and the manager I was working with said she didn't blame me and that the top manager was being unreasonable. Literally the next day I was contacted on LinkedIn and got the pay I wanted plus extra for travel and they paid my medical aid. It was such a good feeling and they were happy to be paying me that salary. Sometimes it's better to just start looking for another job. Also your skills won't stagnate and you will probably get a decent raise.

### Comment 33 by u/lottspot (2 points)

If your title has been elevated to senior, you will not struggle to find a place which will pay you like a senior.

### Comment 34 by u/sanityjanity (2 points)

It sounds like you should be looking for a different job.  If you get an offer elsewhere, you can potentially use it as leverage.  I'm sure their budget doesn't allow for salary increases, but they're going to have to pay more if you leave, soooo....

### Comment 35 by u/curt94 (2 points)

The only thing PE is good at is squeezing.  Everything will get worse.  Once they take over, it's time to leave. Don't stick around so they can milk more productivity out of you for less money and worse benefits.

### Comment 36 by u/mightyDrunken (2 points)

Whoever bought your company are doing it wrong.

The company I work for was bought up by a private equity fund a few years ago. Their strategy was to modernise the company by putting more money in IT especially in regard to getting more online, global sales.

They also bought up a number of small competitors in other countries to give more global reach. The investment has paid off and the company is currently doing very well, more than the sum of its extra parts.

Now the company is up for sale, no doubt to try to get a tidy profit. Hopefully we are bought up by someone who wants to invest and not strip mine the company.

### Comment 37 by u/deefstes (2 points)

Do you really want to work reduced hours? I don't think you do. You're just looking for a way to mitigate for this disparity between your role and your salary 

But, as a software engineer, you probably already know that the work isn't going to decrease and by working fewer hours, you'll just find yourself under more pressure to get more done during the hours that you do work. The pressure might come from the company, it might come from yourself. Probably both.

Working fewer hours is not the answer.

That's exactly it =P

### Comment 38 by u/VanayananTheReal (2 points)

You should not work reduced hours. You should do the job to your best ability or leave for greener pastures, with no in between. 

That being said: PE take over, key people that can't get raises...unless you have \*a lot\* of golden-handcuff perks tied to this sinking ship, I'd be out ASAP.  (And I'd \*heavily\* discount what your existing golden-handcuffs are nominally worth.)

### Comment 39 by u/TokenGrowNutes (2 points)

They need you, so you still have some skin in this game. In your situation I would punch out by 3pm every day, appointments rest of day, darn!, offline 100% through weekends. Minimal effort here. You will get the most bang for your effort shrinking the window a little bit.

### Comment 43 by u/Sinthrill (1 points)

Most companies for unintuitive reasons wont negotiate around you working 30 instead of 40 hours a week. If you can't negotiate it, you can quietly work fewer hours, but you are only really allowed to work fewer hours if people don't notice, which means making your job a low pressure environment. If you can do that, I don't see any reason to spend any number of hours aside from the bare minimum working assuming you fulfill your job duties.   


Ultimately I don't know what is going on your life, but it sounds like from your post you want to promote to a Senior Dev and 'working less' is a bit of a fall back plan for you to cope with this difficult situation. If you can spend 10 hours, I think you should interview at a few other companies to understand what your true BATNA is and possibly find a better situation. Spending time interviewing is important because the alternative is working with a company who is signaling to you through their crappy promotion that they wont invest in you for your next job. You should want to be a position where a company supports your goals.

#### Reply 1 by u/9ubj (0 points)

What do you mean? I was already promoted to a senior dev. Working less is to adjust for the fact that I am technically doing a senior's work while being paid an intermediate dev's salary. However, some people have pointed out that perhaps there's overlap between the "early senior" pay and "late intermediate" pay

### Comment 44 by u/TimmmV (1 points)

One thing to remember is that budgets and pay bands are things that are entirely made up, they aren't real and are basically just another way of saying "we don't want to" only wrapped up in the language of a manager or HR.

You should interview for other places and leave.

### Comment 46 by u/SituationSoap (0 points)

No. Of course not. 

Do you want to leave? Go for it. Go find another job that'll pay you better. Do you want to talk to your site manager or whatever and get yourself re-classified back down to the previous band? Go for that, too.

Fucking off and doing a shitty job because you don't think you're being paid enough is going to do nothing but straight up get you fired. Anyone who tells you otherwise is giving you shitty advice.

Not every job is going to be a good job. In fact, almost none of your jobs are going to be Good Jobs. Doing a shitty job because a job doesn't fit your definition of "good" is a quick trip to never doing a good job on anything you do.

### Comment 47 by u/YPCrumble (0 points)

If you want helpful answers you need to share numbers of what you’re being paid and what “senior” is being paid. 

Being coy about your salary hurts you and helps your employer.

### Comment 48 by u/alwaysleftout (0 points)

Did they give a raise when you were promoted?

### Comment 49 by u/[deleted] (-7 points)

4 years and demanding mid-banding on senior dev is a bit entitled. You may not be happy at your next employer with that attitude tbh as you're always going to want more. High end of mid-tier banding sounds like a good fit for where you're at. It's good you've snagged the title as you can now put that on your CV.

Whatever you do, do not quit without another job lined up - especially if you're in Europe. Our job market is less liquid and it's easy to not see how tough it is from inside of a paying job.

If you're genuinely bothered by this title/compensation, just skill up on pluralsight while working from home.

#### Reply 1 by u/9ubj (6 points)

So I should do more work for the same amount of pay? Employment is a two way transaction. If I am promoted and take on additional responsibilities, I should be paid to take on additional responsibilities... there's nothing entitled about that. Also I am in Canada

### Comment 50 by u/MisterMeta (1 points)

Did you get a raise at all upon promotion? Because it sounds like you "found out" you get paid less upon learning the pay band of the prior role.

Technically you were a higher intermediate not long ago so you were being compensated appropriately. If they also threw a bit of extra on top when they promoted you to senior then they're doing right by you.

Not sure why everyone is so eager to chant quit at a situation that may very well be fine.

#### Reply 1 by u/9ubj (1 points)

I did but it was very low. Think a couple % above COLA. Before I was getting 20% YoY. Really that was fine - and all of this would have made sense given today's economy, etc, but then I spoke to two senior engineers who quit and they were both making around 15% more than me. But... then again... they had more years of total experience. So it's pretty tough to actually gauge whether I am being conned

### Comment 51 by u/horror-pangolin-123 (1 points)

I'd start applying to other companies.

At the same time, ask for a reduction in work time, but do it gently and don't make a situation where you have to quit on the spot if things don't go your way. That way you don't make your current situation untenable and have room to look for a better job without any rush.

Also, since you work remotely, you can quietly reduce your work time. Just stop working an hour or two early every day and appear online for Slack / Teams or whatever IM you're using. Not as good as having an actual day to yourself, but you can do house chores or just relax a bit more.

### Comment 52 by u/azur08 (1 points)

Do the pay bands overlap?

Also, if they’re desperate, negotiate?

### Comment 53 by u/[deleted] (1 points)

Bruh... you already have 16 yoe and even in this market, companies would hire senior or lead engineers.

I've seen few good openings in distributed systems in my country for staff roles, so just move elsewhere.

### Comment 54 by u/otishotpie (1 points)

The high end of an intermediate band is usually the low end of a senior band, that's probably not going to pull any weight in discussions with management about salary. 

Honestly, you could try pushing on this again. If you push on it once, they might think they can brush you off and nickel and dime you. If you push on it more they might take it more seriously and try and appease you. Companies will say that they have salary freezes and what not but if push comes to shove they can be bargained with if you have enough leverage. The key is having a discussion that you can back up with evidence about the unique value you have been able to provide to the company. Don't threaten anything, but in positive terms highlight that a comp increase would be a mutual investment and solidify your dedication to the company. If they aren't amenable to that, you could ask if there are other areas they would be willing to negotiate on such as increased PTO or expected work hours per week.

If that doesn't work, I would consider just "quiet quitting" or whatever you want to call it. Start inflating your estimates a bit, be less proactive in unblocking yourself, and start slowly working less hours. Do enough so that your reduction in work is not easily noticeable and use the extra time to either look for a new job or just have a better work life balance.

### Comment 55 by u/reboog711 (1 points)

### Comment 57 by u/gerd50501 (1 points)

if they can't keep anyone, its unlikely you will be fired. so stick to 40 hours. if they say the work needs to get done, just go no. if everyone is leaving you won't get fired if you produce to a certain extent. 

you dont ask. you just go home. if they have high turnover and can't keep people its unlikely you will be fired.

### Comment 58 by u/[deleted] (1 points)

Ask for a retention bonus and start applying to roles while you have a job

### Comment 59 by u/SeaSafe2923 (1 points)

Weak target detected. Ask for reduced hours + raise, worst you'll get is a "no", then proceed to gently put salt in the wound and ask again, they probably can't hire a replacement anyway.

Either way, the company won't last much, take whatever you can.

### Comment 60 by u/McN697 (1 points)

The hardest jumps are the ones beyond senior.  Parlay your position to manager if you can.  You could try for a Staff title, but it’s hard to back it with a good story when you jump.

Less hours might be an option, but that sets you up for a layoff which will inevitably happen when they find enough offshore people.

Ultimately, start looking to jump.

### Comment 63 by u/randonumero (1 points)

I'd probably ask if there are plans for in-grade raises or whatever your company calls it. If you're told no to that then I'd be asking myself why I even got a promotion. Personally given what you described I'd slowly start preparing to get a new job and applying while doing the minimum. Looks like they might have tried to placate you with a promotion to keep you. Too bad they didn't go with more money or a better quality of life

“Developer” isn’t in charge of critical parts of the software. So not only aren’t they paying you they’ve also been withholding titles which would have made it easier for you to leave. Now that you have the title, you’re thinking about leaving, because you’re no longer trapped. 

That’s abuse. 

> I have 10+ years of experience with python and 6+ years of experience with C++.

And just now getting senior? Or Staff?  One of those invites a ton more questions, but I know which way I’m expecting those questions to go. 

I learned a very powerful phrase just a few years ago:

Not my circus, not my clowns.

On a more positive note, the other way promotions during hard times can go is if they offer you more autonomy instead of money. Some fraction of my salary is hazard pay for having to deal with tech debt and bad architecture I hate and don’t have good feelings about the author over. They can offer it, or you can take it. But know that if you have to take it, it might be seen as quiet quitting, it may take a long time for them to admit you improved productivity for the team for the year by insisting in fixing problems instead of being interrupt driven, it may be that only your peers ever see what you did for them. It may only be a subset of your peers ans subordinates. 

But what’s the worst they can do, fire you? 

The company has proven it can’t sustain its current path. Something has to change, and given what has transpired so far, it’ll be in the form of an Intervention, or not at all.

A lot of time there’s considerable overlap in pay grades. Top end of intermediate may well be well above the beginning end of senior. If your new role has more responsibilities, you can make a case for a raise.

The question isn’t whether you company pays you on a senior scale or an intermediate scale. The question is how the job market values your skills, experience and role. If you’re underpaid in the market you might start shopping for a new position. 

Just keep in mind that the grass on the other side of the fence isn’t always as green as it looks on the company website.

You know the answer.

It's a sinking ship.

Interview for other jobs.

> "should I ask..."

You can _ask_, but if they are the type of company to give you a title bump without a pay bump, they're also not going to let you reduce your hours without cutting your pay further (or firing you).

Update your resume and start sending it around, the title is very nice.

### Comment 69 by u/Tapeleg91 (1 points)

No. You are not justified.

If you want to play hardball and negotiate, get another offer and make them decide if they can afford to lose you.

Jeez some of you all are big time corporate kiss asses. Start interviewing! Hell work both jobs! Just never leave this one. Only do this if you are really really good though. Like people around you go “damn that mfer is a single person swat team” lol

Admittedly I was surprised that a notable minority of the answers were actually pro-corporation

### Comment 71 by u/TopOfTheMorning2Ya (1 points)

I’m not sure why you would want a title bump without pay increase. Just sounds like more work/responsibility with nothing in return.

#### Reply 1 by u/9ubj (1 points)

I don't want a title bump without a raise lol. That's why I asked this question =P

### Comment 72 by u/publicOwl (1 points)

If you like the job and they want to keep you there, try and get other job offers and use them as leverage for a pay increase. If the director says no, they obviously don’t value you and you should take one of the competing offers or reduce your hours to make your hourly salary make more sense.

You should be paid what you’re worth. Don’t work for free unless it’s genuine volunteer work (which this is not).

Dude, literally had the same thing happen to me a couple days ago. 

My boss told me I should be grateful I got a promotion and a 2.5% payraise to senior when people are getting laid off in this industry

#### Reply 1 by u/9ubj (2 points)

Hahaha yep I got the same line - "You need to understand that the market is tough right now but we did everything in our power to give you this raise" implying that I should be grateful

Start the job hunt. The best time to find a job is when you have one. 4 years is long enough to reestablish your market value.

Then schedule a follow up meeting with the site director and negotiate your future raise. Say you understand there is no room in the budget right now, but how do we get to X in the next budget. (Where X is your current pay plus %20).

When they try to push back or ask you to justify it, say that everyone is already looking for other jobs. You are only going to accept something else if it pays 20% more than you make now. But if you know that your pay will be X within the year, you will hold those other offers to that higher standard of X + %20.

Then follow it up by saying that you enjoy working there, but if the right opportunity at higher pay comes along that you will have to give it serious consideration. You did just promote me without a raise after all.

It means they decide you're valuable but don't have money to give you a raise. Just work less.

You’re in a good position right now. Start putting in minimal effort, and start leetcoding. Leetcode for 4 months, and start applying to high salary jobs ($250k+).
