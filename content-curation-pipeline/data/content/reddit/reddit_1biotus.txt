# Transition to Software Engineer

Hi all, I have been doing data analyst/ tid bit of data science work for 3 years. My company is asking me if I’m interested in transitioning to software engineer. I’m in contracting so the work I would be doing wouldn’t be cutting edge but it would challenge me since I don’t have much experience with traditional software. Pretty much all of my experience comes from data related work so mostly Python, and R. Is this a realistic possibility? I think I would enjoy it but I’m nervous I’m overestimating my skills? If my final goal is data science/ai expert in some way, is this a good detour to take to get there? This is also coming on the heels of receiving a slightly higher offer for basically the same boring work I have been doing for the last little bit. So I basically have to decide to go forward with this transition, or take the other offer doing probably slightly more interesting work than I’m currently doing. I’m at a true crossroads and would appreciate some various perspectives. What are your thoughts?

Edit: So the initial prospect was exciting for me, however my coworker got promoted instead of me and now I have to report to someone that is the same level as me, yeah no thank you. I decided to take the other offer to be at a more analytics focused company.

I would 100% transition. Edit: I’d transition because, specifically, I work multiple jobs and I’d have more opportunities which would allow me to retire early. I optimize for schedules and job compatibility; and the bonus of a role that pays more off the top is better for me. I want roles that I can have many of. But specifically as to why de/swe v ds, I just don’t like the bitch work of DS. It’s more tedious and less impactful from my experience than just some lane analysis or report whereas pushing data around or is always helpful. I’m speaking from ~5 yoe doing supply chain, gaming, and tech ds work.

I second this as well. Software engineering offers a lot more opportunities, has a more well defined skill ladder, and usually higher pay. It's a more established discipline and engineering teams often have more budget too (vs analyst teams rarely do).

The career path for data analysts is usually becoming Analytics Managers, or Directors of Operations. Sometimes you can pivot to "Data Science" but that career path is also very fraught (many DS folks end up switching to ML Engineering). 

Now, of course, you have to \_enjoy\_ programming! If you prefer to get deep into data, stick with that instead! Or maybe find a role that lets you use data to influence the business (like Product Management).

Out of genuine curiosity, what makes you so set on transitioning if you were in that position?

### Comment 2 by u/eskin22 (67 points)

I would say go for it if you think you would enjoy it. 

I think with the way the world is going, a skillset that combines data science and software engineering will position you well. Heck, in my experience they basically expect this in a lot of cases for DS roles and SWE roles anyways.

I believe the line between DS and SWE concerning AI is going to become much more thin in the short run and thicker only in the long run.

#### Reply 1 by u/clvnmllr (4 points)

You’re essentially describing the ML Engineering / AI Engineering roles, which are relatively “hot” right now.

### Comment 3 by u/in_meme_we_trust (27 points)

I’d recommend doing it, software dev skills are already pretty crucial for data science jobs, and likely going to be more important over time with all of the cloud service abstractions.

### Comment 4 by u/Zer0designs (20 points)

Since you're familiar with Python, you need to check out ArjanCodes on youtube. If all these concepts are unfamiliar, learn them.

Also check out CodeAesthetic on youtube, again, you need to know the concepts of clean code & depenceny injection etc.

Good code is language independent, so saying you know R or Python just isn't enough information to tell if you'd succeed. 

Know what fast & slow ways of doing things are and why code runs fast/slow is even more important.

But then again, all this can be learned, if you enjoy it, I would transition definitely.

I love Arjans channel.

### Comment 5 by u/[deleted] (37 points)

Yes, I would do it. The single worst decision I have made is to go for DS/ML. I seriously consider to move to an entirely different field because it's a bad profession but I honestly don't know to do anything else. Before that, I was SWE and team lead and had fun. Now companies don't consider me to these roles.

I done it when the field was small, started to be hot and before ML was dominated by huge tech. The current state for people who wanted to be niche is pretty discouraging.

#### Reply 1 by u/buenavista62 (29 points)

Why is it a bad profession for you? And how does your job look like on a daily basis?

#### Reply 2 by u/[deleted] (5 points)

ML Engineer is a good path. Keeps your SWE skills sharp while staying in the ML field.

### Comment 6 by u/BraindeadCelery (13 points)

I did this transition 1.5 years ago! 

You learn SWE stuff best on the job if you have a team that takes care of developing you.

SWE definitely makes me a better data scientist as well. (I want do become a full stack ML eng at some point). 

In industry its often more valuable to integrate a decent model into production than to develop something that is a bit more accurate in jupyter notebooks but never leaves them.

Why did you decided to do the transition?

#### Reply 2 by u/Randomizer23 (1 points)

Was it easy to switch? If I have  DS degree, work a bit as a Data scientist, will companies hire me for SWE positions?

### Comment 7 by u/csingleton1993 (3 points)

Yes DA -> SWE -> DS is a viable path for sure, but it is also viable to go from DA -> (SDA) -> DS

It depends on your current skillset, how are you with Python? 

"I can print statements, manipulate dataframes, and that is about it" = take the job or kick up your self-learning a notch

"I can use native Python for a lot of things, and I can confidently handle APIs/data processing/blah blah blah" = might as well try for DS now

Me personally I'd go SWE first to get some solid coding practices first and then try to jump, but up to you. Also /r/datascience has a weekly entering thread that you could ask too

### Comment 8 by u/pach812 (2 points)

I think it’s a different role, but it depends on what type of applications you’re going to develop. I’ll take the change… you could always change back!

### Comment 9 by u/funny_funny_business (2 points)

I did this. Best decision ever.

#### Reply 1 by u/Randomizer23 (1 points)

Was it easy?

### Comment 10 by u/Correct_Gas_6104 (2 points)

I’m trying to the do the opposite, man. Best of luck, hope you like it

### Comment 11 by u/jimmy_da_chef (2 points)

do it


Data science skills + SWE = down the road MLE oppty

### Comment 12 by u/omserdah (2 points)

Facts

### Comment 13 by u/omserdah (2 points)

Do it up

### Comment 14 by u/munyua1 (2 points)

Go for it. You already have some background knowledge of python. I think the only go hard part will be learning new frameworks which still shouldn't an issue provided you are dedicated.

### Comment 15 by u/fiesty-r3dhead (2 points)

Making the transition from data science to software engineering is totally doable, especially if you've got some programming chops under your belt. Prioritize leveling up your skills in languages like Python and R, but don't forget about data structures and algorithms—they're key for engineering roles. Dive into resources like LeetCode and HackerRank for practice, and start building projects that demonstrate your coding prowess. It's all about showing you can tackle engineering challenges head-on. You got this!

#### Reply 1 by u/VDtrader (1 points)

Nobody in SWE code in R...  maybe Python but that's very limited for a SWE.

### Comment 16 by u/khanmz14 (4 points)

How many years of experience do u currently have

#### Reply 1 by u/cptsanderzz (4 points)

3, so I’m still pretty early into my career.

### Comment 17 by u/Cultured_dude (3 points)

Way more SWE opportunities. DS is now data or ML engineering. How do you plan on transitioning? SWE bootcamp?

### Comment 18 by u/murazzo (2 points)

Take the other offer. Stay in data

### Comment 19 by u/NotACloseEnoughMatch (1 points)

I made my transition from data analyst to BI then to software engineer. If your end goal is data scientist then this is not the right path for you. Also, once you make it to software engineer you would be downgrading your salary to transit back to data science field which makes it more difficult.

There are still path for software engineer which cross field of data science, e.g. ML/DL/AI engineer, applied scientist also works but usually I see more data scientist then software developer transit to it.

\* I worked in a FAANG and made my 2 career transition there. My current team is DS + Software focus.

### Comment 20 by u/Rough-Phrase6745 (1 points)

I would jump at the opportunity to learn software engineer with the support of your team, it's best learning on the job and having a team that backs you up is priceless. You can't lose from that, worst case scenario you go back to Data Science armed with the extra knowledge you accumulated, best case, you evolve to a new career stage with new opportunities.   
Anecdotally: My brother worked for a long time as a QA team lead, he studied programming independently and added layers of automation to his QA role, but when he tried to transition to a software development role within his own company, they preferred to keep him as QA team lead where he was bringing them value, and with time he grew more frustrated and bored. He now works as a software developer at a different company and is much happier!

IMHO there are two types of data science deliverables 

1. A document that changes opinions. Suppose you took observational data and applied econometric analysis (ex synthetic control) and concluded that A caused B, identifying profit increasing strategies. Or you designed an experiment, determined what factors to block/stratify on, etc. 

2. A production service. This could be optimization, ML/AI. But the key is that the service doesn’t require manual effort to invoke. It runs at scheduled intervals, in response to events, or synchronously given requests. In this latter design, you have to know a decent bit about infra, CI/CD, automated testing, system design, etc.

In my experience, people often get these categories mixed up, for example building an offline ML models that dies on your laptop.

It sounds that you have the opportunity to pursue the second class. It’s the way the industry is going, with the exception of research scientists (ML benchmark performance in a doc changes opinions, aka gets Eng funding to turn a type 1 deliverable into a type 2 deliverable.)

### Comment 22 by u/[deleted] (1 points)

Data Engineer would aligng more with your experience.

  
Data analysis and swe have small in common

### Comment 23 by u/thequantumlibrarian (1 points)

Everyone's telling you to do it but nobody's asking if youre working for a software development company or a company that takes advantage of your availability and will slap on software development on top of your data work for a very cheap price. 

If a company did that to me I would be super skeptical. This is unusual behaviour and a huge red flag for me. 

I feel like none of the people here have really been in a pure software development role (cuz it's a data subreddit lol) 

I transitioned from software development to data because I wasn't a good software developer. And more often than not with data scientists and analysts who code I notice a huge knowledge gap. Not saying that it's not doable, I am saying that data people are cheap coders with a very thin dev stack. Or maybe I am projecting. Who knows.

### Comment 24 by u/anomnib (1 points)

It is hard to get aware in AI without effectively become a software engineer, so you wouldn’t be deviating from your goal

### Comment 25 by u/Corpulos (1 points)

If you get the chance again in the future I would go for it as long as the new position will keep you within the sphere of data science. A SWE position at a data science company is just as good if not better than a DS position anywhere.

### Comment 26 by u/Particular-Weight282 (1 points)

It depends what you want to do for the long term. 1. building cool stuff, 2. building data analytics. Two very different jobs that both use programming at some level.

### Comment 27 by u/manoj-ht (1 points)

What advice would you give for a software engineer who would get into data science???

### Comment 28 by u/Doverkan69 (1 points)

From money perspective, I think stay on data is better at least in my country...

#### Reply 1 by u/FlyingSpurious (1 points)

Where are you located at?

### Comment 29 by u/VDtrader (1 points)

I say if you're still young (under 30), then you should go for it.  DS is a bitch work that I don't know why so many PhD's signing themselves up for.

### Comment 30 by u/CommunityFrog1234 (0 points)

You could become a software engineer without a degree. Work for tech support when you get a high school diploma and gain experience. After 5-10 years of tech support, look for a software engineering job. That’s what I would recommend for anyone here. That is what I heard from someone who just got hired this year in 2024.

### Comment 31 by u/[deleted] (0 points)

I honestly think these replies are crazy, maybe not from actual SE roles, and not from sudo SE management roles. Not saying you shouldn't do it, but yes, you most certainly are over estimating your skills unless your from a computer science or SE background. Depends on their specific role I suppose, but you mentioned maintaining and developing apps, really has fuckall to do with anything a DA would've done, unless you were writing software from scratch.

### Comment 32 by u/scamm_ing (-7 points)

They are downgrading you

#### Reply 1 by u/cptsanderzz (2 points)

In what way? I would be given more responsibility and a way to develop additional skills? With a potential promotion? I’m mainly wondering is this a good move for long term growth or hold out for other analysis data science opportunities.

### Comment 33 by u/No_ChillPill (-4 points)

Try to learn but know the difference is time spent on writing long scripts, and trouble shooting asap because more apps and software needs to be live asap 


Also don’t get paid anything less than $150k for software engineering - anyone getting paid less is like they’re being laughed at that they value they selves so little they get so less
