# Name and Shame: LoanStreet (NY) cheated me out of equity

I worked for [**LoanStreet in NYC**](https://www.loan-street.com/). Small company. <30 people. [**Cofounder/COO Christopher Wu**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriswu000) **told me my equity would start vesting after 12 months.** **After I started, they told me that they actually meant 12 months after the next quarterly board meeting, and I would only start to vest after 16 months.** I asked them to change it. They dragged their feet for months, pretending to work on it. **After 15 months of praising my work, they abruptly fired me just as COVID froze tech hiring, refused to vest any of the promised equity, and the head of HR (who is also the wife of the CEO and who had spoken to me warmly just the night before) refused to answer my phone calls asking for an explanation.** LoanStreet is run by fancy lawyers and they were crafty with the offer letter language so I had no legal case. The offer letter said the details of the equity compensation would come in a different document, which they didn't provide for almost a year after I joined. **If it was a good-faith error, they could have done the right thing and granted me what I earned. They chose not to.**

**The only problem I was aware of was that the** [**CTO Larry Adams**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/larry-adams-2a20b07) **was upset with me because I discovered one of his favorite engineers had broken mission-critical code, and I fixed it.** Basically this guy was making changes to financial code he didn't understand, and had erroneously +1'd in one place so he ended up -1'ing in a bunch of other places to offset the initial error and get the tests to pass even though some key, untested functionality was now broken. The engineer didn't remember why he had made the change and refused to help me investigate why tests were failing. I privately spoke to him to ask him to be careful with the code in that area because it was tricky, to leave comments if he writes something that might be confusing to another reader, and to feel free to ask me for help in that area since it was my niche in the company. I was trying to do him a favor by not making a more public stink about it. He immediately complained to the CTO, who called me 30 min later to sternly tell me that there was no error because we had tests that would have caught it and to scold me for going out of my lane. I wrote a failing test proving that the error existed and that our tests were incomplete. Then I fixed the error. He brusquely told me to fix anything I had broken by making that change. At the next retro "needs improvement" section I said I hoped we could affirm a team norm of being responsible for your code: being able to explain it and to help fix things if it breaks something. Larry Adams got mad and shut down the conversation. **For the next few weeks he worked behind my back to get me fired.**

[**Cofounder/CEO Ian Lampl**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-lampl-b7a5b684/), his wife and [**head of HR Alyssa Guttman**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alyssa-guttman-37133a4)**,** [**COO Christopher Wu**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriswu222)**,** [**CTO Larry Adams**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/larry-a-2a20111), and [**General Counsel Thaddeus Pittney**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tlpitney) are the people chiefly responsible for what happened.

Copying my [**Glassdoor review**](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-LoanStreet-NY-RVW48294594.htm) below. Please follow the link and mark it as helpful so that the message is amplified and as many people are warned as possible. LoanStreet fires people without warning and makes severance dependent on signing a permanent non-disparagement agreement, so we need to elevate the negative reviews they do have.** They have no legal fees because many of the top people are lawyers, and so they intimidate people into keeping their stories to themselves, even with "anonymous" outlets like Glassdoor available.

**Pros**

*They are willing to give boot camp grads a chance*

**Cons**

*TLDR: Stay far, far away unless you're truly desperate. LoanStreet is a raging dumpster fire and you will get burned like many before. After 15 months of praising my work - and as COVID froze the hiring markets in 2020 - they abruptly fired me and withheld $100k in options that they promised me before I was hired.*

*The annualized turnover rate in the small NYC office during my time there was around 50%. Every two months or so, someone was fired who said they weren‚Äôt given any warning and the company would tell the same story that this person was given many warnings and opportunities to respond to feedback. I saw a lot of good workers blindsided, some leaving in tears. I thought it was fishy and eventually it happened to me, despite always having received glowing praise from leadership.*

*Any promises made to you to entice you to sign an offer should be regarded with extreme skepticism. Get everything in writing and reviewed by a good lawyer.*

*After hiring employees with a promise of unlimited PTO, management rolled out a PTO tracking tool that explicitly capped PTO at 15 days per year.*

*Before I joined, Cofounder/COO Christopher Wu told me that the first quarter of my stock options would vest after a year. My offer letter said details on the equity compensation would be provided in a separate equity agreement. I wasn't provided that agreement for nearly a year after my start date, and you can imagine my surprise when I saw that I wouldn't begin to vest until nearly 16 months of employment. After 15 months of work, I was abruptly fired and didn't receive a single option.*

*Because the offer letter omitted the details of the equity compensation, labor lawyers told me I had no case. Keep in mind, LoanStreet is run by lawyers who used to worth at Cravath, a very prestigious and lucrative NYC law firm. I suspect they knew exactly what they were doing when they wrote the offer letter. If it was just a good-faith mistake, they could have done the right thing and granted me the options I earned. They chose not to.*

*Placing my trust in LoanStreet was a costly mistake. If you're reading this, please don‚Äôt be fooled by the Series B funding or the impressive pedigrees of the leaders; this place is a fraudulent, exploitative mess and you have a good chance of being fired within a year.*

*CEO Ian Lampl is the ringleader of this racket, but Cofounder/COO Christopher Wu, CTO Larry Adams and the rest of leadership are his spineless sycophants. They either agree with Lampl's despicable abuses of his employees or are too cowardly to stand up for what's right.*

*This group will twist employees‚Äô arms to post positive reviews after they see this one, just like they have in the past, but this review is the real story and just the tip of the iceberg, given LoanStreet's practice of paying fired employees to sign permanent non-disparagement agreements.*

*You deserve to be treated with dignity. Work elsewhere.*

**Advice to Management**

*Your exploitation of people is disgusting. Look in the mirror and ask yourselves how your loved ones would feel if they knew that you cheat people just to make your big piles of cash a little bigger*

I'll take this opportunity to remind everyone to take everything you read on the internet with a healthy amount of skepticism. Also, to remind everyone of our rules:

https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/posting_rules

Couple of reports on this one. 

> 3: It's targeted harassment at me

> 2: It's personal and confidential information

I'm going to reference the content policy on this one:

https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043066452

> ***Public figures can be an exception to this rule***, such as posting professional links to contact a congressman or ***the CEO of a company***. But don't post anything inviting harassment, don't harass, and don't cheer on or upvote obvious vigilantism.

I consider all of the individuals mentioned to be public figures, for the purposes of the above rule. There's nothing particular in this post that is inviting harassment of the individuals, and y'all seem to be behaving yourselves in the comments for the most part. There's a lot of good discussion and advice happening in the comments.

I consider LinkedIn profiles to be "professional links to contact [subject]". If y'all don't want your LinkedIn to be used for that, set it to private. This does not invite harassment of particular individuals -- and if you're seeing this thread fixing to message the leadership mentioned in this thread, don't. Don't do that. That's how you get this community restricted, and force mods to instate a blanket ban of this style of thread.

I‚Äôm still a student‚Äîshould this be considered an automatic red flag if they discriminate benefits or something in this way?

#### Reply 2 by u/rafuzo2 (19 points)

It‚Äôs a red flag to not include a brief description of the equity - the total amount, and the type - in the offer letter.

It‚Äôs totally fine and normal to get the legal disclosures of an equity share plan under a separate cover, including the rules around vesting and a ‚Äúwe recommend to the board OP get x units of RSU/ISO valued at y price‚Äù sheet which is the binding promise to pay you out. But a brief line about the total value of equity, and the type, should be part of an offer letter. Every company that‚Äôs given me equity has had that one or two sentence part in the letter. 

Two takeaways: 1) get all compensation listed in an offer letter, accept nothing less. ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs just a form letter and we haven‚Äôt updated it‚Äù is not acceptable. It‚Äôs the age of Google Docs, ask them to change it. Any serious pushback on this is a red flag.

2) when talking offers, be sure to ask the details of the vesting schedule. Anyone authorized to communicate an offer on behalf of a company should be prepared to explain this. Generally with smaller companies they will want to review any ISO/RSU offers at a board meeting but having the vesting schedule *not start until the meeting* is a tad sketch; it suggests the shareholders don‚Äôt have confidence the execs will use equity well. It‚Äôs not a red flag, more a yellow one. But a candidate should be able to understand their vesting schedule at offer time.

#### Reply 3 by u/RainmaKer770 (12 points)

What does that separate document generally have?

#### Reply 4 by u/senpaislayer1 (8 points)

When people ask me about this I usually tell them this:

If you are happy with what they initially offer and anything that they say is separate at a later time is a cherry on top then take it.

If you are unhappy with the initial offer and are hoping or leaning into them providing what they say they will at a later date then don‚Äôt take it. You‚Äôll be unhappy and they most likely won‚Äôt provide it.

This has helped me avoid companies and situations like this

#### Reply 5 by u/Admirable_Connection (2 points)

Yeah when I joined my current place the recruiters promised me whatever they‚Äôd offer would be far higher than my competing offers, and they were right. 

My employment contract and initial documents had a **lot** of detail spelling out all of my comp and benefits.

Fuck those guys.  Unlike most of these post, this is a legitimate and egregious name and shame.

> Because the offer letter omitted the details of the equity compensation, labor lawyers told me I had no case. 

C'mon people, this is the first rule of any job related.  If it isn't in writing, it never happened.  Never go by a verbal agreement for anything.  

And it isn't a matter of trust.  Let's say you trust someone completely.  Even then, things get lost in bureaucracy, someone misinterprets something, people leave (along with those verbal agreements), budgets get cut and the first thing to go is promises, etc.

### Comment 11 by u/[deleted] (116 points)

ymmv, working at startups < 10 people has given me opportunities to work across every single aspect of development, not just code. and got me into a senior position at a much larger company with fantastic benefits.

im sure i have some stock in both companies, i dont have the time to bother with the legalese or really care, the experience is far more valuable.

also i intentionally stayed as far as i could from internal startups within banks/hedge funds, and fintech firms.

i could never tolerate the way that industry treats people. its dehumanizing and just disgusting. it would take a 6 digit salary starting with a 5 for me to even consider it.

I recommend against it until you have a few years of experience under your belt. There‚Äôs a lot more freedom which means a lot more room for bad habits, and very rarely are the resources there to do proper mentorship for juniors, who tend to require a lot of time. I‚Äôve been working in small startups for half my career and when people ask me about it, I always tell them to work for a bigger, more structured company first. The scope of the work is smaller, you‚Äôll get to see how bigger teams can function and are organized, and you‚Äôll have more time for being mentored and learning the ropes. I specifically don‚Äôt look for juniors right now at my company because it would be a disservice to them. 

Once you‚Äôre pretty confident (and senior) I strongly recommend jumping into the startup world and seeing if it‚Äôs for you. You‚Äôll have a lot of autonomy, almost no guidance, and you‚Äôll have a broad range of technological experience - right now I‚Äôm designing the architecture for my company‚Äôs internal data platform, building multiple web applications on top of it (I‚Äôm not a web dev at all), integrating with outside services, automating our model training process, and more. You‚Äôll grow a lot in these environments but they‚Äôre not right for everyone. You won‚Äôt know until you try it though. 

tl;dr definitely spend some time at startups, but not early in your career. 


This situation with the options isn‚Äôt actually that egregious. Most equity agreements require board approval and those meetings take place *maybe* quarterly. They also require some kind of 409A valuation which take forever. On the other hand, the vest should always start from the start date, not the approval date.

#### Reply 4 by u/[deleted] (5 points)

A big risk is the company going out of business. If that happens you might have issues with background checks later on

#### Reply 5 by u/lovebes (3 points)

I would highly suggest you do. But keep the clock ticking for two years deadline of leaving.

You get to explore everything that a business does and how it trickles to code. You don't get that MBA level insight in a huge company where you are a replaceable expensive cog.

Do not pidgeon hole yourself to be just a programmer nor should you be content eith a cushy CS gig. Your life goal should be bigger.

But understand that you will see some crazy shit. Like Apocalypse Now! Level crazy, human evil and selfishness has no bounds level of shit.

Once you see them you can learn compassion to protect others from it, and also know how not to manage a team, wealth, and business.

#### Reply 6 by u/nraynaud (3 points)

I was desperate for a job, called a former CEO, he told me of meeting a couple of dudes trying to start a company. 
A few months later, first day at the office: 5m^2 in an incubator, in what I would call the Detroit of France (remember France is 1/5 fifth the size of the US) I was employee number 2 and there were 2 interns. I ask to get a copy of the code: "hum whose copy? we have never merged". I left the company after 3-4 years and a solid team in place.

long story short, ten years later I'm buying my house with the shares granted at that time.

I think if you're out of your element at school this kind of place could be good, they value non-traditional thinking, and you can gain rank quickly. If you're of a more "in the box" mindset, you'll just burn out trying to document processes and try to get things reproducible and the lack of visibility in the future will just consume you. You have to revel in a giant mess (for the first few years).

Nice name and shame. Also realized my offer letter also have the "stock options will be disclosed in separate document" and recruiter told me I should get the options doc at the yearly meeting next March.

While normally one should press for more details or risk ending up in a situation like this, I really didn't care much given I negotiated 40% salary bump and WLB and tech is so much better here (plus remote). Also was already told the options were 4 year cliff vest. So if I leave within 4 years (which I very likely will) it is worthless regardless. I am also a late joinee so the quoted stock option amount I got is pretty shit as well anyways. If company hits 1bil valuation it'd end up being 80k after 4 years. Company is estimated 250 mil rn lol. Kinda weird a start up gave me high base low stock but I'll take it. I'll prob leave before they can even try to screw me over lol

#### Reply 1 by u/[deleted] (21 points)

4 year cliff vest is maybe the worst vesting schedule I've ever heard of

#### Reply 2 by u/praetor- (3 points)

I'm in pretty much exactly the same position, almost no details on equity other than number of shares; I negotiated .5% but I don't know how many outstanding shares there are so I couldn't verify it.  I have no idea what the strike price of the options is, how long I have to exercise them after leaving, etc.  Only a 1 year cliff (4 is outrageous).

All that being said, I got a 35% bump on base salary so it's a fantastic move for me even if equity is worth $0 in the end.  I think anyone going to work for a pre-IPO startup should have this mentality.

I mean, the equity will be worthless anyway since it's options and OP would have had to pay cash to exercise them. Maybe it's worth getting them restored to make a point, but I wouldn't exercise options in a shitty company.

### Comment 31 by u/13ae (7 points)

The countdown to vesting happens after the rsu's are granted at a lot of companies, which is why it became 16 months (generally happens during the board meeting.

Definitely fucked up that they fired you right before for no good reason though, but it's no different than doing so at 11 months. The first part is standard, it's the second that's shitty.

#### Reply 1 by u/AchillesDev (5 points)

RSUs and options act differently. Options usually start vesting on the hire date and are backdated once board approval happens.

I worked for LoanStreet in NYC. Small company. <30 people. Cofounder/COO Christopher Wu told me my equity would start vesting after 12 months. After I started, they told me that they actually meant 12 months after the next quarterly board meeting, and I would only start to vest after 16 months. I asked them to change it. They dragged their feet for months, pretending to work on it. After 15 months of praising my work, they abruptly fired me just as COVID froze tech hiring, refused to vest any of the promised equity, and the head of HR (who is also the wife of the CEO and who had spoken to me warmly just the night before) refused to answer my phone calls asking for an explanation. LoanStreet is run by fancy lawyers and were crafty with the offer letter language so I had no legal case. The offer letter said the details of the equity compensation would come in a different document, which they didn't provide for almost a year after I joined. If it was a good-faith error, they could have done the right thing and granted me what I earned. They chose not to.

The only problem I was aware of was that the CTO Larry Adams was upset with me because I discovered one of his favorite engineers had broken mission-critical code, and I fixed it. Basically this guy was making changes to financial code he didn't understand, and had erroneously +1'd in one place so he ended up -1'ing in a bunch of other places to offset the initial error and get the tests to pass even though some key, untested functionality was now broken. The engineer didn't remember why he had made the change and refused to help me investigate why tests were failing. I privately spoke to him to ask him to be careful with the code in that area because it was tricky, to leave comments if he writes something that might be confusing to another reader, and to feel free to ask me for help in that area since it was my niche in the company. I was trying to do him a favor by not making a more public stink about it. He immediately complained to the CTO, who called me 30 min later to sternly tell me that there was no error because we had tests that would have caught it and to scold me for going out of my lane. I wrote a failing test proving that the error existed and that our tests were incomplete. Then I fixed the error. He brusquely told me to fix anything I had broken by making that change. At the next retro "needs improvement" section I said I hoped we could affirm a team norm of being responsible for your code: being able to explain it and to help fix things if it breaks something. Larry Adams got mad and shut down the conversation. For the next few weeks he worked behind my back to get me fired.

CEO Ian Lampl, his wife and head of HR Alyssa Guttman, COO Christopher Wu, CTO Larry Adams, and General Counsel Thaddeus Pittney are all dirtbags or dirtbag-accomplices.

Copying my full Glassdoor review below. Please follow the link and mark it as helpful so that the message is amplified and as many people are warned as possible. LoanStreet fires people without warning and makes severance dependent on signing a permanent non-disparagement agreement, so we need to elevate the negative reviews they do have. They have no legal fees because many of the top people are lawyers, and so they intimidate people into keeping their stories to themselves, even with "anonymous" outlets like Glassdoor available.

Pros

They are willing to give boot camp grads a chance

Cons

TLDR: Stay far, far away unless you're truly desperate. LoanStreet is a raging dumpster fire and you will get burned like many before. After 15 months of praising my work - and as COVID froze the hiring markets in 2020 - they abruptly fired me and withheld $100k in options that they promised me before I was hired.

The annualized turnover rate in the small NYC office during my time there was around 50%. Every two months or so, someone was fired who said they weren‚Äôt given any warning and the company would tell the same story that this person was given many warnings and opportunities to respond to feedback. I saw a lot of good workers blindsided, some leaving in tears. I thought it was fishy and eventually it happened to me, despite always having received glowing praise from leadership.

Any promises made to you to entice you to sign an offer should be regarded with extreme skepticism. Get everything in writing and reviewed by a good lawyer.

After hiring employees with a promise of unlimited PTO, management rolled out a PTO tracking tool that explicitly capped PTO at 15 days per year.

Before I joined, Cofounder/COO Christopher Wu told me that the first quarter of my stock options would vest after a year. My offer letter said details on the equity compensation would be provided in a separate equity agreement. I wasn't provided that agreement for nearly a year after my start date, and you can imagine my surprise when I saw that I wouldn't begin to vest until nearly 16 months of employment. After 15 months of work, I was abruptly fired and didn't receive a single option.

CEO and Cofounder Ian Lampl refused to discuss the matter. He just pocketed the options he promised me. Based on Lampl's valuation goal for the company, he defrauded me out of over $100k.

Because the offer letter omitted the details of the equity compensation, labor lawyers told me I had no case. Keep in mind, LoanStreet is run by lawyers who used to worth at Cravath, a very prestigious and lucrative NYC law firm. I suspect they knew exactly what they were doing when they wrote the offer letter. If it was just a good-faith mistake, they could have done the right thing and granted me the options I earned. They chose not to.

Ian Lampl is the lowest type of man: one whose word means nothing. He is a rich con man. His bland, polite, and nerdy demeanor is affected to disarm and distract you while he has his hands down your pockets.

Placing my trust in LoanStreet was a costly mistake. If you're reading this, please don‚Äôt be fooled by the Series B funding or the impressive pedigrees of the leaders; this place is a fraudulent, exploitative mess and you have a good chance of being fired within a year.

CEO Ian Lampl is the ringleader of this racket, but Cofounder/COO Christopher Wu, CTO Larry Adams and the rest of leadership are his spineless sycophants. They either agree with Lampl's despicable abuses of his employees or are too cowardly to stand up for what's right.

This group will twist employees‚Äô arms to post positive reviews after they see this one, just like they have in the past, but this review is the real story and just the tip of the iceberg, given LoanStreet's practice of paying fired employees to sign permanent non-disparagement agreements.

You deserve to be treated with dignity. Work elsewhere.

Advice to Management

Your exploitation of people is disgusting. Look in the mirror and ask yourselves how your loved ones would feel if they knew that you cheat people just to make your big piles of cash a little bigger

### Comment 36 by u/WideBlock (4 points)

you dodged a bullet.   The chances that the company will have a successful exit that makes engineers and even c-staff rich is very very small.  Reason?  they have to go ipo (almost impossible), or be bought by another company for very large sum of money.  most of the money will first go to all venture capitals, as they have put series A and B  funding. than all the lawyers that facilitated the exit, than the C-  staff and finally if anything is left, you would have got your tiny share.  In today's world never ever get equity in the company in lieu of salary.

### Comment 37 by u/lovebes (4 points)

Woah lots of red flags everywhere.

Were I a CEO or CTO I would hire you in a heartbeat. How you hustled to get the code correct, at the behest of potential friction with upper mgmt is ballsy. Love it. I love that pirate hacker attutude and it should dang well be celebrated. That is next level teamwork mentality.

### Comment 38 by u/Blrfl (22 points)

Everything else you wrote aside, some insight from someone who's been around the block with this multiple times:

 > My offer letter said details on the equity compensation would be provided in a separate equity agreement. I wasn't provided that agreement for nearly a year after my start date...

Why did you accept an offer with missing documentation?

 > ...and you can imagine my surprise when I saw that I wouldn't begin to vest until nearly 16 months of employment.

Stock option programs are administered by the board of directors.  They do grants when they meet and most plans don't allow grants to employees who haven't started yet or haven't signed the participation agreement.  It sounds like there was a grant, which means the agreement was signed sometime between signing your offer and a board meeting four months after you started.  That time plus twelve months before initial vesting in the plan would make 16 the correct number.

Participation agreements typically include an acknowledgment that a copy of the plan was received and that its terms are incorporated.  Signing something like that without having received, read and understood what was in the plan is on you.  None of this should have been a surprise.

 > After 15 months of work, I was abruptly fired...

If you were terminated for any reason allowed in your contract or it was simply at-will employment and the reason they had for letting you go didn't violate the law, they were well within their rights to do that.  You agreed to the terms when you accepted the offer.  It sucks, but that's life in the big city.

 > ...and didn't receive a single option.

It sounds like you were granted options but weren't employed long enough for them to vest.  Again, covered in the plan and agreement.

 > CEO and Cofounder Ian Lampl ... pocketed the options he promised me.  Based on Lampl's valuation goal for the company, he defrauded me out of over $100k.

This shouldn't be construed as legal advice, but making statements like that could get you sued for libel.  You don't have the truth as a defense here:

 * Under typical plans, un-vested or un-exercised options are returned to the pool for use as part of future grants.  The only way for them to come into the CEO's possession would be a grant by the board.

 * If LoanStreet's plan is typical and your options were handled in accordance with terms you'd accepted, it's kosher.  Dislike of the outcome doesn't make it fraud.

 * None of your options had vested.  Their value to you on the day your employment ended was zero.

Spoken like Ian Lampl himself

There is legality and there is morality. This post is about legal, immoral behavior. 

As I said, I don‚Äôt have a legal case. I use the word ‚Äúdefraud‚Äù not with its legal definition but in it‚Äôs colloquial, dictionary [definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/defraud) of 

‚Äúto deprive of something by deception or fraud.‚Äù 

‚ÄúFraud‚Äù I mean in its [definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fraud) of: 

‚ÄúDECEIT, TRICKERY
specifically : intentional perversion of truth in order to induce another to part with something of value or to surrender a legal right‚Äù

Both of those are the first definition listed for the word in Merriam-Webster.

If I ask a hundred people on the street if they‚Äôd clean my house in return for getting $1000 in a year, the vast majority will expect to receive it one year after doing the job. Some might expect a year after that conversation. Few or none will expect that they will receive it one year after a future event that I don‚Äôt tell them about. LoanStreet either intentionally deceived me or accidentally deceived me but have since refused to make it right by fulfilling what a reasonable person would consider to be the promise they made me.

When I say Lampl ‚Äúpocketed‚Äù the options, I am speaking of him operating in his role as the chief executive of the company, not saying that he personally took possession of the options

Perhaps you and the loanstreet execs do not, but most people hold themselves and others to a moral standard far beyond the minimum demanded by the law. It might be legal to take a $100 bill that you saw a blind man drop in the street, but it makes you a dirtbag, even if you can say that the blind man should have been more careful. There was a power and information imbalance in my interaction with LoanStreet. Ian Lampl saw a legal way to take advantage of it, and he did. I should have been more careful, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it wasn‚Äôt an unbelievably dirty and shameful move on his part, especially for a man who is quite advanced in his career to do to someone trying to get his first job in a new industry and who worked hard and well for him

For those who work at startups. Please hire a good lawyer who specializes in equity agreements to look over your documents before you sign!

I've learned. At the time I was job hunting as a boot camp grad without a CS degree, and was finding it hard to get interviews, so I didn't have the power to negotiate hard. The job was my foot in the door of the industry, and now I'm at a FAANG-level co and have more options. I wouldn't accept a contract like this nowadays

Sure, you can say OP is at fault for being naive. But that doesn‚Äôt absolve the company of all blame. It still sounds like a terrible and toxic place to work where verbal promises are readily broken.

Edit : yes the poster above did not say that the company is ‚Äúabsolved‚Äù from blame. Those are my words, but I‚Äôm not trying to mischaracterize that post. I‚Äôm just trying to add to the conversation, see if there is stuff that can be clarified, and discuss?Not trying to start a flame war or argument. Sorry, I‚Äôm a human, not a compiler.

#### Reply 4 by u/rhun982 (4 points)

Yes, and I highly encourage everyone to have them reviewed by an attorney as well. Went through a couple of consults and reviewed some of my past offers w/ counsel in employment law. 

Employment packages can have some complex documents, each of whose legal behavior is not exactly the same as the others.

Here's a rough outline of my findings:

(1) Offer letters aren't as binding as one might think, at least from the employee's perspective. 

   Good faith is a large driver of these offers. They provide a lot of cover for the employer, should they choose not to provide something that wasn't explicitly specified. However, not so much for the inverse: there's not quite a legal guarantee for the employee to receive exactly what is stated. 

(2) Options agreements are their own subcategory of legal document and are quite contractual

   These delineate strictly what the vesting schedule and amount you'll receive are, and *are* a lot more legally binding.

(3) Non-competes are difficult to enforce without specific, narrowly tailored scope. 

   California goes so far as to basically throw out any non-competition clauses. Elsewhere, similar language is likely to be disregarded if it is overbroad (geographically or sector-wise). Non-solicitations are much more binding, though, so be mindful.

(4) Be wary (and protective) if you have built or are planning any meaningful creations, inventions, or projects of your own motivation.

Intellectual property is a thorny thicket and you want to make sure that you're doing the best to safeguard the ownership of your thought product. This is something that I brushed aside before I'd spoken to a lawyer, but is something more important than I expected as one gains experience.

---

**Disclaimer:** These should generally hold true barring some edge cases, but I am not a lawyer. You should speak w/ a lawyer with expertise in employment law (maybe also an IP law attorney, but $$$ does add up) to get the specifics for your situation and jurisdiction.

---

**Note**: I understand that for one's first job or for anyone who needs to take a job ASAP, that this review might be difficult to have performed. I'd still recommend that after few months in that role or after your situation has stabilized that you seek a review. Some of these documents are actionable throughout your time as an employee, and sometimes even afterwards.

#### Reply 5 by u/ihavenopeopleskills (4 points)

Yop.

While it is OP's responsibility to negotiate aggressively on their own behalf and no one else's, we were all young, naive, inexperienced and way too trusting at one point.  OP has learned a tough lesson they will surely carry with them moving forward.

Company might be in the right but that doesn't change the fact they're being a colossal jerk.

I can understand a Band-Aid solution for the sake of a workaround.  They drive practitioners of the respective craft crazy and for good reason.  That having been said, good organizations won't blame the complainant when they're called on them: management will merely state "we've got to keep moving; we've evaluated the risk and we're accepting it" and move on.  Military units have to do things like this all of the time.

Just curious if I‚Äôm piecing this together correctly.  You said they screwed you out of basically 100k and you were expecting a quarter of your equity to have vested.  Are you saying they offered you 400k/4 in equity as a new boot camp grad?  At least at their valuation projections?

You should ask your insurance broker how much libel/slander insurance is. I pay $5 a year for mine from Allstate as a rider on my house insurance. It's cheap, and it means that a company full of lawyers can't shut you up just because you're saying true things about them.

### Comment 55 by u/themooseexperience (2 points)

I interviewed and (luckily) was rejected from LoanStreet about 18 months ago, although I wouldn't have taken the offer if I received it.

Between my phone screen and onsite interview, I can probably guess who the "favorite" engineer is that you're talking about. I can't remember names, but one engineer openly insulted and put down the other engineers running my interview *while I was interviewing.* It was super uncomfortable, and I got a very weird, disinterested, burnt-out vibe from the engineering team (aside from the favorite).

I'm looking at their website for the first time since December of 2019, and not a single thing has changed. It's not a promising look when a startup appears to have shipped virtually nothing in \~18 months.

### Comment 56 by u/[deleted] (2 points)

I couldn't figure out why this company seemed familiar until I checked the LinkedIn profile.

Yes, I specifically remember the CEO's wife.  She scheduled me for an interview, never showed and then completely ignored my subsequent attempts to reschedule.

Loanstreet is beyond unprofessional.... and seemingly, highly unethical.

Why are the google ads bad or why do they make his case worse?

If the story is true, the fact that he paid to promote his story doesn't change the fact that the story is true. Why do you think he posted it on reddit? To get people to see it. How is paying for ads to increase traffic to his post a problem beyond posting it on reddit in the first place?

Like the mods here have said, he didn't incite anything - he was warning people. I dont see why paying for ads to increase reach makes the goal of warning people worse?

Of course, if the story is a lie that is a different case - but that again is a different case regardless of the google ads.

### Comment 58 by u/romulusnr (2 points)

I've never trusted or taken seriously any offer of equity in tech. I guess fintech could be an exception, but still. It was usually a joke. Kind of like cryptocoin - - A few people made bank from it, but most people got useless paper, or never got the chance to vest.

#### Reply 1 by u/AchillesDev (1 points)

I don‚Äôt bank on it, but I‚Äôve made money from equity and many of my colleagues have too. It‚Äôs just a crapshoot and I treat it as an unexpected bonus if there is ever an exit.

\>  Cofounder/COO Christopher Wu told me my equity would start vesting after 12 months. After I started, they told me that they actually meant 12 months after the next quarterly board meeting, and I would only start to vest after 16 months  


While they probably did screw you over generally, that's typically how all equity grants work (or at least how it's always been my experience in receiving my equity grants).
