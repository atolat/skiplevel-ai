# AI is replacing juniors, so companies only hires seniors. If everyone is senior then what?

My startup is a perfect example of this. Mature, growth stage startup pulling in $250mm ARR. 

We have an eng org of ~300, and there’s less than a dozen junior engineers. I’m not even sure if we have mid level engineers. What we have are teams that look like this:

- EM
- PM
- Designer
- Senior 1
- Senior 2
- Senior 3
- Senior 4
- Staff 1
- Staff 2
- Senior Staff/Lead

So the senior roles are literally and simultaneously both the bottom of the totem pole and a terminal career stage. 

Why no juniors? AFAIK we haven’t hired a junior in 3 years. My guess is that AI is making seniors more efficient so they’d rather just keep hiring seniors and make them use copilot instead of handholding juniors.  

AND YET, our career leveling rubric still has “mentorship” and “teaching juniors” for leveling up to staff - what fucking juniors are there to speak of??

Meanwhile Staff is more of a zero sum game - there’s only a set number of Staff positions in the company. But all the senior want to get promoted to Staff to make more money, and keep getting promo denied. 

It’s all a fucking farce now. Can we just stop bullshitting and just agree that Staff is the new Senior, and make promos more regular. 

(Oh btw sorry juniors, you’re all cooked 🫠)

Edit: to all of you saying this is not an AI problem. Maybe, maybe not. But it absolutely is at my company. 

- exhibit A: company mandate to use AI
- exhibit B: company OKR to track amount of time reduced by using AI aka efficiency
- exhibit C: not hiring juniors

correlation or causation, you decide.

More like if you have a few years experience now you’ll be set. 5 years will put you at 7 YOE which is typically senior level.

Has it ever been different? I don't know any company that regularly promotes from junior to senior. Every senior I know got that title by changing companies.

#### Reply 7 by u/stuartseupaul (1 points)

I don't see that being an issue in 5 years, there's a glut of seniors and most are nowhere near retirement age. Management roles have also decreased so there's nowhere for them to get out of their terminal position.

#### Reply 2 by u/csanon212 (9 points)

Companies in general are really bad at workforce capacity planning.

At my prior company, there was a freeze on mid level devs during the late 2022-2023 panic. So, we only hired seniors.

Then, it turns out we hired too many seniors (who were probably overleveled mid-levels who recruiters squeezed into the pipeline, and were more than capable)

During the freeze, all the juniors went up to mid level, but they didn't backfill enough juniors.

I had a mid-level guy I wanted to promote to senior since late 2022 except he was now competing with really new hotshot promoted juniors at mid level, plus the pool became smaller because we had too many seniors.

The guy did nothing wrong except graduate in the wrong year.

This is akin to climate change. Everyone knows it’s not going to end well but no one is heroic enough to give a damn because everyone is chased by short term gains.

My prediction? Supply shock of Senior Engineers. 
1. Massive salary and demand spike for the real Senior Engs.
2. The bar for Senior Engs gets lower and lower as company NEEDS to hire someone at the end of the day. We may even see 1-2yoe to be considered “Senior”.
3. This will be even worse since the sentiment of SWE is at the absolute bottom now. Companies will eventually realize that LLMs don’t really replace humans, the code produced is buggy and Hackathon level quality. Meaning they actually NEED more SWEs to maintain these at the end.

#### Reply 1 by u/upsidedownshaggy (61 points)

We're 100% going to see a shortage of Seniors in probably another decade or so. It's going to be the same as the current tradesmen shortage in the US. Old crotchety trade workers who didn't want to train the next generation and actively worked to alienate the few who were able to break in are starting to retire and now you've got situations where tradesmen get to be pickers and choosers about the jobs they take because there aren't enough to go around. Like my parents can't find an electrician to replace some old wiring in their house because why would they take that job over one of the several months long contracts to do work on a bunch of new builds that'll pay way better?

#### Reply 2 by u/jcl274 (3 points)

The not training juniors and only hiring seniors is just a tragedy of the commons issue.

#### Reply 4 by u/csanon212 (1 points)

Anecdotally I've seen job postings lowering their years of experience requirements for principal and staff engineers. Total YoE required is probably only 2/3 of what was required 10 years ago.

Management roles also only require 6 total YoE even though most people are coming in with twice that experience.

#### Reply 5 by u/spooker11 (1 points)

Lowering the bar on hiring senior engineers is just hiring mid level engineers lmao

### Comment 5 by u/hajimenogio92 (34 points)

From my personal experience, I'm not sure if this is an AI problem or not. For all the companies I've worked in the past 10 years, I haven't seen a lot of junior positions in general. Most companies I've worked for don't want to take the time to train a junior or fresh grad. Especially when then the senior engineer can come in and hit the ground running

#### Reply 1 by u/Particular-Way-8669 (8 points)

I agree with this but it really is not the reason. Companies would hire juniors if it was guaranteed investment but it is not. The second junior gets experience he can leave for more money. And while company can pay him to stay, the thing is that the developer was there probably at loss for months if not years if you count in senior that had to spend time on him so if they just immidiately pay him market rate then they have to write it all off. It is simply just result of prisoners dilema problem in market where investing into juniors is competetive disadvantage.

### Comment 6 by u/myevillaugh (228 points)

This has been true of most companies for years. It takes a lot of resources to train junior engineers. If they're going to leave in 2 years, what's the point? That's why most job listings want 3-5 years experience.

#### Reply 1 by u/a_library_socialist (138 points)

Yup.  What happens then is the stuff that juniors could do gets done by seniors at 2.5 times the cost.

Ideal company is seniors doing architecture so the juniors and AI can do the grunt work more effectively and safely.  But nobody wants to build that.  Because it's a business society of next quarter profits only, and pass the mess to the next sucker/investor.

#### Reply 3 by u/jslee0034 (39 points)

Honestly the leaving in 2 years part is so real. In my country, we have a term called 중고신입 (antique/used newbie). Since everyone leaves in 2 years they just stopped hiring new grads and it’s making me and other soon to be graduates’ life so hard rn. 

I get the job hopping thing to boost your salary but it has its consequences too. Also better to give a 50k pay raise to a senior than spending time and effort + 80~120k to a junior/new grad. It sucks so much I hate it here

#### Reply 4 by u/UniqueIndividual3579 (6 points)

Even back in the 90's companies wanted at least two years experience, so getting that first two years is hard. The best way is to get an intern job. Being an intern is really a long interview.

Also anecdotally I've not seen a cohort of quality candidates come our way in some time. Not since pre covid. 
Candidates seem incapable of answering basic questions and seem to not understand the basic principles required to actually be able to solve a problem (like just basic algorithm abd data structure questions).

Maybe we just get bad candidates, but in this economy, it's hard to imagine that unemployed quality devs are not willing to apply to a fortune 500, especially junior ones straight out of uni.

That's my observation,  so do take it with a giant grain of salt. Idk if others have witnessed this as well? I'd be very curious to know if I'm an outlier here.

Yeah - this isn’t an AI thing, it’s just companies optimizing for the short term with a bit of tragedy of the commons. 

It makes no sense to hire juniors — they will just jump ship as soon as they have enough experience to be a net positive. I mean hell I did that after exactly a year at my first job in 2012, and doubled my salary. The incentives are set up to make that inevitable, but I don’t know what the solution is. Some sort of apprenticeship program?

Yup, and I’d argue that most juniors are so reliant on AI to do basic stuff today that there’s literally zero reason to hire them either. It’s not that AI is straight up replacing them, it’s that AI is warping their ability to actually learn how to do things. This is also happening to mediocre mid level and some seniors too.

#### Reply 12 by u/XiMaoJingPing (2 points)

I always get railed for saying this but juniors contribute to their own bad market too. Job hoppers leave a bad taste in companies mouth, and there are so many of them that they are just catching on that if you hire juniors you are basically just exhausting resources into them for a year or two and then getting 0 return.

Everyone always says "Well they should give room for growth", "They should pay better", "They should be promoted faster". I remember when being a mid level dev was 5+ and then seniors were 10+ now its like people want to get senior level pay when having 2-3 years of experience.

Downvotes speaks volumes about the people that browse this sub.

### Comment 7 by u/EnderMB (68 points)

I say this as someone that's spent the better part of a decade working in AI at a FAANG company, and someone involved in hiring hundreds of junior engineers.

No, AI is not replacing Juniors. Even the best models are barely close to replacing standard debugging tools.

Much like how many companies a decade or so ago tried outsourcing to India instead of hiring domestic engineers, and quickly learned that when you hire cheap talent from India instead of paying similar salaries for good domestic or good Indian workers, you get shitty work and your company suffers.

Anyone that tries to cut jobs due to AI will likely fail in the next 2-3 years, or when the AI bubble bursts - whichever is first.

Honestly, this sub has such terrible takes compared to /r/ExperiencedDevs that I wonder how it's still up and running...

Yea… the truth of this post is that sometimes a system is done being built. Hiring is done during a business’s expansion. Maybe OP’s business doesn’t need to expand it’s engineering staff, because the HC matches the pacing of company development.

It’s actually pretty cool that the organization actually issued so many promotions so far, instead of having arbitrary hierarchies preventing promotions.

EG even at FAANG sometimes an org will be “at capacity” for seniors and staff. So they won’t be able to promote.

#### Reply 3 by u/Beardfire (1 points)

I'm sure most people here know AI will not replace devs, but it's not us doing the hiring. It's the MBAs at the top who think they can save a buck. Granted, not all, but certainly some. And to your point about offshoring cheap talent, the same thing will happen and these employers will only realize that the hard way.

#### Reply 4 by u/-CJF- (1 points)

Like Torvalds said, AI is mostly marketing. It DOES have its uses but it is being sold as a complete replacement for humans and it's nowhere near that level. Probably never will be in my opinion.

I think in the long term AI is going to do more damage to the SWE profession than it helps. Too much abstraction is causing novice programmers to use the AI as a crutch rather than a tool and the number of new grads that can't get jobs is going to cause an exodus of people looking for other work.

### Comment 10 by u/dfphd (13 points)

We've seen what the answer is - at some point, when the economy gets a boost, everyone will need *volume* of talent. You will need dozens of people to do the tedious, grimey, hands-on work, and there won't be a ton of people to choose from.

Right now (much like back in the early 2010s) we're in a tightened stage where there is a lot more value being put on really high ROI or high visibility projects, and those tend to require more experienced people. But sooner or later we will go back to a state where the money isn't as tight and where companies are being pushed to find efficiency and value and margins and whatnot, and then you're going to need people. And you won't be able to afford to fill all those positions with senior people - and you wont' want to because it would imply hiring a lot of senior people just to have them do junior shit.

Now, here's the issue - as others have said, hiring and developing juniors is a thankless job *relative to how companies used to do this*. The plan used to be that you would hire the juniors, develop them, pick the best ones, and then keep them forever. In a time where it was harder to jump industries and where information on pay/comp/benefits/etc. wasn't as readily available, most people weren't jumping jobs every 2 years.

And so if you account for salary compression, hiring a junior employee was a great value, because you could compress their salary for 10-20 years and pay them half of what you'd need to pay someone in the open market.

Now, you can't do that. If you're going to hire and develop a junior employee, you're then going to need to work hard to keep them - you're going to need to pay them at least close to what they're worth. And so, considering it is expensive to develop a junior developer, a lot of companies won't want to.

Which, again, is a perfectly fine strategy in this market that we're in right now where a lot of experienced people are getting laid off.

But it is unlikely to last forever. And when we inevitably bounce back, we will have the same problem we had before.

They *will* hire highly educated kids from good universities. They're not anticipating software to be a growth industry anymore.

> My guess is that AI is making seniors more efficient

What are you basing this on?

Are the software engineers in your company all using "AI" tools?

Which of these AI tools are your teams using and are they able to measure subjectively, or objectively, any productivity gains?

Are your teams working on what are now legacy code bases, making incremental changes to complex systems?

Or are they, quite often, standing up brand new projects where boiler plate code is required?

My guess would lean heavily towards the former. It seems to me, the most common thing software engineers work on are legacy code bases, which are very complex. New code is not written that frequently, as most of their time is spent reading, debugging, and communicating/clarifying requirements. AI tools aren't so helpful at these types of tasks (unless I've missed some recent changes)

#### Reply 1 by u/jcl274 (3 points)

we have an active company mandate to use AI, and an OKR along the lines of "using AI reduces time spent doing XYZ", and yep it's a legacy codebase, over 10 years old, with a ton of spaghetti code

### Comment 20 by u/Joram2 (3 points)

This isn't true. Companies are still hiring juniors. Different companies choose to hire differently. There are individual companies not hiring juniors; there always have been. There are also individual companies not hiring seniors.

Most recruiters have said that AI hasn't meaningfully replaced hiring humans. AI has dominated the VC money and shifted the types of companies getting funded and hiring, and there is increased offshoring.

### Comment 21 by u/doktorhladnjak (2 points)

It’s more a consequence of increased interest rates and where we’re at in the business cycle than AI.

Companies are focusing more on profitability than growth. If you’re not taking on lots of new big projects, you don’t need to hire as many people. You can have teams of experienced engineers because enough are easy to find at the price you’re willing to pay. 

Hiring juniors makes more sense when you’re growing massively and need to hire lots of people. It gets very expensive hiring a large number of experienced engineers on a tight timeline. It’s basically not possible.

At some point on the growth rate curve, it shifts to being more efficient to hire fewer experienced engineers to mentor and guide an army of juniors because there are more juniors and they cost less.

### Comment 22 by u/UsualLazy423 (2 points)

I am seeing the exact opposite at the f500 I work for. Backfills for senior engineers are being downgraded to juniors for budget reasons and the number of seniors and principals per team/org is being explicitly limited. We just had a layoff and principals got hit especially hard because the company said the ratio of principals in the engineering org was too high. They are pushing for one senior per team and one principal per director and one senior principal per VP.

Small companies that can afford seniors will have no need for juniors. Saying they are the same is ridiculous. My company does this and the seniors are not treated like juniors, because they aren’t. They are good developers that know how a product team should function with a wide range of experience brought to the table to improve processes and performance day one.

Education inflation and multiple internships required to join as mid.

### Comment 28 by u/roger_ducky (1 points)

Staff happens when there’s room. Just like how there’s usually at most 2 CEOs.

You can’t expect to have tons of titles for you to feel a sense of progress at a small company.

### Comment 29 by u/[deleted] (1 points)

No, you're right. The issues that AI has are the same issues a junior would have, but it puts out the work in seconds or minutes instead of days. It's a sad reality. 

Companies only look at the next quarter they don't look at the long term and what it's going to do to them down the road if they don't have anybody who can actually program in the next generation without AI. 

I feel like in the future, knowledge is going to get more and more shallow, just like Google made knowledge more shallow and more external to our brains. We just look something up rather than store it in memory. 

It's very tempting not to even think deeply anymore, but rather throw the problem at AI over and over again until you get a usable result. This is our future, I guess.

The catch-22 is being more and more strictly enforced.

Soon you'll need 20 years experience, just to get an "entry level" job.

### Comment 33 by u/lifelong1250 (1 points)

The productivity gain when you hire seniors vs entry-level/junior is normally quite large.  Sometimes a senior is producing 2x-5x more output than a junior and the senior doesn't require as much training.  So, naturally management wants seniors.  During COVID when demand for developers was at a fever pitch, companies had no choice but to hire entry-level.

### Comment 36 by u/travelinzac (1 points)

Basically those of us with the correct skill sets will use AI to have the output of multiple teams as a single person. Juniors basically won't exist for the next 10 plus years. Once we start to retire there will be a huge shortage of competent people to lead the AI teams and then juniors will have to exist again.

### Comment 37 by u/Easy-Yam2931 (1 points)

Startups do this (in your situation) bc they need to hit the ground running to be fair. They don’t need or want juniors to mentor. However other companies need to make junior positions. I understand the “why train if they will leave soon anyways” argument but what’s lost on them is, they can gain someone else’s junior as well, and someone’s now senior if they still keep juniors in. 

When interest rates climb and jobs are scarce, junior/entry level positions are the first to die off anyways, I think they’ll open up when the rates start falling

### Comment 38 by u/mothzilla (1 points)

A place I used to work made everyone senior by default so they could bill clients more.

### Comment 39 by u/randonumero (1 points)

Without doxing yourself, what does your startup use junior engineers for? I work for a larger company but I tend to get screwed into being on smaller teams. While a huge part was expected 9/10 junior engineers I've worked with have been terrible (just like I was as a junior engineer). If I was at a small startup looking to move fast then I'd probably value mid-senior level engineers much more than juniors for anything other than support or maybe qa positions. 

One huge issue is that it takes time and money to train someone to the point where they're productive. For mid and seniors that time is generally a lot shorter. Given how much job hopping has often been the trend, short of getting a subsidy, most companies probably don't want to invest in junior engineers.

### Comment 40 by u/jokullmusic (1 points)

AI is not replacing juniors except in AI companies' marketing materials. If this is truly what upper management is saying is happening, they're getting duped by some AI company they've contracted.

### Comment 41 by u/lovebes (1 points)

Real question is what happens 30 years from now when all seniors retire

### Comment 42 by u/Harami98 (1 points)

if they are not hiring junior than they stop practicing this hierarchy or leveling system, hire us based on skills. There should not any level just position with required skills. Everyone is faking there resume might as well just hire based on merit and skills not level.

### Comment 43 by u/hindumafia (1 points)

Not all. Lot of juniors and mid level developers are employed.

### Comment 44 by u/Eastern_Interest_908 (1 points)

It's very simple. You can find mid/senior you hire mid/senior if there isn't any you hire juniors. 🤷

### Comment 45 by u/CircusTentMaker (1 points)

I've worked on a team with all senior eng, where there really wasn't any carrot on a stick of promotion. It was incredible, we got so much shit done so fast. I highly recommend it if anyone ever had the opportunity. I know it's not "sustainable" but it does make for a great strike team to build something specific

### Comment 46 by u/lordnikkon (1 points)

this has been a thing for for 10 years now. No company wants to hire juniors who they need to train and then just leave for better pay once they become a senior. Netflix even used to explicitly say dont bother applying if you are not already a senior because they dont hire anyone below senior level

### Comment 47 by u/CVisionIsMyJam (1 points)

This has nothing to do with AI. If I had $250mm ARR, and I could afford to hire only senior developers I wouldn't hire juniors either.

Why would I trust part of my $250mm ARR company to even a single junior developer? I'd rather hire the best people I can and simply have things work. Let start-ups, consultancies, smaller shops and big companies deal with new developers.

You likely have title inflation at your company. How many YOE do all these people have?

### Comment 49 by u/Zenin (1 points)

Oh, World Of Warcraft figured this one out years ago.

Every expansion (ie new tech fad) you level squash.  All your Seniors at max level 120 are now level 50 and you all get fresh Green gear (AI coding assistants) that make your old Mythic gear (Stackoverflow) obsolete.  You hate the new skill system, ditto how much they've dumbed the game down, miss the Classic days where leveling a new character was *hard and slow,* and all your mods broke...again.   Also this new lore of distopion tech-feudalism is soo dumb and breaks all the classic canon!

### Comment 50 by u/kd7uns (1 points)

Sometimes it feels like there are no junior engineers in name because everyone with more than 2YOE is calling themself a senior engineer.

### Comment 51 by u/Other_Information_16 (1 points)

I was wondering which way ai in coding would go. When it all started I thought either ai make juniors good enough so they fire seniors to save money or they make seniors so much more productive they just fire all juniors. Seems like the later is becoming true.

### Comment 52 by u/waba99 (1 points)

I recently did a job search and a lot of companies simultaneously were only hiring seniors and interviewing me about my mentorship skills. Why does it matter? Are we all going to be mentoring each other?

AI is NOT replacing any Junior engineers! Companies are just using AI as a justification lay people off.

### Comment 54 by u/Somerandomedude1q2w (1 points)

I honestly don't know. The market for juniors is brutal now, and it possibly will only get worse. I haven't thought about it too much, because I am already with experience.

### Comment 55 by u/Explodingcamel (1 points)

This type of company has never hired a lot of juniors. Meta, Google, Bloomberg, and Amazon for example are still hiring tons of juniors

Your experience with AI (company forcing you to use it) is weird and not typical

The only juniors that get hired are the ones that have the aptitude to be 10X devs. Yes - it’s possible to determine aptitude and how close someone is to 10X.

### Comment 65 by u/DaiTaHomer (1 points)

I am going guess here that eventually the expected productivity gains are not going materialize. The labor market will tighten up again. The world is demanding more and more software. These senior devs are going to get to be too expensive. The natural solution is to hire juniors as orgs expand.

### Comment 66 by u/Ok-Neighborhood2109 (1 points)

If there is no entry level hiring then senior level employees will eventually be exclusively hired from foreign markets where junior roles do exist. 


It coincides with all the other ways the USA is on the slide.

### Comment 70 by u/Coreo (1 points)

Even before AI I dont think i've ever been at a large company that had a decent number of juniors.

It always seemed like, and from my experience, that juniors start at very small companies, building up a portfolio of work, and then interview at a larger company to become a mid-weight.

### Comment 71 by u/[deleted] (1 points)

Here’s what going to happen. No one hires juniors for a new cycle or two. Seniors own the market and can name their price. Upper management gets pissed off that the engineers make more money than them. They attempt to outsource or hire juniors to train in house. All of the out sourced projects fail as they always do. Some of the juniors show a lot of promise and work their asses off. They hire more juniors and the office returns to its natural order. AI is a good tool, it is not a replacement for people. Many companies have opted to discover this the hard way.

### Comment 72 by u/redditmarks_markII (1 points)

Idiots and fuckwads hires only seniors and expect ai to replace juniors...today.  Megacorps will hired a bunch of super seniors to run the ML/DL to one day replace junior's CURRENT WORK.  less irresponsible or wealth orgs will hire a few ML/DL folks, build internal tools, have everyone leverage them.  Mostly to get human readable summary of docs, scaffolding etc, because who has time for that?  There will be medium sized companies out there hiring a lot more junior folks in order to have them ramp up quickly using those tools.  Because in established places, institutional knowledge is usually king.  Then you have a new breed of juniors and seniors.  There will always be juniors and seniors.  They just won't necessarily do what they do today.  Shit, we used to code.

Giving it 3-4 years, my hourly rate will be insane. I will be eating caviar for lunch.

### Comment 74 by u/nonsensical_drivel (1 points)

Large company and very similar situation. 

Senior is the new entry level, and to get to staff/managerial equivalent now requires both in depth technical and rainmaking skills.   
  
From the company's viewpoint, rainmaking ability directly leads to higher profits, and allowing the firm to save on other labor costs. A salesperson/engineer who can both make and sell the goods is better than a pure salesperson or a pure engineer.

### Comment 75 by u/BigCardiologist3733 (1 points)

as AI advances, less seniors will be required so the problem will solve itself

### Comment 76 by u/ivancea (1 points)

Senior, senior+, staff, senior staff, principal, senior principal, distinguished engineer. All of them potentially with I/II/III levels. I've also seen things like Expert, out other random words. There are many roles a company can use, and they're the ones that define the rubrics and how to move between them. 

If everyone is a senior, everyone is a senior. That's it. I don't get what your question is. It's the same as if there were juniors too. Seniors will still be seniors.

### Comment 77 by u/AntiqueFigure6 (1 points)

To me Exhibits A and B are red flags - when companies specify some specific tool - like Lean or Agile or AI  - to achieve a goal, rather than telling employees to find the best tool it’s a sign management are not thinking critically or strategically about how to succeed.

### Comment 78 by u/flatabale (1 points)

It won’t last forever

### Comment 79 by u/tragically-elbow (1 points)

Exact same story here. Slightly smaller headcount but I think there are like 3 junior devs at the entire company at this point (none on my team).

### Comment 80 by u/ah2870 (1 points)

Juniors are just so hit or miss

I’ve mentored 7 of them so far. Three have turned out great and the other 4 were massive time sinks that never turned the corner

Whenever my teams want to bring on a junior now, I actively discourage it unless we are in a very solid state, with plenty of work that isn’t time sensitive yet still meaningful for them to do

### Comment 86 by u/sonstone (1 points)

Part of it is still fallout from the ridiculousness of the past 5+ years or so.  I know people are tired of hearing it, but when companies are so bloated and suddenly have to make money because the free cash stops flowing it takes a while to correct.  We were very early to the reset game and have been hiring back steadily the past year and a half.  We hired a ton last year and all seniors+.  This year we are hiring some intermediate.   Next year we will hire juniors again.

### Comment 87 by u/Xanchush (1 points)

I will say you need a healthy balance between both juniors and seniors. If you have only juniors you'll run up into tons of tech debt long term and other issues. If you have only seniors they'll eventually burn out depending on the work you do since someone needs to do the grunt work. Usually Juniors help invigorate your team and also help improve simplicity amongst your codebase. Whilst seniors provide reliability, guidance and foresight.

Granted this is a very broad take on the matter and there are nuances and outliers to this.

### Comment 88 by u/knowitallz (1 points)

AI makes senior developers slightly more productive 

AI makes juniors think they know what they are doing only to find out their code doesn't work

Juniors have to figure it out without AI

So no one hires them

There there are developers who aren't good and are slow. They are just like juniors but stuck in their ways. AI will make their code even worse

### Comment 94 by u/ComradeWeebelo (1 points)

If everyone is senior, then no one is senior.

I have friends that work on teams where everyone is a senior.

Nothing gets done. 

All they do is spend countless hours arguing with each other over what the best way is to do something. Numerous meetings, emails, Teams messages, etc...

And then when it comes to actually doing the work, no one wants to do the "boring" stuff they would normally have a junior do because they want to reserve their skills for the high visibility, ninja-rockstar coding and designing. 

And again, nothing gets done.

Teams that exist purely of senior programmers is a massive mistake for any company to make.

### Comment 95 by u/Marcona (-1 points)

Juniors are absolutely cooked. And yes it is 100% because of LLMs. Us senior engineers are able to increase our work output by so much more now. 

Some people actually think they are gonna want to hire more juniors to overlook the potential code from AI. Let's be real, ain't no one gonna hire a new grad to ensure an LLMs output is up to par. 

Some people here actually think companies care about everything else but money are delusional. They think that AI is gonna make it so engineers can work on harder problems and spend their time figuring things out that are tougher. 

Since when do companies ever do shit like that. Hell nah, they aren't keeping them to throw bigger problems to solve their way. They let them go so they can save money.
