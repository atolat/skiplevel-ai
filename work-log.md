  - Added error isolation to prevent cascading failures
  - Reduced runtime by up to 8x for larger URL batches

- âœ… **Error Handling Improvements**
  - Added safe numeric conversion with fallbacks
  - Implemented more detailed error logging
  - Enhanced type safety across the codebase
  - Added graceful degradation for API errors

- âœ… **GitHub Repository Cleanup**
  - Removed API keys from code and commit history
  - Added security notes and environment variable usage
  - Fixed package dependencies in pyproject.toml
  - Updated .env file template in README

- âœ… **Evaluation Enhancements**
  - Refined specialized evaluation criteria
  - Added technical accuracy, actionability, and evidence-based metrics
  - Implemented weighted scoring system (30/30/20/10/10)
  - Added specialized Reddit content evaluation

- âœ… **Content Caching System**
  - Implemented URL and content caching to avoid reprocessing
  - Created JSON-based persistent cache storage in data/cache
  - Added automatic cache expiration based on age
  - Added CLI flag for bypassing cache when needed
  - Added statistics about cache usage in output
  - Added content hashing for deduplication

- âœ… **Book and Resource Integration**
  - Implemented automated discovery of high-quality engineering books and papers
  - Added modules for resource discovery from various sources:
    - arXiv papers on software engineering and leadership
    - GitHub repositories with engineering management content
    - Engineering blogs from top tech companies
  - Created specialized content processors for different resource types:
    - PDF extraction for academic papers
    - README and markdown parsing for GitHub repositories
    - HTML extraction for blog articles
  - Added pre-vetting of discovered resources to bypass evaluation
  - Implemented caching for discovered resources
  - Added CLI flags for controlling resource discovery

- âœ… **Medium API Integration**
  - Created specialized module for Medium content discovery
  - Implemented multiple discovery strategies:
    - Topfeeds for trending topics
    - Recommended feed for personalized content
    - Search API for targeted queries
    - Author-based discovery for curated content creators
  - Added content extraction and text file storage during discovery
  - Created standalone script with detailed statistics
  - Integrated with main pipeline and cleanup processes

### In Progress

- ðŸ”„ **AWS Deployment Planning**
  - Created workflow.md with deployment architecture
  - Need to create Terraform templates

- ðŸ”„ **Modular Content Source Architecture**
  - Created specialized Medium discovery module as first implementation
  - Need to refactor other content sources (Github, ArXiv, engineering blogs) to follow same pattern
  - Goal: Create specialized modules for each content source with:
    - Source-specific discovery logic
    - Dedicated processing capabilities
    - Content extraction tailored to source format
    - Specialized caching strategy
    - Standalone execution option

### Upcoming (2025-05-04)

- ðŸ“‹ **Qdrant Vector Store Integration**
  - Set up Qdrant for vector storage
  - Implement embedding generation with OpenAI
  - Create storage and retrieval interfaces

- ðŸ“‹ **RAG Evaluation Pipeline**
  - Create a simple testing framework for RAG quality
  - Develop evaluation metrics for retrieval performance
  - Build test cases based on engineering career questions
