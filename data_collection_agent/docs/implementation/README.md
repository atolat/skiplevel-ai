# Implementation Details

This document describes the implementation details of the Data Collection Agent.

## Pipeline Architecture

The Data Collection Agent uses LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) to compose a pipeline of tools. The pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. **Source Selection**: Selects relevant sources based on level and dimension
2. **Content Fetching**: Fetches content from selected sources
3. **Content Chunking**: Generates chunks from fetched content
4. **Chunk Storage**: Stores chunks in Qdrant with embeddings

## Tools

### Source Selection

The `select_sources` tool uses a language model to select relevant sources based on the level and dimension. It takes a level and dimension as input and returns a list of sources with metadata.

### Content Fetching

The `fetch_content` tool uses Tavily to fetch content from sources. It handles both web pages and PDFs, and includes built-in retries and error handling.

### Content Chunking

The `chunk_rubric` tool uses a language model to generate chunks from content. It takes content, level, and dimension as input and returns a list of chunks with metadata.

### Chunk Storage

The `store_chunks` tool stores chunks in Qdrant with embeddings. It uses OpenAI's embeddings to generate embeddings for chunks and stores them in Qdrant.

## State Management

The pipeline uses LangChain's state management to pass data between steps. Each step receives the state from the previous step and returns updated state.

## Error Handling

The pipeline includes error handling at each step:

- **Source Selection**: Handles invalid levels and dimensions
- **Content Fetching**: Handles network errors and invalid URLs
- **Content Chunking**: Handles invalid content and chunking errors
- **Chunk Storage**: Handles storage errors and invalid chunks

## Configuration

The pipeline can be configured using environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key for language models and embeddings
- `TAVILY_API_KEY`: Tavily API key for content fetching
- `QDRANT_URL`: Qdrant URL for chunk storage
- `QDRANT_API_KEY`: Qdrant API key for chunk storage
