# skiplevel

**skiplevel** is an AI-powered growth system for engineers who are tired of waiting for their manager to notice them.

### Why this exists

> Engineers don't need performance reviews.  
> They need a mirror, a map, and a little less bullshit.

Let's be real:
- Promotions are political.
- Performance reviews are vague, biased, and retroactive.
- Good managers are rare. Bad ones are calendar-sitters who can't remember what you worked on.
- Your career shouldn't hinge on whether your manager had a good night's sleep before your performance review.

So we're building something else.

This is not:
- A performance review tool  
- A journal  
- A fancy OKR dashboard  

It's your career's **version control system**â€”without the gatekeepers.

### What skiplevel stands for

ðŸ”¥ **Built for:**
- Engineers who are good at their jobs but bad at self-promotion
- ICs tired of "being more visible"
- People who want to grow through impact, not politics

ðŸ’¡ **Beliefs:**
- **Impact > Optics**  
- **Growth > Vibes**  
- **Truth > Perception**

ðŸš« **No babysitters. No gatekeepers. No emotional roulette.**

You've leveled up enough. Now it's time to **skip one**.
