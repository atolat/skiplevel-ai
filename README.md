# skiplevel
**skiplevel** is an AI-powered growth system we're building for engineers who are done pretending their manager gives a 💩 about their career.

### Why this exists

> Your manager is not your career counselor.  
> They're a meeting coordinator with opinions.

Here's what nobody tells you:

- **Your "manager" peaked at Senior Engineer.** They got promoted because they showed up to meetings, not because they understand career growth. Half of them are googling "how to give feedback" before your 1:1s.

- **Performance reviews are corporate theater.** They're written by people who couldn't tell you what you worked on three months ago, calibrated by committees who've never seen your code, and designed to justify decisions that were already made.

- **"Be more visible" is code for "play politics."** Translation: spend less time shipping code and more time in meetings explaining why your code matters to people who wouldn't recognize good code if it optimized their coffee machine.

- **Promotion committees are popularity contests.** They're staffed by people who mistake confidence for competence and mistake being loud for being right.

Your career trajectory shouldn't depend on whether Karen from People Ops thinks you "demonstrated leadership" in the Q3 planning meeting where you said exactly three words.

So we're building this instead.

### What this is NOT

🤡 **Another performance review tool** - Because the last thing the world needs is more bureaucratic bullshit  
🧸 **A journal app** - We're not therapists, and your feelings aren't getting you promoted  
🔮 **An OKR dashboard** - OKRs are corporate horoscopes and everyone knows it  
🎪 **A "growth mindset" cheerleader** - Save the motivational quotes for LinkedIn  

### What this IS

🩸 **Career version control** - Track your actual impact, not your manager's mood swings  
🏹 **Promotion case generator** - Build bulletproof arguments while your manager figures out what "staff level impact" means  
🔪 **Bullshit detector** - Cut through corporate speak and focus on what actually matters  
⚔️ **Skip-level prep** - Get ready to have the conversation your manager should have been having with you

### Who this is for

🔥 **You, if you:**
- Ship code that matters but your manager takes credit in the exec summary
- Get told you need to "work on communication" because you prefer Slack to pointless meetings
- Have been "on track for promotion" for longer than it takes to deprecate a JavaScript framework
- Know you're senior level but keep getting junior-level feedback
- Are tired of being managed by people who couldn't debug a print statement

🤢 **Not for you if you:**
- Think "culture fit" is more important than technical competence
- Believe your manager when they say "budget constraints" while hiring three more PMs
- Are satisfied with annual 3% raises and pizza parties
- Think code reviews are for finding syntax errors

### What skiplevel believes

🎯 **Impact > Office Politics**  
Your code either works or it doesn't. Your manager's opinion of your "executive presence" is irrelevant.

🚀 **Shipping > Talking About Shipping**  
You're not a product manager. You're not a scrum master. You write code that solves problems. Act like it.

📊 **Data > Feelings**  
"I feel like you should be more senior" is not feedback. "You reduced API response time by 40% and prevented three outages" is a promotion case.

💀 **Results > Process**  
Nobody cares that you followed the sprint ceremony to the letter if the product still crashes on weekends.

### FAQ

**Q: Will this get me promoted?**  
A: It'll give you better ammunition than "I've been here a while and I work hard." 🎯

**Q: What if my manager doesn't like data-driven career discussions?**  
A: That's what skip-levels are for. 💀

**Q: Is this better than just switching jobs?**  
A: Switching jobs is always an option. This just makes sure you're switching for the right reasons. 🚪

**Q: Will this replace my manager?**  
A: We can't replace someone who was never really managing in the first place. 🤡

**Q: When will this be ready?**  
A: When it's ready. We're not rushing this to hit some PM's arbitrary deadline. 🏗️

Being built by an engineer who believes you shouldn't need permission to grow. 🚀

Powered by caffeine, frustration, and the unshakeable belief that "let's take this offline" is the corporate equivalent of "we'll circle back." ☕💀
